INSERT INTO `architecture` VALUES (2,'STREET FACADE (fig. 2.4, plate 2.1)\n\nSince the street facade is virtually all that survives of the pre-\nOttoman constructions on the site, our attention will focus on\nit. In order to clarify the sequence of construction of the five\nprincipal components that make up the present facade we shall\ndiscuss each phase of construction individually.\n\n@) First phase\nThis comprises the lowest courses of stones varying in height\nfrom three courses at the east end of the facade to one course\nunder the east jamb of the reading room doorway. The stones\nforming these courses are roughly squared and project about\n0.08m further into the street than those of the rest of the facade.\nThese stones must be the remains of an earlier building on the\nsite. Some of them have been cut back in places, possibly at a\nlater date, to form shallow ledges whose purpose is not known.\nTowards the middle of the facade the upper voussoirs and\nkeystone of a slightly pointed arch can be seen in Creswell’s\n1920 photograph (plate 2.1). Part of the pavement beside this\narch was dug up to install a new sewer in 1982, allowing more\nof the arch to be inspected. It appeared then that the stones\nfilling the arch are later insertions intended to block it; it is\nimpossible to say when this was done without archaeological\nexcavation. The arch itself may once have served to roof the\nmain aqueduct carrying water from ‘Solomon’s Pools’ to the\nHaram, which turns east down Tariq Bab al-Silsila at about this\npoint.\n(ii) Second phase\nThis is a series of archways that extend eastward from the\nreading room. Piers supporting pointed arches rest on the\nrough masonry foundation of the first phase. Three archways\nsurvive although there may once have been one or two more to\nthe east. Originally open, they are now largely filled with later\nwork, the two western ones having been incorporated into the\nturba complex (see below) and the eastern one divided into\ntwo shops. Traces of partition walls on the inner (southern)\nfaces of the piers (plate 2.2) indicate that each of the archways\nopened into a separate chamber, probably intended as a shop\n\nEe Pain AEH Pc ea AD Se ee a ii a my ete RR rm Yond Weve eid Mapes Rear at ey\n up the street, which are almost certainly Crusader.” To judge\nfrom the stone dressing, the three belonging to phase (ii) are\nalso Crusader. Further indication of their Crusader origin may\nbe found in six curious circular shields, discussed below,\nwhich are carved about shoulder height in the masonry of the\npiers (shown in fig. 2.4).\n\nThe springers of the arches are set back about 0.10-0.15m\nfrom the jambs of the piers below, thereby forming a ledge that\nmight have supported a beam spanning the archway. Attrition\nof the blocking masonry in the tympanum of the western\narchway has exposed a 0.01m square groove in the intrados of\nthe arch, 0.08m from the face, connecting sockets 0.07m square\nand 0.03m deep at about 0.35m intervals. The groove and\nsockets could have held a frame supporting timber boarding\n(or something of that sort) in the tympanum. Such an\narrangement would allow the shops to be securely closed by\nsimple rectangular doors.\n\nOne course above the keystones of the archways a cavetto\ncornice with a square downturn at its west end (see plate 2.1)\nextends across the facade as far as the right-hand haunch of the\nthird (eastern) arch. Originally it would have continued further\neast to include at least the third arch, but that section is now\nmissing as is a section above the middle arch where four\nsculpted corbels have been inserted (see below).\n\nThe west pier of the arcade is wider than the others,\nindicating that here was the west end of the arcade where any\nresidual lateral thrust from the vaults had to be accommodated.\nIt is pierced by a rectangular window which appears to be an\nintegral part of the original structure; the third course of\nmasonry above its lintel has been cambered as if to spread the\nload onto the window jambs rather than the lintel. The height\nof the sill, originally 0.89m above present street level, has been\nraised 0.50m or so at some later date ( see fig. 2.4). Quite what\nthe purpose of this window was is hard to say. The east side of\nits interior embrasure is straight but the west side skewed so as\nto admit light to the reading room (see plan, fig. 2.3), and the\npresent east wall of the reading room is chamfered at its north\nend to avoid blocking the window. If the west pier containing\nthe window originally extended back southwards to form the\nwest wall of the arcade, as traces of Crusader masonry in the\neast wall of the reading room (plate 2.3) would appear to\n suggest, then we must assume that the window was then either\nsimply a recess cut into the pier or that it opened into a space\nentered either from the archway to the east or from the lane to\nthe west. The purpose of such a recess or space can only be\nguessed at, but it should be noted in this context that four of the\nsix circular shields on the facade are to be found on the jambs\nof this window.\n\n(iti) Third phase\n\nThis is the facade of the reading room, the main feature of\nwhich is the Romanesque doorway (now a window) (figs. 2.7,\n2.8). This facade abuts directly on the last pier of the arcade. A\nstraight vertical joint with only minor irregularities near the top\n defines the conjunction. Above the level of the doorway the\nstonework of the facade is stepped in about 0.05m on either\nside, one course higher at the west side than at the east side.\nThese steps in the masonry may indicate that the upper part of\nthe facade was rebuilt at some time. At a level one course above\nthe higher of the two steps a cavetto cornice, very similar in\nprofile to the one over the arcade, runs across the facade and\nterminates in curved downturns at each end. The masonry\nabove this cornice belongs to the fifth, late Ottoman, phase and\nsupports the north end of a tiled monopitch roof over the\nreading room.\n\nThe Romanesque doorway is placed off centre in this\nfacade ina manner which suggests that the door was positioned\nto be on the central axis of the chamber it gave access to. In\nother words, the pre-existing end wall of the arcade to the east\nformed the east wall of the chamber and so its thickness is not\nexpressed on the facade, while the west wall was newly built\nand its thickness accounts for the eccentricity of the facade.\n\nThe doorway is unusual but not unique in the architecture\nof Jerusalem. A very similar (but undated) doorway that existed\n—and may still exist — in the Old City in the vicinity of Bab al-\nSahira (Herod\'s Gate) is recorded in a photograph preserved in\nthe archives of the Palestine Archaeological (Rockefeller)\nMuseum (see plate 2.4). Both doorways have hoodmoulds\naround an outer arch of gadrooned voussoirs enclosing an\ninner chevron arch resting on elbow consoles (fig. 2.7). The\nentrance to the Kubakiyya (no. 6), dated c.688/1289, shares\nsome of these features. All three doorways represent a\ncontinuation of Crusader-Ayyubid architectural traditions as\nexemplified by the gadroon-arched entrances to the Church of\nthe Holy Sepulchre, the Sigaya of al-‘Adil and the Afdaliyya\nMadrasa (plates 2.5, 2.6 and 9). The Ayyubid and Mamluk\nexamples may incorporate re-used Crusader elements, but no\nreliable criterion has yet been recognized for differentiating\nbetween Crusader sculpture and later copies of it. At least the\n capitals of the elbow consoles at the Turba of Barka Khan,\nshown ina drawing by Pierotti of 1864 (plate 2.7) but no longer\nin situ, must be Crusader spolia.”\' A.G. Walls, who recorded the\nbuilding 1968-71, observed what he considered to be one of\nthe original capitals among a miscellaneous collection of\nworked stones in a corner of the courtyard.” The arrangement\nof the various components, such as the hoodmould that turns\noutwards above the springing level of the arches, appears,\nhowever, to be Mamlik. i\nThis entrance to the reading room was still open in 1900\nbut had been partly blocked up and converted into a window\nby 1920 (see plate 2.1) and we may surmise that this and other\nchanges took place shortly after the library was opened in 1900.\n (iv) Fourth phase\n\nThis involved the partial filling of the two archways\nimmediately to the east of the reading room to form a window\nin the western one and a portal and small water trough in the\neastern one. A two-line inscription above the window records\nthe event:\n\nThis window and the dome over the tomb (ézerba) of the\ndeceased prince Husam al-Din Barka Khan and the vault\n(qantara) and its upper floor (ahvahda/‘ulwaha) and the\nblessed portal (bawwdba) and the drinking trough\n(masqda) and the shops (hawdnit) and their upper floor\nand the five apartments (buyzit) in the waqf house (bi-dar\nal-wagf) were constructed (ansha’a) by ... Muhammad b.\nAhmad b. Timur (?) al“Ala’. . . at the beginning of Dha’ |-\nQa‘da 792 (11 October 1390).\n\nThe windows, portal and drinking trough are all that is\npositively recognizable of the things itemized in the\ninscription. Of the (rebuilt) dome over the turba nothing\nsurvives, and of the vault and its upper floor nothing is\nidentifiable except possibly four corbels above the portal. The\nshops and the five apartments are no longer identifiable.\n\nThe grilled window” bearing the inscription on its lintel is\nbuilt of red and cream-coloured ablaq masonry framed by a\nquirked ogee moulding (fig. 2.4). On either side of the\ninscription two marble plaques are carved with wane\nblazon-like devices which, according to M. Meinecke,” are\nprobably to be construed as s the tribal badge or renk of Barka\n\nOe Resin pe ag ISS a Rear, ae Ne BAER Bree eH GE TL pS\n representing a string course of joggled voussoirs, the central\none of which is more elaborately modelled than the others and\nis inscribed with the word ‘Allah’. Above the frame moulding, in\nthe tympanum of the earlier arch, there is a seven-line\ninscription, the historical part of which reads:\n\n_.. This is the tomb (trba) of .. . Barkat Khan, may God\nilluminate his grave (darih). He died on Friday 1\nMuharram 644 (18 May 1246)...\n\nThis inscription must belong to the original monument, having\nbeen removed to its present position presumably during the\nwork done in 792/1390. It is recessed 0.04m into the\nsurrounding masonry, which has been given a bevelled edge to\nframe the panel. The bevelling at the base of the panel, cut in\nthe top of the same stones as the quirked ogee moulding\nframing the grilled window, continues a little way on either\nside of the panel, as if the frame was intended for a wider\ninscription. In fact this bevelling is exactly the same width as the\ninscribed window lintel (1.25m), which suggests some sort of\nrelationship between the two, though what that relationship\nmight have been or been intended to be is not clear. Above the\nseven-line inscription is a circular oculus (now blocked) with a\nbevelled rim surrounded by an elegant border of finely carved\nolive or palm leaves.\n\nThe portal built into the earlier archway to the east of the\ngrilled window consists of a shallow recess, 0.35m deep,\nspanned by a pointed horseshoe arch. A cavetto hoodmould\naround the extrados of the arch extends laterally on both sides\nat the springing as far as the jambs of the earlier, enclosing\narchway. Little carved leaves similar to those in the border\nround the oculus decorate the corners of the hoodmould at the\nspringing and at downturns at either extremity (see fig. 2.4).\nThe voussoirs of the arch have been replaced at some time with\ncrudely worked stones now smeared with cement. The two\nspringers survive, however, to show that originally the arch was\ncomposed of gadroon voussoirs evidently in imitation of those\nof the Romanesque doorway. The door at the back of the recess\nhas jambs of red and cream-coloured ablag and is flanked by\nthe customary stone benches. Above the portal a rectangular\nwindow (now blocked) opened under the keystones of the\nenclosing archway.\n\nThe portal is placed left of centre in that archway to allow\nspace for a niche alongside, which houses the drinking trough\nmentioned in the inscription of 792/1390. Though badly\ndamaged, the pointed arch over the niche can be seen originally\nto have been gadrooned like that of the portal (see fig. 2.4). The\nstone trough in the lower part of the niche appears to have\nbeen filled by pouring water directly into it from the street; it\n has only a small drain hole (diameter 0.04m) at the bottom.\nThere is no trace of any water supply within the building\ncomplex.\n\nThe four roll corbels, whose introduction entailed\nremoval of a section of the cornice, are centred on the archway\nenclosing the portal and drinking trough. They were evidently\nintended to support a balcony or an oriel window like the one\nimmediately to the east of the portal, shown in plate 2.1, which\nwas demolished as recently as 1984. Anearly contemporaneous\noriel window survives at the Tashtamuriyya (no. 45) built in\n784/1382-83. These corbels are all that remain of what may have\nbeen the upper floor mentioned in the inscription of 792/1390.\nNo trace of a staircase exists.\n\nINTERIOR (plan, fig. 2.3)\nThe entrance portal described above is now the entrance to the\nlibrary. It leads into an open courtyard on two levels, one 0.23m\nhighér than the other. This courtyard occupies the space\nformerly occupied by two of the three shops behind the earlier\narchways. It is enclosed by relatively modern walls on three\nsides and by the street wall on the fourth, north side.\n\nThe east wall contains traces of a partition wall of the\nearlier shops at its north end; the remainder of the wall is later.\nAbout the centre is a door leading into the cross-vaulted room\n Plate 2.8 East side of courtyard\n\n‘A’, with a window on the right. Both door and window have\ndistinctive projecting surrounds (see plate 2.8), typically\nnineteenth-century Ottoman in style, which appear to have\nbeen added to earlier openings. The upper part of this east wall\nis of more regular masonry in which four identical windows\nopen, each with a projecting surround similar to those of the\ndoor and window below (plate 2.8) and all obviously late\nOttoman.\n\nThe south wall is quite plain apart from remains of\nmedieval masonry at the west end (plate 2.9), which must\nbelong to the earlier shops on the site.\n\nThe west wall contains a door and a window opening into\nthe reading room. Both openings have projecting frames like\nthose in the east wall but here with flat instead of segmental\narches (plate 2.3).\n\nThe present owners reported that the east and west walls\nof the reading room were rebuilt about 1876 for a family\nmosque.” The exterior masonry of the west wall (which forms\nthe frontage on ‘Aqabat Abt Madyan) is similar to that of the east\nwall. That part of the south wall of the reading room that\nconfronts ‘Aqabat Aba Madyan belongs to the same period of\nconstruction as the west wall (plate 2.1). Inside the reading\nroom a trefoil-arched mibrab in the middle of the south wall\n(see fig. 2.6) is a relic of this room’s adaptation as a mosque.\n\nBuilt into the outer face of the east wall of the reading\nroom are three inscriptions, epitaphs of Barka Khan and his\nsons.”’ These inscriptions must have been built into the wall at\nthe time of its construction, about 1876, or later. Two of them\nwere seen by Sandreczki in 1865 on the south and north sides,\nrespectively, of the courtyard (above, p. 110). Under each\ninscription there is a low stone platform (0.30m high) revetted\nwith plain nineteenth-century ceramic tiles. The middle\nplatform (2.30m long x 1.00m wide) abuts on the reading room\nwall. The other two are freestanding. The southern is 1.50m x\n0.90m and the northern 1.70m x 0.90m. They appear to be\ncenotaphs, each related to an epitaph in the wall. Presumably\nthey were built at the same time as the epitaphs were built into\nthe wall. An outline of vaults in the upper part of the wall seems\nto indicate that the courtyard was vaulted — or re-vaulted —\nwhen the wall was rebuilt around 1876. The vaulting did not last\nlong, however, for a photograph of about 1920 in the collection\nof the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem shows the\ncourtyard open to the sky.\n\nINTERPRETATION\n\nOf the phases of construction described above, it is the third\nand fourth — belonging to the Mamluk period — that concern us\nhere. The first of these, phase (iii), was built probably some\ntime after 663/1265 when a village that was endowed upon the\nturba was granted to the founder,” Badr al-Din Muhammad\nBey, son of Barka Khan, and before Badr al-Din’s burial in 679/\n1280. By analogy with the nearly contemporary Kubakiyya\n Turba we may reasonably assume that the Romanesque\ndoorway was the entrance to the original Turba, square in plan,\ncovered by a dome.\n\nAll three epitaphs state bluntly that ‘this is the grave (gabr)\nof...’ and it may be presumed that each originally marked a\ncenotaph of some kind in the tomb chamber, subsequently\nremoved from there before 1865 when Sandreczki saw two of\nthem in the courtyard. The inscription in the street facade\nabove the grilled window of the fourth phase, which includes\nthe words ‘this is the tomb (zrba) of . . . Barkat Khan’, was,\ntogether with the two plaques bearing his revk, doubtless set in\na prominent position; a possible place would have been over a\nwindow in the west facade which no longer survives.\n\nThe eastward extension, phase (iv), was made in 792/1390\nto create a new street facade roughly symmetrical about the\ncentral grilled window. Nothing is known about the amir\nresponsible for this work apart from his name: Muhammad b.\nAhmad b. Timur (?) al-‘Ala’I. What his intention might have\nbeen in restoring the dome of the turba and adding a new\nfacade is obscure; the area behind that new facade, the present\ncourtyard, may on the basis of Haram document no. 36 (cited\nabove) have been intended as a mosque, though in that case we\nshould have expected some mention of it in the inscriptions.\n LAPIDARY SHIELDS\n\nOf the six shields carved on two piers of the early archways\nincorporated into the complex in 792/1390, four have been\npartly defaced and none is cut with any great precision. But the\ndesign is clear: a T within a circle. Several analogous shields in\nthe form of an upside-down T enclosed by an isosceles triangle\nresting on its point (fig. 2.10) are to be found elsewhere in\nJerusalem: five, all much the same size and at roughly shoulder\nheight in the outer porch of Bab al-Silsila/Bab al-Sakina; two\nothers similar in size and height above ground at the entrance\nto the Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-Din (below, p. 126); another similar in\nsize and also at shoulder height on the street frontage of the Dar\nal-Qur’an al-Sallamiyya (below, p. 382): and one similar in shape\nbut very much larger on the southern abutment of an arch\nspanning the street immediately to the west of the Stq al-\nLahhamin,” one of the three parallel markets in the centre of\n the town. The date of none of the structures on which these\nshields are carved is known with precision. The tomb chamber\nof the Ribat is probably Ayyubid (below, p. 121), as is the porch\nat Bab al-Silsila, which is datable between 583/1187 and 595/\n1199-1200.*° The structure of the nearby Dar al-Qur’an and the\narch by the Siq al-Lahhamin may be Crusader and the arcade of\nthe Turba of Barka Khan is probably so (above, p. 111). All\nappear to have been built before the Mamluk period at least.\nThe shields are clearly not masons’ marks: they are too big\nand are found at shoulder height where they look as if they have\n 1 Mujir, ii, 45.\n\n2 CIA (Ville), no. 59.\n\n3 CIA (Ville), no. 60.\n\n4 CIA (Ville), no. 63.\n\n5 His father’s name is given in the biographical notice on his son, see Safadi,\nWafi, ii, 248.\n\n6 Ibn Wasil, Mufarrij, Cairo, 1972, iv, 325.\n\n7 Sultik, i, 280.\n\n8 Ibn Wasil, Mufarrij, Paris Ms. 1703, s.a. 644; Sibt b. al-Jawzi, Mir’at al-Zaman,\nHyderabad, 1952, viii, pt. ii, 760 and 764-5; Aba Shama, Dhayl, Cairo, 1947, 178;\nSafadi, Waft, x, 121.\n\n9 Mujir, ii, 45.\n\n10 Defter 602, 459.

There are few openings in the\nexternal (south) wall and the other boundaries are entirely\nenclosed by adjoining buildings. The only entrance to the\ncourtyard is placed more or less centrally in the street frontage.\nThat frontage shows four different styles of masonry. On\nthe right (east), the high wall of the tomb chamber is\nparticularly distinctive: it is built of roughly coursed stones,\nmost of which have a smooth margin drafted round an irregular\nboss (plate 3.1, in which the patches of whitish stone around\nthe door and lower window belong to repairs made in 1971).\nThe masonry of the entrance portal is dressed smooth except\nfor a recurrence of the bossed masonry of the tomb chamber in\nplaces immediately above the arched opening (plate 3.2). West\nof the entrance portal the wall is set back 0.82m. In this western\nsection of the frontage two types of masonry have been used:\n Te ee senate\n\nPlate 3. 3 Exterior of window in north wall of tomb chamber\n\nlarge, coursed ashlars in the lower part of the wall contrasting\nwith the smaller finely dressed coursed ashlars of the upper\npart, which extends over the ribat’s entrance to abut against the\ntomb chamber (fig. 3.4). These various masonry types indicate\nseveral stages in a complex sequence of construction.\n\nThe first clue to the interpretation of that sequence occurs\nin Mujir al-Din’s description of a later building, the Hasaniyya\nMadrasa, which he says is ‘at Bab al-Nazir, over the Ribat of ‘Ala’\nal-Din al-Basir . . . It was built in 837 (1434).\" Clearly the\nHasaniyya Madrasa is the building at first floor level extending\nwestwards from above the entrance of the ribat, as its\nsymmetrical fenestration and cavetto cornice indicate (fig. 3.4).\nThe entrance to this madrasa is situated beyond the western\nlimits of the ribat (below, p. 536).\n\nIn the lower part of the tomb chamber there is one large\nwindow through which the cenotaph over the tomb of the\nfounder may be seen, and, at the eastern extremity, a door\nleading into the tomb chamber. In addition to the window at\nstreet level three smaller clerestorey lights, with narrow slit\nwindows over the eastern and central ones (fig. 3.4), light the\ninterior. The distinctive bossed masonry extends to the full\nheight of the wall. Similar masonry occurs elsewhere in and\naround Jerusalem. It is common enough in the Crusader and\nAyyubid periods, particularly in fortifications, but is\nunrecorded in original Mamluk construction. This suggests that\nthe structure of the tomb chamber predates the construction of\nthe ribat. It is probably Ayyubid, for an arched window in its\nnorth wall (plate 3.3) is built from stones of different shapes\nand sizes bearing distinctive traces of Crusader workmanship\n(diagonal tooling and masons’ marks), which are obviously in\n re-use. The disposition of the smooth and bossed masonry\nshows what had happened. The tomb chamber predates the\nportal. In 666/1267-68 the portal was built against the tomb\nchamber (which did not house ‘Ala’ al-Din’s tomb until 693/\n1294, of course) by first dismantling part of the corner wall in\norder to key in the impost of the arch. The stones thus removed\nwere set aside, the portal constructed to the height of the\nkeystone of the arch, and then the removed stones were re-\nused to complete the construction of the upper part of the\nportal.\n\nThe entrance portal consists of a deep, vaulted porch\nflanked by stone benches (mastabas) before a small door\n(1.76m high by 0.91m wide) (plate 3.2). Above the door the\nlintel is decorated with a curious arrangement of bevelled\nchevron motifs framed by a raised band carved with a regular\npattern of continuous triangles. The fact that this raised band\ndoes not continue along the upper rim of the panel shows that\nthe stone has been re-used as a lintel. The style of its decoration\nis Ottoman and it appears to be a later insertion replacing the\noriginal lintel. A relieving lintel composed of two stones of\nequal sizes is carved with counterfeit voussoirs to suggest a flat\narch. Immediately above is the foundation inscription (above,\np.117) set back about 3cm from the face of the wall ina chamfer\nframe (plate 3.4, fig. 3.4).\n\nDetails of the construction of the vault of the porch show\nthat its original form has been altered. From the plan (the plan\nof the vault is shown as a broken line in fig. 3.3) it will be\nobserved that there are springers not only for the arch of the\npresent entrance but for another arch at right angles to it on the\nwest side of the porch. The original porch appears therefore to\nhave been open on two sides. Thus the mastaba on the west\nside of the porch is a later insertion and the pier at the south-\nwest corner, barely engaged into the adjoining masonry now,\nmust have been freestanding then. The chamfering (to reduce\nabrasion) of the three visible corners of the pier suggests as\nmuch — otherwise there could be no reason for chamfering the\nnorth-east corner. Were it possible to remove a small piece of\nthe masonry engaging the north-west corner of the pier we\nshould surely find that that corner is also chamfered.\n\nThus the lower part of the western wall of the street\nfrontage was constructed after the entrance to the ribat but\nsome time before the construction of the Hasaniyya Madrasa\nwhich it supports. Unfortunately, a small doorway in this wall is\nblocked (fig. 3.4) and so it is not possible now to view the\n western aspect of the unusually arranged entrance to the ribat.\n\nINTERIOR (plan, fig. 3.3)\n\nOn passing through the entrance door one enters a small\nintervenient yard which is open to the sky. The cross-vaulted\nchamber on the east side of this yard is of manifestly recent\nconstruction, as is the high wall on its north side, which may\nreasonably be ascribed to adaptations made for the nineteenth-\ncentury prison. On the other hand the wall on the west side,\nwhich skews north-east away from the entrance before\ncontinuing northwards, is not. The upper part of the wall,\nsupported by a half-arch (fig. 3.6), continues over the skew,\nwhich is simply cut out of the lower part of the wall. In other\nwords, part of the thick east wall of the vaulted halls was cut\naway to allow the entrance of the ribat to be placed as far as\npossible towards the centre of the north wall of the entrance\nporch. For this to have been necessary the halls must have been\nstanding before the porch was built (see below).\n\nAsmall door in the modern north wall of the intervenient\nyard opens north into the main courtyard. A wide, well-made\npointed-arched doorway immediately on the left leads into the\nfirst of the two vaulted halls, marked ‘A’ on the plan. The\nvaulting consists of two parallel north-south tunnel vaults\ninterconnected by two transverse vaults forming groins at the\nintersections and resting on a central pier (plate 3.5) and\nsalient responds in the north and south walls. A recess in the\nsouth wall may have originally contained a window that was\nblocked up when the later wall supporting the Hasaniyya\nMadrasa was added (above, p. 536). Apart from that there were\nno other windows; the present two high-level windows in the\nnorth wall are modern. This hall must be the ‘assembly hall’\nmentioned in the endowment deed recorded in the Tahrir\nregister no. 522 (see above, p. 117). In 1971 the hall was\nconsecrated as a mosque for the African community.” The\nevent is commemorated by an inscription in the entrance\nporch alongside the foundation inscription (plate 3.4). The\nmibrab of the mosque, a queer skeletal frame of stone (plate\n3.5), dates from this time; there is no evidence of any earlier\nmibrab within the confines of the ribat.\n\nIn the south-west corner of the courtyard a pointed-arched\ndoorway similar to that of the first vaulted hall opens into\nanother hall, marked ‘B’, which is roofed with a barrel vault and\nnow filled almost to the crown of the vault with debris. This\nsecond hall is structurally homogeneous with the first and must\n be contemporaneous with it. The masonry of their continuous\nnorth wall is very rough with no special features (plate 3.13). It\nhas been shown above to be pre-Mamlik, and to judge by its\npoor quality (apart from the door arches) it is probably Ayyubid\nrather than earlier. An excision in the western half of the vault\n (see plan, fig. 3.3) suggests that there may once have been an\nopening under it in the west wall but this is entirely concealed\nby debris. This hall must have been the ablutions place\nmentioned in the Tahrir register no. 522 (see above, p. 117).\n\nNo cisterns are now visible within the confines of the ribat,\nthough two are mentioned in the Tahrir register no. 522. One\nof them is indicated in the 1865 Ordnance Survey plan as being\nin the vicinity of the south-west corner of the courtyard.\n\nIn the south-east corner of the courtyard two small rooms,\nmarked ‘C’ and ‘D’ on the plan, occupy a salient filling the\ncorner. This salient is part of the same Ayyubid structure as the\ntomb chamber; it rises to the same height and shares the same\nbossed masonry (plate 3.6). Above rooms ‘C’ and ‘D’ there is a\nlarger room marked ‘E’ on the upper floor plan, fig. 35.4, which\nis reached by way of a staircase incorporated into the\nManjakiyya Madrasa (see below, no. 35).\n\nThe courtyard itself is crowded with such a jumble of\nmodern shanties that little can be seen of the lower west, north\nand east walls. The layout of the cells round the courtyard is\nshown on the ground floor plan. Each cell had a pointed-\n arched doorway (plate 3.7) and it is clear that they all form part\nof ‘Ala’ al-Din’s construction. The arrangement of the cells at\nthe north wall is very regular; each has a barrel vault spanning\nfrom east to west. (Many of the partition walls between these\ncells have been removed to create larger rooms more\nconvenient for domestic use.) In the east and west ranges of\ncells variations occur in the vaulting (see plan, fig. 3.3). On the\nwest side two cells have cross-vaults, two have barrel vaults\n spanning north — south, and one has a barrel vault spanning\neast — west. On the east side the barrel vaults span east — west\nand one cell has a curious extension that apparently goes\nbeyond the eastern limits of the site. These variations are\ndifficult to explain unless they were suggested to or imposed\nupon the builders of the ribat by the existence of some\nunidentified earlier structures around the site.\n\nThe buildings on the upper storeys at the north and east\n walls, and the heightening of the west wall (which has no\nbuildings at first floor level) are Ottoman. The east wall (plate\n3.8) in particular displays characteristic features of Ottoman\narchitecture in Jerusalem: round relieving arches in the\nmasonry above openings, paired windows and small star-\nshaped oculi over the mullions.\n\nTOMB CHAMBER\n\nThe street door is now the only entrance to the tomb chamber.\nIt is likely that there was originally an entrance from the\ncourtyard: the recess in the north wall of the chamber appears\nto be a door which was blocked, possibly at the time of ‘Ala’ al-\nDin’s burial in 693/1294, in order to isolate the tomb chamber\nfrom the ribat.\n\nInside, the tomb chamber appears disproportionately\nhigh since an intermediate floor that once divided it no longer\nsurvives. Vestiges of that former floor remain in the extra\nthickness of the lower north, east and west walls (plates 3.9 and\n3.10) and in the outline of a vault at the west end of the chamber\n(plate 3.10). The floor collapsed in the earthquake of Dhw\'l-\nQa‘da 952/January 1546, according to a docket in the Shari\'a\nCourt archives (see above, p. 119), and was not rebuilt. A\nblocked doorway in the upper part of the north wall (marked\n‘d on the upper floor plan, fig. 35.4) originally gave access to\nthat floor from the adjoining room ‘E’ (see above). At the same\nlevel there are several other openings: two windows west of the\nblocked door on the north side, of which one is blocked and\nthe other set in a curious arched recess like a doorway (plate\n3.3) with a projecting sill decorated with re-used Crusader\nmouldings; three windows in the south side of the tomb\nchamber overlooking the street, two of which are surmounted\nby slits (see above, p. 121); a high level slit window (now\nblocked) in the east wall; and an opening to the west (plate\n 3.10) over the entrance portal, blocked by the Hasaniyya\nMadrasa which abuts against it.\n\nThe vaulting of the chamber is unusual. Three cross vaults\nseparated by transverse arches spring from tall abutments\nagainst the north and south walls. Those against the north wall\nbear on a ledge formed by the broadening of the lower wall\noriginally intended to help support the intermediate floor. The\nabutments against the south wall extend to floor level. Though\nthe masonry of these abutments is not continuous with that of\nthe walls, the manner in which they are engaged by the lower\n 1 Mujir, ii, 43.\n\n2 CIA (Ville), no. 64.\n\n3 Mujir, ii, 43.\n\n4 For his biography, see W4fi, ix, 485, on which is based Manhal, Cairo Ms.\nTa’rikb 1113, i, fols. 285b-286a (see Wiet, Manhal, no. 589); al-Suqat, Talz, 15,\nno. 22.\n\n5 Wafi, loc. cit.\n\n6 Muir, ii, 270-1.\n\n7 Mujir ii, 31.\n\n8 Sulitk, i, 560.\n\n9 Wafi, loc. cit.\n\n10 Mujir, ii, 271.\n\n11 Sijill 6, no. 1931.\n\n12 Ipsirli, 21 & 165, and see also Asali, Ma hid, 316-7.

By 944/1537 ‘Ala’ al-Din\nhad become referred to as ‘wali Allah’ or ‘al-shaykh’ (see above,\np. 119).

These components of the ribat\nfrontage are not on the same alignment, with the entrance bay\nprojecting 0.45m from the wall to the west and 1.11m from the\nwall to the east.\n\nThe manner in which the masonry of the eastern facade is\nkeyed into the adjoining masonry to the east of it (visible in\nplate 5.1) shows that the latter precedes the former. That earlier\nstructure, which continues eastwards as far as the outer porch\nat the Bab al-Nazir, is probably Ayyubid: incorporated into its\n street wall are several Crusader stones along with four\nfragments of two Arabic inscriptions dated by van Berchem to\nthe founivicn or fifth/eleventh century,” all obviously in re-\nuse.\n\nAtabend in the street alignment towards the middle of the\nwall to the west of the entrance bay, traces of a vertical cyma\nmoulding (plate 5.2) may indicate that there once existed a\nportal at this point (marked ‘p’ on the plan, fig. 5.3). The profile\nof the moulding appears to be Crusader and this, together with\nthe change of alignment and increased thickness (see fig. 5.3),\nsuggest that the wall to the west of the vertical moulding is of\nCrusader construction. Indeed, according to Mujir al-Din, two\nlater foundations, the Yanusiyya (date unknown) and the\nTaharkasivva Madrasa (before 791/1339), apparently just to the\n esses yaebete, ~ pate\n\nwest of the Mansuri Ribat on the south side of Tariq Bab al-\nNazir, occupied a church of which this wall may be a vestige.?”\nTherefore it would appear that the street frontage of the\nManstri Ribat was erected between the remains of earlier\nstructures, one Ayyubid and one presumably Crusader, the\nformer to the east and the latter to the west.\n\nThe decoration of the facade to the east of the entrance bay\n(plate 5.1) incorporates certain elements that may originally\nhave belonged to a Crusader church. The marble impost\nmouldings of the two pointed-arched window recesses are\ntypically Crusader, though the red and cream-coloured ablaq\nmasonry of the recesses is obviously Mamltk. The corbel table\nmust have formed a cornice over the eastern part of the street\nfacade before the later addition of an upper storey. It is\ncuriously composed of a series of twenty consoles with little\nfluted and scalloped conchs spanning between them. This is\nthe only instance in Jerusalem of a corbel table composed of\nthese two features. There are, however, several Crusader\nexamples of analogous corbel tables resting on elaborately\nprofiled consoles but without the conchs, and this may indicate\nthat the consoles are here in secondary use. Fluted and\nscalloped conchs are relatively common in Ayyubid and\nMamlak architecture and here they appear to be the work of the\nMamluk builders of the ribat\n\nThe entrance* (plate 5.3) is distinctive: the ablag frontal\narch, composed of red and cream-coloured voussoirs resting\non deeply moulded marble imposts (possibly Crusader spoils),\nopens into a very large (5.23m wide and 7.66m deep) cross-\nvaulted porch. This type of monumental porch was common in\nJerusalem from the Ayyubid period until the arrival of the\n‘stalactite portal’ in 695/1295 (see below, p. 157). The Salahiyya\nKhanqah (waqf 585/1189), the Siqaya of al-‘Adil (589/1193), and\nthe Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-Din (666/1267-68) each have comparable\ncross-vaulted entrance bays; the Ayyubid porch at the Bab Hitta\n(see above, p. 49) is likewise cross-vaulted.\n\nUPPER FAGADE\n\nThe upper facade belongs to a later building. The original\nchevron-arched entrance doorway (plate 5.4) to that later\nbuilding is at first floor level and was reached by a double\nstaircase with flights leading from east and west against the\nstreet frontage of the ribat, shown on the 1865 Ordnance\nSurvey plan of the Haram and its environs.*! That staircase has\ndisappeared, rendering the doorway inaccessible; it has been\nmade into a window. Since Mujir al-Din lists no Mamluk\n foundation over the Mansiri Ribat, we may assume that this\nbuilding was erected after the time of his writing, 901/1496.\nAlthough the exact date of construction is unknown, it is\ntempting to ascribe this building to the middle of the tenth/\nsixteenth century on the analogy of the chevron arches on three\nof Sultan Sulayman’s sabils built in the fashion of portals and\ndated 943/1536-37,° along with that of the entrance to the\nMaktab of Bayram Jawish (947/1540-41).*°\n\nINTERIOR (plan, fig. 5.3)\n\nThe street now runs at a level higher than that of the pavement\nof the entrance porch but this is likely to be the result of\nresurfacing; the original street level was surely somewhat\nlower. The stone pavement of the porch is mostly original,\nincorporating several re-used flagstones with characteristic\nstriations similar to those at the so-called Lithostron in the\nConvent of the Sisters of Zion, which are said to be Hadrianic.*”\nThere are plain stone benches on either side of the porch,\nwhich return for a short distance on each side of the main\nentrance doorway in the rear (south) wall. Two other doorways\nopen off the porch, one in the east wall opening into the main\n i paseo Sn i arc ers EPR ag Sah DR eae at tis a ae aaa gee Ue 1s UO eS RBCS -) me mR eS Or Cas Sot EP a I OLA\n\nhall and one in the west wall opening into a cell at the north-\neast corner of the courtyard (plate 5.5). The benches have been\nlowered to form a step up to each of the doorways, which\nsuggests that the doorways are not original. Segmental arches —\na typically Ottoman feature — over the western doorway and\nover the window above the eastern doorway (see fig. 5.5)\nfurther suggest that the two doorways are later insertions.\n\nThe main entrance doorway has a monolithic lintel\nsurmounted by an ablag relieving arch and the foundation\ninscription (see fig. 5.4). The doorway leads into the entrance\nvestibule; to the left (east) is the main hall and to the right\n(west) the courtyard. In front (south) two archways open on the\nwestern extension of the main hall. The floor of the main hall\nand its extension is almost 0.50m higher than that of the\nvestibule.\n\nThe vaulting of the main hall is divided into eight cross-\nvaulted bays separated by transverse arches resting on a central\nrow of four pillars (plate 5.6). The use of pillars in the primary\nstructural fabric —as distinct from decorative embellishments —\nis extremely rare in the Mamlik architecture of Jerusalem.\nTheir presence here led Clermont-Ganneau ** to suggest that\nthis hall was originally part of the Church of St. Michael, on the\nassumption that, since the gate Bab al-Nazir is said by Mujir al-\nDin® to have been known formerly as the Bab Mika’il, the Gate\nof Michael, its name was derived from a church which Mujir al-\nDin locates in this area (above, p. 133). The facade of the main\nhall, though it incorporates Crusader elements, is obviously\nMamluk. As for the internal structure of the hall, this too seems\nto be an original Mamlik construction. In the opinion of the\nlate Pere Charles Coiiasnon OP and of Professor Jaroslav Folda,\ntwo noted experts in the field of Crusader architecture who\nkindly examined this hall with me, the curious capitals on the\npillars are not Crusader and may well be Mamlik.*®° The capitals\nare very plain. The northern one differs in detail from the other\nthree, but all are essentially of the same type. The capitals of the\nthree pillars of the western extension of the main hall (plate\n5.7) are similar to those shown in fig. 5.8, albeit somewhat\nsmaller.\n\nIf the decorative features of the main hall indicate that it is\nan original Mamluk construction, the variations in level and the\nawkward plan suggest that not only was the street frontage\nrestricted by pre-existing structures to the east and west but that\nthe complex was bounded in part at least by other structures on\nthe south side.\n The courtyard is extremely large (approx. 28m x 23m).\nThe pointed-arched doors to the cells around the courtyard are\narranged more or less regularly, each surmounted by a tall\nnarrow opening for light and ventilation (see plates 5.8 and\n5.9). The interior layout of the cells is far from regular,\nhowever, doubtless as a result of the irregular boundary of the\npre-existing structures bordering the site. In one of the cells on\nthe south side of the courtyard the rear wall has been breached\n to link that cell with a large cross-vaulted room built against it.\nThe rear wall of the cells at the west side of the courtyard is,\nunlike the other boundaries, quite straight and was pierced at\nintervals by high-level windows (now blocked). This seems to\nindicate that the wall was built anew as the western boundary of\nthe ribat. In a cell at the south-west corner, this wall has been\nbreached to link the ribat with the area to the west where, if our\ninterpretation of Mujir al-Din’s text is correct, are to be found\nthe Yunusiyya and Jaharkasiyya Madrasa.\n Two cisterns in the courtyard, marked 22 feet deep and\n10% feet deep on the 1865 Ordnance Survey plan, are now\nhidden under the modern shanties. The cistern head shown in\nsection on fig. 5.6 is a reconstruction based on Creswell’s\nphotographs (plates 5.8 and 5.9) together with fragments of it\nfound on the roof of the tzerba in 1979.\n\nThe fine pavement of the courtyard, still largely intact in\n1920 (see plates 5.8 and 5.9), was finally destroyed when new\ndrains were laid in 1980 (see plate 5.10).\n\nTURBA\n\nIn one of the cells on the north side of the courtyard there is an\nanepigraphic cenotaph (plate 5.11). This must be the turba\nwhich Mujir al-Din describes as being opposite the Hasaniyya\nMadrasa (no. 55); he adds es it is said that it is the grave of\nSayyida Fatima bint Mu’ awiya’\"\' without giving further details of\nthis female’s identity.\n\nThe cell containing this cenotaph lies just to the west of the\nmoulding in the street wall, which appears to be Crusader as\nmentioned above. It is certainly pre-Mamlik. The alignment of\nthe turba and of the adjoining cell to the east and the two cells\nto the west is quite different from that of the other cells around\nthe courtyard (see plan, fig. 5.3). This different alignment\nshows that all four cells at the west end of the north side of the\ncourtyard belong to an earlier construction.\n\nThe vaulting pattern of the two cells flanking the turba\nreveals that originally there were no partition walls such as now\nseparate them from the turba, while the unusual vaulting of the\nturba (see section, fig. 5.6) shows that it was originally covered\nby a dome, replaced at some later date by the present cross\nvault. The four wall arches of the turba are shaped to form the\nextremities of corner pendentives (plate 5.12) in a very\ndistinctive manner which is encountered only in Crusader\narchitecture, except for one occurrence in an Islamic building,\nat the Awhadiyya (no. 9), the dome of which is discussed below,\np.174. The walls and ceiling of the turba are entirely covered\nwith plaster and so it is not possible to check whether the\nstonework of the wall arches bears masons’ marks or other\nsigns of Crusader workmanship. Several stones in the north,\nwest and south walls of the courtyard do, however, bear\nmasons’ marks and therefore it seems likely that they were\ntaken from some Crusader structure of which the present turba\nonce formed a part. The grave of Fatima bint Mu\'awiya was\npresumably installed under this domed structure just as the\ngrave of the Ayytbid ‘Shaykh Darbas’ was placed under the\ndome of a Crusader chapel in the Jawiliyya complex (see\nbelow, p. 205).\n\nWhen the turba and its associated structures were\nincorporated into the ribat, their south walls were refaced to\nadjust their alignment to match that of the other, newly built\ncells on the north side of the courtyard.\n\nBUILDING TEAM\n\nAt Hebron there was a corbel table composed of fluted conchs\non consoles — the only example known to us that is similar to\nthe corbel table over the eastern facade of the Mansiri Ribat.\nThe example in Hebron was situated above the (anepigraphic)\nentrance to the stairs leading to the Siqaya of Qalawiin, dated\n679/1280-81 (plate 5.13). Unfortunately, that entrance was\ndemolished ia the 1960s but to judge from the published\nphotographs® it was similar in style to the entrance to the\nMansuri Ribat and probably dates from the period of Qalawin’s\nrestoration of the Haram in Hebron in 679/1280-81. Qalawiin’s\nribat in Hebron was built in the same year, but it too has\ndisappeared. Creswell records that its cross-vaulted entrance\nbay (plate 5.14) bore a striking resemblance to that of the\nMansuri Ribat in Jerusalem. Moreover, the Superintendent of\nthe Two Harams, ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir, who almost certainly\nsuperintended the construction of the Mansiri Ribat in\nJerusalem (above, p. 79), was probably also responsible for\nsuperintending the building works of Qalawun in Hebron.‘\n These connections strongly suggest that the builders of\nQalawin’s ribat and siqaya in Hebron were also responsible,\nunder the superintendence of ‘Ala’ al-Din, for Qalawin’s ribat\n in Jerusalem. The fact that the texts of the foundation\ninscriptions of the two ribats are almost identical in content and\nepigraphic style supports this hypothesis.*°\n 33 Many French early Romanesque prototypes exist, at Poiton for example (see,\neg., A Borg, Architectural Sculpture in Romanesque Provence, Oxford, 1972,\npassim).\n\n34 C.

Sauvaire, Histoire de Jérusalem et d’Hébron, Paris,\n1876, 263 n. 2). The mathara must be the sigéya of Qalawiin, just as the mathara\nin Jerusalem is (a development of) the sigaya of al-‘Adil which was restored by\n‘Ala’ al-Din in 665/1267 (CIA (Ville), 104-5) for Qalawan and which, in a receipt\ndated 707/108, is referred to as the Siqaya al-Mansiriyya (Linda S. Northrup and\nAmal Abul-Hajj, ‘A Collection of Medieval Arabic Documents in the Islamic\nMuseum at the Haram al-Sarif, Arabica, xxv, 1978, 288).\n\n46 The text of the foundation inscription of the ribat and a masqaya in Hebron\nis given by J.-A. Jaussen, ‘Inscriptions arabes de la ville d’Hébron’, B/FAO, xxv,\n1925, 25-26. According to Jaussen the ribat in Hebron continued to furnish\npilerims with food and lodging in his dav (1925). It was demolished in the 1960s.\n ','STREET FRONTAGE, UPPER FAGADE, INTERIOR, TURBA, BUILDING TEAM'),(6,'EXTERIOR (figs. 6.3-6.6)\n\nThe lowest visible course of masonry projects outwards about\n0.05m to form a plinth on which the walls were erected. Seven\ncourses above that plinth the walls step back a further 0.03m\nbefore rising four more courses to complete the cubic case\n(plate 6.1). Much of this masonry is re-used: many of the stones,\nespecially in the south-east side, bear the marks of Crusader\ntooling and several have masons’ marks. The west corner of the\nbuilding (plate 6.2) was quite dilapidated before 1874 when\nClermont-Ganneau made a drawing of it. 7 Tt was subsequently\nrepaired, as noticed by Schick in 1894.\n The cylindrical drum is built of four courses of ashlars. The\nupper course contains a series of brackets that support a\nprojecting cavetto cornice at the base of the dome. These\nbrackets are of the two main types (though there are variations)\narranged more or less alternately around the drum (plate 6.3).?\nSimilar bracketed cornices are a fairly common feature in\nCrusader architecture,!° and continued to be used in the\nAyyubid period.’ This is the only known Mamlik instance,\napparently composed of re-used Crusader elements.\n\nThe ashlar dome is raised on a base course with a bevelled\ntop edge that forms an angled step about 0.03m wide (see plate\n6.1). The apex of the dome is fitted with a stone finial.\n\nThe windows in the north-east, south-east and south-west\nwalls are all identical, each having a monolithic lintel (which\ndoes not course through with the mural masonry) surmounted\nby an arcuated relieving lintel carved to simulate an arch of\nsimply joggled voussoirs, a relatively common device in the\nsecond half of the seventh/thirteenth century.”\n\nThe entrance in the centre of the north-west side is set in\na recess spanned by a pointed and horseshoed trefoil arch\n(plate 6.4).° On either side of the recess re-used Crusader\nelbow consoles of different sizes support a deeply modelled\narchivolt, probably composed of re-used voussoirs from a\nCrusader building. A hoodmould with short lateral extensions\nruns around the extrados of the arch; it is carved with a nail-\nhead pattern on the outer register and intricate diaperwork of\nintersecting circles and semicircles on the inner register.\n\nPlain stone benches flank the entrance door. The door\njambs are lightly carved with a delicate roll moulding. Above\nthe monolithic door lintel an arcuated relieving lintel has\ncounterfeit voussoirs similar to those over the window lintels.\nThe dedicatory inscription is placed one course above the\nrelieving lintel.\n\nINTERIOR (plan, fig. 6.2; sections, figs. 6.7—6.9)\n\nThe entrance door, open until 1975, has been crudely blocked\nup and cemented over. It led directly into the tomb, which is lit\nby the windows in the other three walls. Two recesses on either\nside of the door echo the two window embrasures in the\nOpposite wall. The walls are plastered up to the level of the\nzone of transition except for a panel of exposed ashlars\nbetween the two windows in the south-east wall. This panel\ncontains the plain pointed-arched mihbrab, which is\nsemicircular in plan (see fig. 6.2).\n\nThe transition from square base to circular drum is\neffected in two stages not expressed on the exterior other than\nby the stepping back of the walls at a level which coincides with\nthe base of the zone of transition. The first stage of transition is\nfrom square to octagon by means of duplex corner arches, one\narch inside the other, with mugarnas niches cut into the\nspringers and little fluted conchs set into the corners (see figs.\n6.7-6.9; plate 6.5). This stage culminates in a cavetto cornice.\nThe transition from the octagonal cornice to the circular drum\nis made simply by eight fluted conchs acting like miniature\n Squinches above the corners of the octagon. Another cavetto\ncornice defines the conjunction between drum and dome.\n\nIn the middle of the paved stone floor the stone cenotaph\nis oriented in the usual Muslim manner with its long axis\nparallel to the qibla wall. It is a curious object, unparalleled in\nIslamic architecture, and said to be Crusader work of the\neleventh or twelfth century.“ It has a curved gable-ended lid\nwith a ridge running along the full length and a deep bevelled\nflange over the base, which has five blind arches in each side\nand two in each end, and sits on a bevelled plinth (plate 6.6).\nThe blind arches at each end of the sides are decorated with\ndiaperwork similar to that on the hoodmould of the archivolt,\nwhich may indicate a common soutce.\n 1 At the time of van Berchem’s visit (1914) the building was known locally as\n‘Qubbat al-‘Abed’ (C/A (Ville), 203 n. 3).\n\n2 The exact orientation has unfortunately not been checked. The orientations\nshown on modern maps are not consistent. Van Berchem remembered the gibla\nwall as facing south-south-east (CIA (Ville), 203 n. 4), while Walls’s drawings show\nthe gibla wall facing almost directly south-east.\n\n3 Discussed by Clermont-Ganneau, Archaeological Researches in Palestine\nduring the years 1873-1874, i, London, 1899, 279-90.\n\n4 CIA (Ville), 203-10.\n\n5 Mujir, 414.\n\n6 Al-Nuwayri, Mufaddal, Ibn Habib, al-Magqrizi, and Ibn Taghribirdi, all cited in\nCIA (Ville), 210 n. 1.\n\n7 C.

They must have been replaced in the repairs mentioned by\nSchick, and these repairs may have disturbed the original sequence of the\nbrackets.\n\n10 Van Berchem (CIA (Ville), 208 n. 1) gives a list of Crusader examples.\n\n11 At the Qubbat al-Nahwiyya, for example, constructed in 604/1207-8.\n\n12 This device is found over the entrance door lintels of the Turba of Barka Khan\n(no. 2), the Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-Din (no. 3) and the Mansuri Ribat (no. 5).\n\n13 On the evolution of the trefoil arch see: M.

A\nsolitary grilled window in the Haram wall, which, as al-Umari\nobserved, once opened to the tomb chamber, is now blocked.\nThe dome over the tomb chamber rises above the roof of the\nportico but is set so far back as to have been visible only from\nafar. Later Ottoman apartments ranged in front of the dome\nnow obscure it from view.\n\nSTREET FACADE (fig. 9.6)\n\nThis facade, extending from the tomb chamber across the\nwidth of the eastern courtyard to the entrance portal, was\nclearly intended as the principal facade. It contains two\nhandsome windows both of which are now blocked, The\nfacade is crowned by a cornice moulding which rises above the\nentrance portal in the beginnings of a pish-taq. The upper part\nof the pish-taq has been dismantled and an Ottoman\nconstruction now sits over the doorway. The northern extent of\nthe facade can be determined from the definite termination of\nthe cornice. To the north the disposition of the masonry (see\nJig. 9.6) shows that the adjoining wall stood toa height of 4.30m\nbefore the Awhadiyya was built. There are several stones\n bearing Crusader masons’ marks in that adjoining wall but\nsince they are obviously in secondary use the wall must be later,\nprobably Ayyubid.\n\nAn even earlier building seems once to have occupied part\nof the site, for remains of a single course of stones project into\nthe street following a different alignment from the present\nbuildings. The southernmost vestige of this course of stones\nwas until 1981 used as a step at the main entrance to the\nAwhadiyya.”?\n\nAt the southern end of the street the window of the tomb\nchamber is in an infill wall built into the western arch of the\nearlier northern porch of Bab Hitta where passers-by entering\nand leaving the Haram could look in at the grave of the founder.\nThe window in the middle of the facade opens, most unusually,\nto the eastern courtyard. It is hard to imagine what purpose this\nwindow might have served. Since the courtyard is open to the\nsky, it was not needed for lighting. It cannot have been\nintroduced simply to enliven an otherwise blank stretch of\nmasonry because Mamluk masons were not afraid to leave\nlarge expanses of wall undecorated. The most likely purpose of\nthe window, which is almost identical in form with that of the\ntomb chamber, was to be a visual reminder to passers-by of the\nassociation of the main complex with the tomb of the founder,\nof which the window, beneath the earlier gate porch, might\notherwise have appeared separated from the rest of the facade\nincluding the entrance portal.\n\nBoth windows are similarly set in shallow recesses with\npointed arches resting on re-used marble imposts of Crusader\nworkmanship (see fig. 10c). The jambs, lintels and sills are\nsolid blocks of veined white marble. (A row of stone corbels\n beside the left-hand impost of the courtyard window (see fig.\n9.6) is a later insertion. )\n\nAbove the lintel of the courtyard window there is a\nrectangular stone panel carved in light relief. The main features\nof the carved design (plate 9.1) are two decorative medallions\ninterconnected by a circular link. The scheme of the right-hand\nmedallion consists of a ten-pointed star interwoven with a\ncurvilinear ten-pointed blunt star round a central rosette\ncomposed of four heart-shaped leaves. The scheme of the left-\nhand medallion consists of two overlapping and interlocking\nrectilinear nine-pointed stars round a curious ‘flying bird’ motif\n(see below). The background of the panel is filled with an\nintricate arabesque of foliate scrolls and palmettes.\n ENTRANCE (plate 9.2)\n\nThe entrance doorway is set at the back of a deep recess flanked\nby the customary stone benches. Crusader marble columns are\nre-used for nook-shafts to articulate the outer corners of the\nentrance bay. The bay is roofed by a cloister vault (plate 9.3).\nThe peripheral stones of the vault form in the vertical plane the\nalternately split voussoirs of the frontal arch. The voussoirs are\nbisected in such a way that each stone weighs about as much as\nits neighbour, i.e. the split voussoirs, half as thick as the whole\nones, penetrate twice as far back into the vault (plate 9.3). The\nvault springs from a re-used marble impost with the same\nprofile as the impost of the courtyard window (fig. 10c),and the\nstonework radiates from a central hub; the radial joints are\nchamfered for emphasis. That central hub (plate 9.4) is inlaid\nwith black bituminous limestone to form an unusual blazon-\nlike device (see below). Larger versions of the same design are\ninlaid in the side walls of the recess alongside the capitals of the\n\ncorner columns where they would be easily seen from the\nstreet.\n THE ‘BLAZONS’ (fig. 9.8)\n\nEach of these devices consists of an ornamental circular shield.\nThe sides of the shield develop inwards to form demi-\npalmettes while a central stem rises behind a crescent and then\nswells into a curious bulbous element, the upper tip of which\n breaks through the shield. At the base the stem breaks through\nthe shield to form a swag.\n\nThis device represents an interesting development in the\nuse of heraldic motifs. It appears to belong to a series of\ninsecurely dated devices based on the heraldic fleur-de-lis. The\nfirst of these (fig. 9.9) consists of fleurs-de-lis alternating with\neight-petalled rosettes on mugarnas capitals re-used as\ncolumn bases in the minbar (rebuilt in 1375/1955-56) of the\n Great Mosque of Homs built by Nur al-Din Zangi (reigned 541/\n1146-569/1174). L.A. Mayer in his great corpus of Saracenic\nheraldry\" ascribes this capital to Nir al-Din but M. Meinecke\nhas recently suggested\" that it ought to be dated later, probably\nafter 671/1272-73. Meinecke’s dating seems more likely but\nsince the fleur-de-lis, occasionally in conjunction with other\nroyal, heraldic or pseudo-heraldic emblems, remained in use\nwell into the eight/fourteenth century” it is impossible to date\n this example with any precision. The second is a fleur-de-lis in\na circular shield carved in stucco (fig. 9.10) in the Maristan of\nNar al-Din in Damascus (built 549/1154). It was also dated by\nMayer to the time of Nur al-Din but is now more securely dated\nby Meinecke™ to Sultan Qalawiin’s restorations there in 682/\n1283. This fleur-de-lis has a swag base similar to that of the\nAwhadiyya ‘blazons’ but is contained within the circular shield.\nThe third is a fleur-de-lis in a circular shield flanked by two\naffronted feline animals in circular shields (fig. 9.11) on an\nunidentified building at al-Salahiyya near Damascus.’’ Here the\nfleur-de-lis has a cup-like base and there are demi-palmettes\nsprouting from the circumference of the encircling shield in a\nmanner analogous to the Awhadiyya ‘blazons’. The Awhadiyya\nblazons seem to display a development of this form whereby\nthe two outer leaves of the emblem are adjoined as demi-\npalmettes to the circumference of the shield leaving only an\nelaborated central leaf with a swag base and a crescent around\nthe stem. The crescent is not an uncommon element in Mamltk\nart\'® and is often used in conjunction with other devices.’ It\nappears here to be an adaptation of the more usual cross-bar\nfound in fleurs-de-lis, designed to fill the space in the lower\npart ofthe shield. A later stage in this evolution is to be foundalso\nin Jerusalem at the Jaliqiyya Turba (no. 11) where the ‘fleur-de-\nlis’ in a foundation inscription dated 707/1307 still has the swag\nbase but has developed no less than eleven leaves (fig. 9.12).\n\nThus it would appear that these ‘blazons’ at the Awhadiyya\nwere most likely inspired by heraldic emblems but that the\ndesigner was perhaps making use of the technical heraldic\nvocabulary of his day for symbolic or ornamental, not heraldic\npurposes.\n\nTHE FLYING BIRD’ (fig. 9.13)\n\nThis may be a similar sort of hybrid. It is the only known\nexample of representational carving from the Mamluk period\nin Jerusalem.”! The body of the bird follows a formalized type\ncommonly given to standing eagles in Mamlik heraldry and\ndecoration. The eight-petalled rosette in the middle of the\ncomposition may have some heraldic association though this is\nnot certain.” Eagles with one or two heads in combination with\nanother heraldic emblem are found in Mamlik heraldry from\nthe end of the seven/thirteenth century,” but never is one\nemblem charged with the other. Even more unusual is the\nhorizontal posture of the bird —as if it were in flight —and its\ncuriously naturalistic head surrounded by a halo.”4 The small\n aprane Soierentin Sa oe Tae eA Eiicn nating Ta eel a Sa ash Cc ateet ak pear mE os LN eA gts WP 4 /ie a\n\nsize of this motif (0.12m diameter) and its sketchy carving make\nit scarcely noticeable in a large panel of elaborately carved\ndecoration. This seems to indicate that it was not intended to be\nread as a blazon; if it were, the presence of the blazon-like\nshields at the entrance portal would be utterly confusing.\n\nINTERIOR\n@ Ground floor (plan, fig. 9.3; axonometric, fig. 9.7)\nThe entrance doorway leads into a cross-vaulted vestibule,\nalmost square in plan. A wide stone bench against the back\n(west) wall narrows in returning along the north wall. The\nentrance into the courtyard is in the south wall of the vestibule,\nso that there is no clear view of the interior here from the street.\nThe four walls of the eastern courtyard (plate 9.14) are\ncrowned at a uniform height by a continuous cornice\nmoulding. Only along the south side, the north wall of the tomb\nchamber and of an upper room adjoining it are built above the\nmoulding (plate 9.5, fig. 9.7).\nUnderneath a remarkable porch incorporating two fe-\n atts Setter teary th Wort tenats od i rm brant SA fot\n\nused Crusader columns (plate 9.6) in the south-west corner of\nthe courtyard three steps lead up to the doorway of the\nantechamber to the tomb chamber. The tomb chamber was\noriginally entered by passing under a transverse arch spanning\nbetween two more re-used Crusader columns (plate 9.7). A\nmodern partition wall has been erected to seal off the tomb\nchamber which is now quite inaccessible. Only by peering in\nthrough a narrow, splayed window high in its north wall\n (visible in plate 9.5) can a view of the darkened chamber be\nobtained. Through the same window a camera and flashlight\ncan be introduced and photographs give a reasonably clear\nimpression of the interior (plates 9.8 and 9.9).\n\nThe lower walls of the tomb chamber are plastered,\nPointed wall arches and ashlar pendentives support a smooth\nashlar drum and dome. The curve of the pendentives begins in\nthe voussoirs of the four supporting arches, giving each\nvoussoir a compound curve on its face. No two voussoirs of any\none arch are the same. This distinctive form of pendentive\nconstruction, otherwise unknown in the Islamic architecture of\nJerusalem, is usual in Crusader domes in Jerusalem, from\nwhich the builders seem most likely to have drawn their\ninspiration. Here, however, the pendentives, rather than\nterminating at the level of the apexes of the keystones of the\nsupporting arches as is usual in Crusader domes, terminate at\nthe level of the base of the keystones. From this level upwards\nthe cylindrical shape of the lower part of the drum, or ‘sub-\ndrum’, is already defined (plate 9.9). Besides cutting across the\nkeystones, this sub-drum also cuts across the uppermost\nvoussoirs of the arches, which are accordingly cut into\nextraordinary shapes, the faces of each voussoir defining two\ndifferent intersecting curved planes. The whole zone of\ntransition gives an impression, false of course, of having been\nsomehow hewn from a solid mass of masonry. As in Crusader\ndomes, a cavetto moulding above the sub-drum marks the base\nof the drum proper. The drum is decorated with twelve slightly\npointed arches; the four over the pendentives are windows\n(now blocked) and the others are shallow, concave, blind\nniches. Another cavetto moulding separates the drum from the\nashlar dome.\n\nA deep recess in the south (Haram) wall of the tomb\nchamber opens under a semicircular arch with distinctive 45°\nchamfering of the lower edge of the voussoirs similar to that\nfound on several Haram gates, including the adjoining Bab\nHitta which we consider to be Umayyad. This raises the\npossibility that the present Bab Hitta is but one bay of a double\ngateway of which this recess was the western bay. A vertical\njoint in the masonry of the Haram wall (marked ‘j’ on the plan,\n\nfig. 9.3) about 1.20m west of the opening of the Bab Hitta\nstrengthens this possibility (although there is no joint visible at\nthe point corresponding to the west jamb of this possible\ngateway).\n\nA wooden screen with remains of a quirked ogee cresting\n(plate 9.8), perhaps original, closes most of the lower part of\nthe recess. Of the mibrab mentioned in the eighteenth-century\ndocket referred to above (p. 167) the only possible trace is a\ncrack in the plaster on the south wall of the recess beside the\nwindow (now blocked) that once opened under the Haram\nportico.\n\nAt the north-west corner of the eastern courtyard a\ncorridor connects with the courtyard of an earlier adjoining\nhouse to the north (plate 9.10). Two doors, one on either side,\nOpen into rooms off the corridor. The small room on the east\nside occupies the space between the corridor and the entrance\nvestibule. One tier of mugarnas corbelling (plate 9.11)\nremains of a transition zone that must originally have\nsupported a dome over the southern part of this room, which\nnow houses a latrine. Pieces of similar muqarnas, apparently\nfrom an upper tier of that corbelling, are to be found in the\nadjoining building to the north where they have been crudely\nincorporated into a later wall (plate 9.12).\n\nOn the west side of the corridor four steps rise to the door\nof a large cross-vaulted room which forms the north boundary\nof the western courtyard. The conjunction between the south-\neast corner of this room and the wall separating the courtyards\nshows that the room existed before the Awhadiyya was built. A\nthick coat of plaster conceals the masonry walls of the interior\nand so there is no sign here of the blocked doorway previously\nobserved in the adjoining room to the north (part of the\nnorthern annexes of the Dawadariyya, see above, p. 164). In the\nsouth wall of the room there are two windows (the eastern one\n recently enlarged) with a narrow slit window between them.\nUnder the western window a door and five roughly made steps\nlead down to the western courtyard.\n The original beautifully laid paving, which survives almost\nintact in the eastern courtyard, extends into the western\ncourtyard where it is less well preserved. Enough of it remains\nto confirm that both courtyards retain their original form. The\nwestern courtyard has no cornice moulding around its walls. Its\neast boundary is the wall separating it from the eastern\ncourtyard. Its west boundary is formed by the east wall of the\nearlier Dawadariyya (no. 8) and its north boundary is formed\nby the pre-existing room described above. On the south side of\nthe courtyard a large vaulted chamber, part of the original\nconstruction, is now divided by a thin partition wall (see plan,\n\nfig. 9.3). This chamber was entered by a door in the south-west\ncorner of the courtyard; a second door to the east of it is a later\ninsertion. Originally the chamber was lit and ventilated by a\nsmall window above the former door; there were no openings\nin the south (Haram) wall.\n\nMujir al-Din calls the building a ribat, known as a\nmadrasa, yet listed in his catalogue of monuments as a terba\n(above, p. 167). So it would appear that the tomb (turba) was\ncombined with either a ribat or a madrasa, both of which need\nto provide accommodation: the ribat for pilgrims, the madrasa\nfor students. This would explain the purpose of the second\ncourtyard. The main funerary complex occupies the eastern\ncourtyard, while the western courtyard with its adjoining\nrooms must have lodged pilgrims or students.\n A rectangular sump in the bottom step at the entrance to\nthe tomb antechamber has a shallow basin decorated with an\neight-petalled rosette around a central sink hole that\npresumably fed water to a cistern below. Various shallow\nrunnels cut in the paving of the eastern courtyard appear to\nhave been intended to direct rainwater towards this or another\nsink (which no longer survives). A recess under the stairway in\nthe western courtyard houses a well-head where water could\nbe drawn from the cistern.\n\n(ii) Upper levels (figs.9.4and 9.5)\n\nThe stairway against the east wall of the western courtyard rises\nto a landing that originally gave access to the roof of the room\non the south side of the western courtyard. The present cross-\nvaulted room built on that roof (see mezzanine plan, fig. 9.4) is\nnot original; its north-facing double window surmounted by an\nogee-headed slit (plate 9.13) is typically Ottoman. On the east\nside of the landing there is a deep recess, possibly originally a\nwindow lighting the tomb antechamber to the east. The\nmasonry around the recess contains several re-used stones\nwith distinctive Crusader diagonal tooling and masons’ marks.\n\nThe stairs continue upwards from the landing to the roof\nof the Haram portico, where a shallow 7wan, facing south, leads\ninto an upper room built beside the dome of the tomb\nchamber. At first glance this room, which encroaches upon the\n  courtyards (but not the Siifis in the courtyard of the adjoining\nDawadariyya Khanqah) and also to take advantage of the\nimpressive view over the Haram to the south. That being so, the\nbuilders were faced with the problem of how to suppott its east\nwall. Either they could build it on top of the structurally weak\nclear span of the tomb antechamber’s vault or, as they did, place\nit as far as possible to the east where it sits securely over the\nmore robust structure of the arch between the antechamber\nand the tomb, even though this entailed removing part of the\ndrum’s cornice. Thus the room must have been built after the\n dome had been completed. But it was not an afterthought, for\nthe four windows (now blocked) in the drum supporting the\ndome are placed on the diagonal axes, not on the cardinal axes\nas one would expect, so as to allow for the adjoining\nconstruction of the upper floor room.\n 1 Al-Umari, Masdlik, 158.\n\n2 Mujir, ii, 22.\n\n3, Mujir, ii, 39.

The Crusader capital on the right-hand side of\nthe present entrance to the Qubbat al-Nahwiyya (604/1207-8, entrance rebuilt in\nthe thirteen/nineteenth century) has two naturalistic birds with similarly drilled\nand filled eyes which have unaccountably escaped mutilation.\n\n22 The rosette may well have been a heraldic device in Mamluk times as L.A.\nMayer, SH, 24-25, and M.

The manifest sturdiness of its construction has\nwithstood several earthquakes with little trace of damage. Yet\nthe variety and design of its decoration — notably the muqarnas\ncorbelling supporting the galleries and the marble nook-shafts\nin the outer corners of the fourth and fifth storeys — lend it a\ncertain elegance that belies its enormous solidity.\n\nOf the two base storeys, only the east and south faces are\nvisible; the north and west faces abut directly against the\nscarped rock in the corner of the Haram. All four sides of the\nupper storeys are exposed. Each storey is distinguished from\nthe others by its architectural details, which are repeated on all\nfour sides. Sockets about 0.20m square at various levels in the\nsides of the minaret appear to be putlog holes that would have\nheld scaffolding in place during construction.\n\nThe two base storeys are reinforced by corner buttresses\n(plate 10.2). In the lowest storey, recesses in the exposed south\n and east sides between these buttresses have sloping sills and\ncavetto heads decorated with a repeated mugarnas motif. The\nsecond storey, which steps back slightly, has in each exposed\nside a blind double arch composed of gadrooned voussoirs\nsupported by three re-used Crusader columns complete with\ncapitals and bases. The round horseshoe profile of the arches is\nnoteworthy, suggestive perhaps of Andalusian influence (see\nabove, p. 91). Above the keystones of each arch and in the\ncommon spandrel between these three columns, column\ndrums have been set into the masonry in order to strengthen\nthe masonry bond. A further column drum is set at the same\nlevel into the two south-facing corner buttresses. One course\nhigher, a slightly recessed panel, framed by bands of red stone\nabove and below, seems to have been intended for an\ninscription which was never carved. Above that, three tiers of\nbold muqarnas corbelling support a parapet wall around the\nlower gallery.\n\nThe third storey, set back from the base to allow for the\ngallery, has a shallow cavetto-headed recess in each side. Little\npaired round-headed windows with bevelled jambs open in\nthese recesses. Those in the north and east sides are blind.\nDividing the third storey from the fourth is a projecting string\ncourse with a sloping top surface. This string course is\ndecorated in an unusual manner with a regular series of small,\narched niches.\n\nThe fourth storey has re-used Crusader columns with\ncapitals and bases set in nooks in all four corners. In the middle\nof each side is a shallow recess spanned by two pointed arches\nsupported by a central corbel. The recesses in the east, north\nand west sides each enclose a smaller, bevel-edged square\nrecess containing an octagonal window, blind in the east and\nnorth sides. The south recess contains a square window. A\nrecessed rectangular panel enclosing the paired arches of each\nrecess is pierced by a small diamond-shaped window. Dividing\nthis storey from the fifth is a projecting string course decorated\nwith a cavetto moulding with repeated muqarnas elements\ncarved into it and pendent mzqarnas ‘stalactites’ at the corners.\n\nThe fifth storey also has re-used Crusader columns for\nnook-shafts in the corners. In the middle of each side a recess\ncontaining a rectangular window is spanned by paired pointed-\narches supported by a central column, also of Crusader\nmanufacture and complete with capitals and bases. Above this\nstorey two tiers of vigorous muqarnas corbelling support the\nmuezzin’s gallery around the sixth storey.\n\nIn each side of the sixth storey are further double-arched\nrecesses, all containing two rectangular windows except for the\none in the south side which contains a door to the staircase. The\narches are supported by further re-used Crusader columns,\nthree of which carry remarkable historiated capitals, also\nCrusader. The balustrade and canopy of the gallery were\nreplaced during the 1341/1922-23 repairs.\n\nThe octagonal lantern has pointed-arched recesses in each\nside, all containing slit windows save the east one which has a\ndoor evidently intended to allow access to the roof of the\n canopy. A continuous hoodmould frames the extrados of the\narches. This storey is crowned by a simple splayface moulding,\nabove which is the drum, pierced by windows on the cardinal\naxes. Each of these windows is square on the exterior but\npointed inside. The bulbous dome, separated from the drum\nby a splayface moulding, was refurbished during the 1922-23\nrepairs. It is surmounted by a bronze crescent finial.\n\nINTERIOR\n\nThe entrance to the minaret is reached by a long open stair that\nrises northwards against a plain building that projects into the\nHaram from the north rock scarp (fig. 10.3). The scarp at this\npoint is cut back to form a re-entrant angle. The staircase (plate\n10.3) follows the line of the scarp, turning westwards along it to\nrise to a rectangular door in the east face of the second storey\nof the minaret.” Above this door is the inscription recording the\n1922-23 repairs. The door leads to a vaulted passage along the\nnorth side of the minaret. At its west end it opens on the roofs\nof adjoining buildings to the west. In its south side a door leads\n into the spiral staircase to the muezzin’s gallery. This staircase\nis roofed by a continuous rising barrel vault and is lit by the\nvarious windows described above. It gives access first of all to\nthe lower gallery by a door opening east. The lower gallery\nextends only along the east and south sides. It could well have\nbeen used by muezzins as an alternative to the higher gallery,\nAt the level of the higher gallery the staircase stops at a door\nopening south to the gallery.\'° Here the newel is carried up\nabove the last step in the form of a re-used column, and is\ncrowned by an interesting capital decorated with muqarnas\nniches (plate 10.4). A hole in the ceiling of this area will have\nallowed access to the interior of the lantern. Through this hole\nthe unusual construction of the transition zone under the\ncircular drum and dome may be observed (plate 10.5). It\nconsists of intersecting arches of a type more commonly\nassociated with the architecture of Andalusia or Armenia, and it\nis conceivable that the craftsmen responsible for it came from\none of these regions (see above, p. 91).\n Notes\n\n1 Mujir, 379. Ibn ‘Abd Rabbihi (wrote c.300/913) enumerated four minarets in\nthe Haram (G. Le Strange, Palestine under the Moslems, London, 1890, 163) which\nmay have existed still in the Crusader period, for William of Tyre saw tall towers\n(turres sublimes) from which muezzins formerly made the call to prayer (RHCOc,\ni, chap. iii). Clermont-Ganneau (Archaeological Researches in Palestine during\nthe years 1873-1874, London, 1899, 145) has suggested that these early minarets\ncorrespond to ‘certain strategic fortified points in the ancient enclosing wall of the\nTemple’.\n\nTo the east of the present Ghawanima Minaret an opening in the north rock\nscarp about 3.5m above the ground (see plate 10.6) leads into a small cave, which\nhas a square hole in its floor to give access to a cylindrical cistern that probably\nbelongs to some earlier development of the site.\n\n2 KA.C.

The adjoining\nstructures to east and west appear to be later (see below); the\nbuildings on the upper floor are obviously Ottoman.\n\nThe eastern limit of the facade is quite clear since it forms\nthe corner where the two streets meet. Here a later arch,\nopening into the street leading down to Tarig al-Wad, has been\nkeyed into the original masonry of the facade. In the left-hand\nspandrel of the arch, under a cyma moulding that runs\neastwards away from the Jaligiyya (fig. 11.4), an inscription has\nbeen inserted into the masonry of the Jaliqiyya facade. It\ncommemorates the completion, in 874/1469 during the reign\nof Sultan Qaytbay, of the restoration of the aqueducts supplying\nwater to the Haram,” which meet under the street near this\npoint.\n The western limit of the facade is not readily identifiable\nbecause the later stonework of the adjoining building has been\ndovetailed into the stonework of the tomb to form a ragged\njunction (see fig. 11.4). The only continuous vertical joint,\nwhich probably marks the western limit of the original\nstructure, is in the two lowest courses 3.22m to the left of the\ncentre-line of the grilled window. The eastern corner of the\nfacade is 3.48m to the right of that centre-line, making the\noriginal facade not quite symmetrical about the window but\nnearly so. Of course, some earlier structure now replaced by\nthe present building to the west of the Jaligiyya may once have\noccupied that adjoining site, and any near symmetry detectable\nin plan need not have been evident on the facade.\n\nAbove a level coinciding with the top of the inscription, all\nthe masonry appears to belong to some later rebuilding of the\nupper facade, presumably done when the adjoining upper\nstoreys were added. The cavetto moulding, four courses above\nthe inscription, belongs to that later rebuilding; it may,\nhowever, be in re-use in its present position and we cannot rule\nout the possibility that this moulding once formed a cornice on\nthe south and east facades.\n\nThe dome rises above the facade but is now concealed by\na later parapet wall (plate 11.2). It seems, however, never to\nhave been as prominent a feature as the domes of other tombs,\nfor it has no drum.\n EAST FRONTAGE (fig. 11.6)\n\nThe street corner forms the southern limit of the east frontage.\nThe northern limit coincides with a distinct break in the\nmasonry about 9.40m from the corner. The lowest masonry\ncourses (owing to the slope of the street, that is the first course\nabove street level at the south end up to the third above street\nlevel at the north end) are built of large stones, many of which\nare very roughly dressed (plate 1 1.3). These stones may belong\nto the earlier structure, mentioned above, that once occupied\nthe site. Three courses of smaller masonry have been laid on\ntop of the roughly dressed lowest courses to form a level\nsurface on which the east wall of the tomb was constructed in\nmasonry similar to that of the south facade. The uppermost\ncourses are concealed by a later vault spanning the street; this\nyault is obviously contemporaneous with the arch at its south\nend, described above.\n\nAn iron-grilled window, similar in size to the one in the\nsouth facade, opens into the tomb chamber. North of that\nwindow is the original entrance, now blocked save for a small\ngrilled window. At some time, perhaps during an earthquake,\nthis corner of the building was damaged: the door lintel is\ncracked and is now supported by the blocking masonry, and\nthe stonework of the upper north end of the wall has been\ncrudely rebuilt in uncoursed rubble. The adjoining structure to\nthe north appears to be later.\n INTERIOR (plan, fig. 11.3; sections, figs. 11.7 and 11.8)\n\n() Antechamber\n\nThe entrance door in the east wall opened into the\nantechamber with a door in its south wall into the tomb\nchamber. The antechamber has undergone various alterations.\n The present cross vault is not original, and a modern concrete-\nblock partition encloses an area in front of the door into the\ntomb chamber. Two bare springers, one in the north wall and\nOne opposite it at the same level in the south wall, are shaped\nin a way that indicates that originally a transverse arch divided\na barrel vault roofing the eastern part of the chamber from a\ncross vault over the western part. A similar springer in the\nsouth-west corner of the chamber suggests that it was open to\nthe west, like an zwan.\n A pointed-arched doorway (plate 11.4), typically Mamluk\nin form, in the north wall of the antechamber leads into a cross-\nvaulted room with a blocked opening in its east wall. This\nroom, to judge from the definite break in the masonry of the\neast frontage (above), must belong to a later addition.\n\nThe buildings to the west of the antechamber and tomb\nchamber are quite plain (apart from a re-used column with a\nbase for a capital) and appear mostly to be Ottoman (plate\n11.5). It was in this area that a Dar al-Hadith was founded in 666/\n1268” by Amir Sharaf al-Din Abi Muhammad ‘Isa but if it\nsurvives there is nothing remarkable in the present\nconstructions on the site to allow its identification.\n\n(ti) Tomb chamber\n\nThe floor of the tomb chamber is raised 0.50m above that of the\nantechamber. A stone cenotaph, 1.70m long and 0.89m wide,\noccupies the centre of the floor (plate 11.8). Presumably, it\nmarks the grave of the founder. A smaller cenotaph, 1.03m long\nand 0.61m wide, rests against its north side, marking the grave\nof some unknown person. The larger cenotaph has four\nunusually well-preserved corner posts (plate 11.7) of reddish\nlimestone, all decorated in the same way with pointed-arched\nniches cut in each of the shaft’s eight sides, on top of which sits\na bulbous knob lightly carved in the customary manner with\neight drooping petals.21 The smaller cenotaph has simpler\n Notes\n\n1 RW.

These arches open into\nshallow recesses on the north and south sides (0.42m and\n0.38m respectively) and a deeper (1.12m) recess on the east\nside. On the west side (plate 11.6) there is no recess, but it\nappears that the present west wall, built flush with the arch\nsurmounting it, is secondary and has been constructed about\n0.90m nearer to the centre of the room than the original wall.\nThis can be inferred from details observed in the masonry of\nthe south facade and from some curious irregularities in the\nspringings of vaulting in the adjoining room to the west. If we\nassume that the vertical straight joint near the western end of\nthe two lowest courses in the facade represents the outer face\nof the original west wall of the tomb chamber, and if we assume\nthat the wall had the same thickness (0.70 — 0.72m) as the other\nwalls of the chamber, then the interior plan would have been\napproximately symmetrical (as shown dotted fig. 11.3) with a\nrecess in the west wall corresponding to that in the east.\n\nThe fact that the tomb chamber is rectangular, requiring\nadjustments to be made in order to provide a square base for\nthe dome, suggests that its plan was perhaps dictated by the\ndimensions of a pre-existing building.\n\nThere are openings in the middle of all four walls: grilled\nwindows in the east and south walls opening on the streets, the\nentrance door in the north wall, and a door (now blocked) in\nthe later west infill wall. Several stones with diagonal tooling\ncharacteristic of Crusader workmanship have been re-used in\nthe jambs of the east window.\n\nThe finest feature of the tomb chamber is the internal\ndecoration of the zone of transition between the base and the\ndome (figs. 11.7 and 11.8). This zone consists of three tiers of\nmugqarnas which effect the transition by way of coffered\nsquinches in the corners (plate 11.9). Small pointed-arched\nwindows in the middle of each side at the same height as the\nsquinches (plate 11.10) illuminated the muqgarnas decoration,\nmaking it readily visible from the street through the lower\nwindows; only the southern one now remains open.

To the left of the portal the remains\nof an arched opening in the masonry of the facade are\n discernible. Only the right-hand springer of the arch survives.\nThe opening is now blocked by a later wall that extends\nwestward for some distance up the street. The height and\ncurvature of the springer indicate that the Opening was\napproximately 2.5m wide.\n\nThe entrance door is set ina portal recess 1.58m wide and\n0.79m deep, spanned by three tiers of mugqarnas corbelling\nSupporting a slightly pointed ashlar semidome (plate 13.2).\nThis is the second muqarnas portal built in Jerusalem, the first\nbeing that of the Dawadariyya (no. 8). The muqarnas.\ncorbelling is not quite symmetrical for an extra half-niche has\nbeen carved on the facade to the left of the second tier (see\nplate 13.3). The blocks of stone in which the muqarnas\n corbelling is carved protrude unevenly on the facade,\nsuggesting that the carving was done in a workshop and then\nfound not to fit together perfectly when raised into place. The\nextra half-niche may represent an attempt to disguise the\ndiscrepancy. A little arched window opens in the centre of the\ntwo lower tiers.\n\nUnder the corbelling, the recess is built of red and\nbrownish ablag masonry. The upper courses of red masonry\nextend unevenly onto the facade (see fig. 13.4). Stone benches\non either side of the recess have curious rounded bases\nperhaps intended as foot-rests.\n\nTwo courses above the door lintel a very unusual frieze of\ninlaid strapwork runs around the recess (plate 13.3). The\ngrooves to take the inlay are chased in two courses of ashlars to\ncreate a pattern of strapwork enclosing two rows of plain\nlimestone octagons, altogether four in each side and eight in\nthe back of the recess. The original inlay has disappeared to be\nreplaced by a nasty smear of cement, except on the east side\n(plate 13.4) where the lower part of the frieze is inlaid with\npieces of cut stone of various colours, and the upper part is\nfilled with red and black coloured mortar. The cut stone inlay\nmust be a later insertion for it is crudely done with no attempt\nto follow the cardinal rule of strapwork: that individual strands\nmust cross alternately over and under each other. In the upper\npart, however, the red and black strands do cross in the\nprescribed manner and it is quite possible that this coloured\nmortar is a remnant of the original inlay. The red colour is given\nby large quantities of crushed pottery, and the black by large\nquantities of charcoal!” in the mix.\n\nOn either side of the portal the later street vault springs\nfrom pieces of a cyma recta moulding built into the facade,\nwhich: py-analoovawithithe Dawmadationgs (hace m. 1oa\\ may\n once have formed a cornice around the building. No other\npieces of this moulding are known to survive.\n\nTo the right of the portal two windows of the tomb\nchamber are placed off centre in a shallow recess, 0. 21m deep\n(plate 13.1). Though much of the upper part of the recess is\nhidden by the later street vaulting, enough is visible to show\nthat a cavetto moulding runs across the top. Three intrusive re-\nused columns, one on the left and two on the right side of the\nrecess, support that street vaulting. The grilled windows are\nbuilt in red and brownish ablag which, at the right-hand side,\n does not extend for the full width of the recess. A panel of\nmarble, evidently intended for an inscription that was never\ncarved, is sunk in a frame of red stone above the masonry pier\nbetween the two windows. At a higher level in the recess are\ntwo relieving arches built into the masonry above the windows.\n\nThe south-east corner of the building is chamfered up toa\nheight of 2.98m above the present pavement, presumably in\norder to reduce abrasion of the corner. The top of the chamfer\nis adjusted to the square corner above by means of two tiers of\ndelicate muqarnas corbelling.\n EAST FACADE\n\nAs plate 13.5 shows, the east facade is almost wholly hidden\nbehind an ornate fountain erected by order of the Ottoman\nSultan Sulayman the Magnificent in 943/1537. The upper part of\na recess, like the one in the street facade, is, however, visible\nabove the fountain. A small, high-level window opens in the\nmiddle of that part of the recess.\n\nThe north-east corner of the building, to the right of the\nfountain, is recognizable in a vertical joint in the masonry\nwhere the wall of the Ribat al-Nisa’ abuts against it (see below,\np. 240). This corner is not chamfered.\n\nINTERIOR (plan, fig. 13.3)\n\nThe entrance portal opens into a narrow corridor leading toa\ndoor into the tomb chamber on the right and, opposite that, a\ndoor into the western hall on the left.\n\n@ Tomb chamber\n\nThe tomb chamber has pointed-arched recesses of different\ndepths in all four sides, which reduce the central area to a\nperfect square in plan. This central area, now roofed by a cross\nvault, was originally covered by a dome as the document cited\nabove (p. 195) confirms. The recess to the east is much deeper\nthan the other three, perhaps to provide a place for Koran\nreadings. It is the extra depth of this recess that accounts for the\nasymmetry of the tomb chamber’s street facade.\n\nThere are twin openings in the rear wall of each recess.\nThose in the north wall (plate 13.6) are now blocked though\nthey may originally have contained windows. The far (north)\nface of this wall, which is the rear wall of an wan in the Ribat\nal-Nisa’, reveals no trace of such windows but that face is very\nrough and appears to have undergone some rebuilding. Three\ncourses of modern concrete blocks at the top of the south face\nof the wall (see plate 13.6) are further evidence of some\nrebuilding. The recesses in the east wall are used as cupboards;\nand while careful scrutiny failed to produce evidence that they\never contained windows, the possibility cannot be ruled out.\nThe Ottoman fountain precludes examination of the exterior.\n The floor of the chamber is raised about 1.20m above\nstreet level. The eastern part of the floor is 0.23m higher than\nthe western. A step between the two levels has a westward\nsalient that forms a base for an unusually small (0.98 x 0.98m)\nstone cenotaph. Four octagonal posts with domical caps stand\nat the corners of the cenotaph (plate 13.7). These posts are\ndecorated with two pointed-arched niches in each side,\narranged one above the other. The south-east post has lost its\ntop; the caps on the other three are carved with eight drooping\npetals. The carving of the north-west post is cruder than that of\nthe others, as if it were a copy of them.\n\n(ti) Western hall\nThe western hall is roofed by two cross vaults separated by a\ntransverse arch. It has undergone several changes. The\nnorthern part is blocked off by a later wall, and the southern is\npartitioned off and divided into two levels by the insertion of a\nlow barrel vault.\n\nA room in the lower level (marked ‘Z’ on the plan, fig.\n13.3), the floor of which is a little below present street level, is\nreached by descending five steps through a door in the\npartition wall. This room is lit by a semicircular window on the\nstreet in the masonry that replaces the earlier arch in the street\nfacade (see above). The west wall of the room has at some time\nbeen carelessly hollowed out to provide extra space.\n\nA short flight of steps against the west wall of the hall leads\nup to a door into a room on the upper level, above ‘Z’. This\nroom is roofed by the continuation of the cross vault of the hall.\nIt has a window in its north wall opening north on the hall. A\nwide, ill-made opening in its east wall gives access to the\nnarrow, barrel-vaulted chamber, only 2.12m high, that sits\nabove the entrance corridor. This chamber is lit by the small slit\nwindow opening in the mugarnas corbelling of the entrance\n\nortal.\n; How much of all this is original is hard to tell. From the\ntraces of an arch in the facade it would appear that the western\nhall must have opened directly on the street. It may have been\nashop of some sort, belonging to the original construction and\n ','SOUTH FACADE, INTERIOR'),(14,'EARLIER REMAINS has re\n(i) Herodian Tower Antonia ores:\nThe early history of the site is controversial. Essentially the\ncontroversy centres on the problem of the extent of the Antonia\nand its relationship with the Temple ‘enclosure.*® ‘While it\nwould be inappropriate here to become involved in this\ncontroversy, we should, however, draw attention to two\ndiscoveries made during our survey of the area which cast new\nlight on the problem.\n\nThe first is the existence of a massive wall more than four\nmetres thick which, where not interrupted by secondary\napertures, forms the southern wall of a row of chambers along\nthe southern boundary of the site. The three extant rooms of\nthe madrasa are actually excavated in the thickness of this wall.\nBecause of its size and location, the wall is doubtless a vestige\nof the Antonia. Its eastern extension is broken by modern\nschool rooms to the east of the Jawiliyya, but further traces have\nbeen identified in the Is‘ardiyya (no. 33).\n\nThe second tends to confirm that the north-west corner of\nthe Herodian Temple enclosure coincided with the present\nnorth-west corner of the Haram where the Ghawanima Minaret\n(no. 10) now stands. Towards that corner the natural rock has\nbeen quarried away leaving a scarp of varying height to define\nthe Haram boundary. On the west side the scarp rises\nnorthward from about the present Bab al-Ghawanima, and on\nthe north side it rises westward from about the present Bab al-\n‘Atm. The line of the north scarp, if projected, would make an\nangle of 86/2° with that of the west scarp, but at the west end of\n the north scarp a 9m length of the rockface has been cut back a\nfurther 2.5m or so to form a re-entrant angle at the north-west\ncorner (plate 14.1). Above that corner a stone (marked ‘C’ on\n\' the planjfig. 14.2) is, as the distinctive marginal drafting on both\nits north and west faces indicates, almost certainly a Herodian\n\ncorner stone #i2\'situ (plate 14.2).\n\n(ii) Crusader. Chapel\n\n\' The ‘Antonia was. largely destroyed in A.D. 70 (above, p. 44).\n; Thereafter virtually nothing is known of the history of the site\n~ it may well, have lain in ruins — until the second half of the\nsixth/twelfth century when, apparently with the\nencouragement of the Templars, the association of the site with\nthe Praetorium or Domus Pilati of Christian tradition was\nrevived. Connected with the Praetorium in that tradition was\nthe idea of a ‘Chapel of Repose’ in which Christ is reputed to\n. have rested after his capture in Gethsemane. This association\nwas commemorated by the dedication, evidently in about A.D.\n1160,** of a small chapel with a domed porch, some parts of\nwhich survive (plate 14.3) immediately to the west of the\n Two photographs (plates 14.4 and 14.5) from the Matson\nPhoto Service Collection show the domed porch still standing\nafter the demolition of much of the madrasa. The porch was\nattached to one of the chambers ranged along the south wall of\nthe compound in such a way as to imply that these chambers\nwere built before the middle of the sixth/twelfth century; the\nprecise date of their construction is not known . After Saladin’s\nconquest of Jerusalem (above, p. 48), access to Christians must\n have been difficult if not impossible, though the association of\nthe site with the Praetorium of Pilate endured.”\n\n(iti) Ayyubid grave\n\nThe history of the site during the seventh/thirteenth century\nremains unknown but for one detail given by Mujir al-Din:\n\n.. . in it [ie. the compound containing the Jawiliyya\nMadrasa] is the burial place (madfan) of Shaykh Darbas al-\nKurdi al-Hakkari . . >\n\nToday a burial place is marked by a low stone cenotaph — the\nonly visible indication of a grave within the compound — under\nthe remains of the domed Crusader porch.*’ While the\nunweathered condition and fresh pick-dressing of the stone\ncenotaph suggest that it is of relatively recent manufacture, it is\nnot unreasonable to suppose that it replaces an older cenotaph\nmarking the grave of ‘Shaykh Darbas’ whose misbas, al-Kurdi al-\nHakkari, show that he belonged to the notable Kurdish tribe of\nHakkari.** Many of the Hakkari tribe fought alongside Saladin,\nsome ultimately settling in Jerusalem, and several are known to\nhave been buried there between 587/1191 and 614/1217-18.°\nThus, although the date of Shaykh Darbas’s death is not\nspecified, we may be justified in assuming that he, like those\nfellow tribesmen, died some time around the beginning of the\nseventh/thirteenth century.\n\nJAWILIYYA MADRASA\n\nThe subsequent history of the site is unusually well\ndocumented partly because, from the beginning of the ninth/\nfifteenth century” until the beginning of the thirteenth/\nnineteenth century, it was the administrative headquarters, the\nGovernment House of the successive Mamlik and Ottoman\ngovernors of Jerusalem, and partly as a result of the continuing\nChristian tradition linking it with the Praetorium.\n\nLATER RENOVATIONS AND ALTERATIONS\nRenovations were decreed (rusima bi-tajdid), completed by\nthe Amir Shuja‘ al-Din Shahin probably about 832/1429, and\nwere commemorated in a short inscription (see p. 204).\"\nThese may have been necessitated by the conversion of the\nJawiliyya compound to the Government House (dar al-\nniyaba).\n\nFurther changes made at the end of the ninth/fifteenth\ncentury are recorded by Mujir al-Din:\n\nIn 892 (1486-87) the Amir Khidrbak, governor of\nJerusalem, built at the Government House the loggia\n(magqad) next to the north side of the van of justice\n(hukm). He had it made according to the manner of\nChambers of Justice (majalis al-bukkdm) in Egypt with a\nceiling of painted wood. Formerly the Governor sat in the\nforemost part (bi-sadr: i.e. in the southern part next to the\nwindows)” of the zwdn but afterwards he sat in the loggia\nand this is more appropriate than the previous\narrangement . . .¥\n\nAs we shall see (below, p. 207) no vestige of these particular\nextensions and alterations described by Mujir al-Din appear to\nhave survived. After the Ottoman conquest of Jerusalem in 922/\n1517 the Jawiliyya compound continued to serve as the\nGovernment House. By the end of the sixteenth century\nrestricted Christian access to the place was possible.** Indeed,\nBernardino Amico included a sketch of the interior in his\nTratto delle Piante et Imagini de i Sacri Edificii di Terra Santa®\nbut the rendering is too stylized to convey an accurate\nimpression of the buildings. However, his accompanying\ncommentary includes the observation that the zwdan was then\nstill in use for the administration of justice:\n\n... here one enters a big salon of thirty steps in length and\nfifteen in width, the windows of which salon open on the\nsouth and look out on the piazza of the Temple. They say\nthat in this salon was the praetorium, where Christ was\nsentenced to death and today also justice is administered\nhere.*°\n About thirty years later another Christian observer, Pére\nEugene Roger (A.D. 1632), was gratified by the lack of success\nof some building operations on the site:\n\nWhen this Moustafa Bay [Governor of Jerusalem] made this\nplace a Stable, he built above a chamber where his wives\ncould come from their lodging; but as soon as it was\nfinished it fell, and was demolished; and having been re-\nerected, and almost completed, it fell for the second time,\nso that this sacred site remains entirely as it was before .. .‘”\n\nElzear Horn’s description of the Praetorium, written in the\nsecond quarter of the eighteenth century, is notable for its\nuncommonly precise description, which gives a clear\nimpression of the layout. It shows that by then parts of the\nJawiliyya Madrasa were already neglected:\n\n... and one comes to the centre of thirteen steps, by which\none ascends to the gate, within which, advancing to the\nsouth for a distance of eleven feet and having ascended\nthree other steps, one enters into the little atrium [i.e. the\ncourtyard of the Jawiliyya Madrasa] of the Praetorium,\nwhich is twenty-six feet wide and fifty feet long .. . the place\nis open to the sky and paved with hewn square stones; on\neither side it has five small rooms; on the east side only\none is inhabited, on the west side one serves for\ndeliquents to bé imprisoned with chains to be fastened\naround the neck; on either side of the aforesaid entrance\nthere are a further two; of all the rest of them some are\nempty and others are blocked up with stones . .. From this\nlittle atrium, or more justly I should say little cloister, one\nascends by two steps through the gate to the Praetorium,\nwhich is twenty-six feet long and nineteen and a quarter\nwide . . . There are two doors, one to the right and the\nother to the left; both give access to a small cubicle; that to\nthe west, standing against the west wall, does not give\naccess elsewhere, although formerly, by thirteen steps,\nthere was a way to the upper part of the house .. .*\n\nIn 1835 when Jerusalem was under the rule of Ibrahim Pasha,\nthe Jawiliyya was rebuilt as barracks:\n\nDuring this month, August 1835, the Praetorium of Pilate\nwas finished. It was formerly a serai, or palace for the\nPashas and governors of Jerusalem but it is now the gishlaq\nor barracks of the regular soldiers of Ibrahim Pasha. It had,\nin virtue of its age, to be almost entirely rebuilt from the\nfoundation. Dressed stones were taken from many ruins\nthroughout the city for its rebuilding...”\n\nAnd so it remained until the Turkish surrender of Jerusalem to\nthe advancing British forces in 1917. Van Berchem, who visited\nthe site in 1914, states that at that time it was an infantry\nbarracks, adding that in one of the upper rooms he was\nreceived by the military governor of Jerusalem.” Van\nBerchem’s description, written almost two centuries after that\n of Elzear Horn (above) and accompanied by a sketch plan (fig.\n14.4) but no photograph of the interior, suggests, however, that\nduring the period the Jawiliyya Madrasa underwent no major\nstructural changes, only a steady deterioration:\n\n...a wretched staircase E ... by which one ascends to an\nold doorway P, to come out by way of a vestibule V into a\nrectangular courtyard C with its main axis aligned north-\nsouth enclosed by walls of dressed stone. Its three sides,\nnorth, east and west are pierced by doors opening into\nvaulted cells; the walls of the cells are still standing but in\nan advanced state of ruin. The south side is entirely\noccupied by a large pointed arch A, which formerly\nopened into the qibla iwén LS . . . Today this arch is\nblocked by a wall in which a low door p has been made...\nThe door gives access to the iwén LS, which consists of a\nlarge barrel-vaulted hall, flanked by two smaller cross-\nvaulted rooms. These three chambers, extending to the\nsouth beyond some unsightly modern partitions open on\nthe Haram through five grilled windows.*!\n\nThe latest phase in the architectural evolution of the site\noccurred in 1923-24 during the British Mandate when the\ncompound was taken over for a new school, which involved\nmany structural changes including the destruction of some\nbuildings and the construction of new ones. A summary\nArabic inscription over the street entrance records the event:\n\nThe structure (#mdra) of this madrasa was renewed\n(juddida) by the Supreme Islamic Shari‘a Council; the\nyear 1342 (1923-24)\n\nThough much of the Jawiliyya Madrasa no longer survives,\nits initial layout can be determined from the accounts outlined\nabove and its position in the central part of the surrounding\ncompound is defined by the gibla twain and its flanking rooms.\nThe brief description which follows is restricted to the Jawiliyya\nMadrasa alone and reference to adjoining buildings is made\nonly where they have some bearing on the analysis of the\nJawiliyya. It will suffice here to note that, apart from the massive\nsouthern wall — a vestige of the Tower Antonia on which abut\nthe more or less intact walls of some pre-Mamliak structures\nincluding the Crusader ‘Chapel of the Repose’ — all other\nconstruction around the compound appears to be either\nOttoman or modern.\n\nHARAM FACADE\n\nThe northern boundary of the Haram at its west end consists,\nup to a varying height, of scarped rock. At higher levels the rock\nis revetted with masonry, which displays variations suggesting\nseveral phases of work (plate 14.6). Only at the very base of the\nrevetment are there marginally drafted ashlars in the Herodian\nstyle (visible in plate 14.7); the heterogeneous facing of the\nupper wall is doubtless the result of later, post-Herodian\nrepairs which have masked the full extent and height to which\nthe ancient wall survives. However, the continuing line of the\ninner face of the wall is indicated by the precise alignment of\nthe southern ends of the series of rooms shown in fig. 14.2\nalong the southern boundary of the site. In the three rooms of\nthe madrasa the line is represented by a slight restriction in the\nwidth of each room. All this shows that the wall still stood at this\nae when the madrasa and other structures to the west were\n\nuilt,\n\nThus the ablaq facade of alternate courses of red and\ncream-coloured limestone was built as a decorative facing\nagainst the ancient wall, incorporating five windows arranged\nsymmetrically about the central axis (plate 14.7). The ablaq\nfacing extends laterally only a short distance beyond the two\noutermost windows and the upper limit is defined by a simple\nmoulded string course (damaged at the left-hand, western\nend). Slight but consistent variations in the degree of\nProjection, size and texture of the masonry® to the west and\neast of the ablaq facade suggest that at the time of the\nconstruction of the Jawiliyya the string course over the\n\npuede. Soh <A gaat LY gan Chae emt | pie Nr geen ea to AMM eo aes,\n windows nearly coincided with the top of the ancient wall. The\nvaults of the gibla iwdn and its flanking rooms must originally\nhave protruded above the skyline®! The two rectangular\nwindows and central oculus now concealed behind a caper\nbush in the facade above the string course (plate 14.7) may\nbelong to later repairs or rebuilding (see below): al-‘Umari\nmentions only ‘five windows of the Madrasa of the Amir ‘Alam\nal-Din Sanjar al-Jawilt’.>\n\nThe rooms above the iwan’s vault, indeed all the rooms at\nthe uppermost floor level, appear to be Ottoman.® The two-\nstorey range of schoolrooms to the east was built in 1923-24.\n\nENTRANCE\n\nThe position of the steps leading up to the present entrance to\nthe Jawiliyya compound from the street, Tariq al-Saray al-\nQadim, which forms the northern boundary of the compound,\nhas not changed since at least the sixteenth century.” The\nmeans of access to the compound from the street in the\nfourteenth century is not recorded, though such access\ncertainly existed since al-‘Umari states specifically that there\nwas no direct access from the Haram.\n\nNothing more is known of the entrance to the Jawiliyya\nMadrasa itself (van Berchem’s ‘old doorway P’ leading into a\nsmall vestibule to the inner courtyard) than we can read in\nHorn or van Berchem.\n\nINTERIOR\nWithin the present compound a rectangular podium (plate\n14.8) projects northwards in front of the gibla iwan of the\nmadrasa. The podium is now split in two levels, the lower one\nbeing reached by a narrow flight of eight steps and the upper\none by five steps more, thirteen in all, from the adjoining\nschoolyard. The mural masonry of the podium is a\nheterogeneous assemblage incorporating several re-used\nstones bearing Crusader masons’ marks which affirm its post-\nCrusader date of construction. On the evidence of Elzear Horn,\ncorroborated by van Berchem’s description and plan, it is clear\nthat the east boundary of the madrasa approximately coincided\nwith that of the podium. The western and northern limits of the\nmadrasa are not so clearly defined.\n\nFollowing Horn’s description, which is substantiated by\nvan Berchem’s plan, we find no direct connection between the\nmadrasa and the earlier domed chapel over the grave of Shaykh\n Darbas against which the missing western wall of the madrasa\nmust have abutted. According to Horn’s measurements (width\nof iwadn = 191% feet [actually 20 feet/6.11m], depth of zwdn 26\nfeet [actually 27 feet 10 inches/8.48m], length of courtyard = 50\nfeet/say, 16m, length of vestibule 11 feet/say, 2.5m) the\nnorthern boundary of the madrasa was about 3.7m beyond the\npresent northern limit of the podium.*\n\nThe tunnel-vaulted gibla iwan is two steps above the\nupper level of the podium and was, according to Horn, three\nsteps above the courtyard of the madrasa.® With a span of\n6.11m and a maximum height of 7.18m the ivan would have\ndominated the courtyard. Indeed, the reason for raising the\ncourtyard and its surrounding cells on a podium must have\nbeen simply in order Practically to match the level of the\ncourtyard with that of the zwan,. Plainly the higher ground level\n at the south side of the compound, the site of the 7wdn,\ndetermined the floor level of the zwan, which in turn governed\nthe level of the adjoining courtyard.\n\nThe iwén appears to survive in its original form, though\ncertain variations in the stonework at the springing of the\nbipartite tunnel vault ( plate 14.9) together with the abominable\nrepointing of the exterior (plate 14.10) denote the later repairs.\nAs we have seen (above, p. 204), the southern section of the\niwan is, at least for the lower part, hewn out of the ancient\n Antonia wall. The line of the ancient wall is indicated by a slight\nreduction in the width of the zwdan (plate 14.11). The back wall\nof the ivan is pierced by three grilled windows overlooking\nthe Haram, the central one being much taller and wider than\nthe side ones.\n\nEach of the rooms flanking the iwdn was originally\nentered through a side door in the fore part of the zd; the\ndoors in the rear part of the Zvdn and in the north walls of the\nrooms themselves (against which the cells of the madrasa\nabutted) are later insertions.” Both rooms are similar in\nconstruction, spanned by a lofty cross vault springing from\ncorbelled imposts (fig. 14.3), with a deep barrel-vaulted recess\nhewn into the ancient Antonia wall to admit light from a\nrectangular grilled window in the middle of the south wall.\nThere is a small window high in the south wall (opening on the\nHaram facade) and in the north wall. A doorway, now blocked,\nin the west wall of the western flanking room led to the\nCrusader chapel, the ‘Chapel of Repose’ (above, p. 204), from\nwhere the later staircase to an upper floor (as described by\nHorn) was reached.\n\nHERALDIC BLAZONS (fig. 14.6)\nTwo identical blazons, probably those of the founder, are\nplaced in the wall above the great pointed arch of the ivan, one\n Notes\n\n1 Mujjr, ii, 22.\n\n2 CIA (Ville), 228.\n\n3 Al-Umart, Masdlik, 159.

Pére Benoit has argued most\nconvincingly that Antonia did not extend nearly so far north (P. Benoit, ‘L’Antonia\nd’Hérode le Grand et le forum oriental d’Aelia Capitolina’, Harvard Theological\nReview, \\xiv, 1971, 135-67), and though the archaeological evidence is scanty, this\nis now the generally accepted view. Two differing views of the relationship\nbetween Antonia and the Temple enclosure are presented by, for example, J.\nSimons, Jerusalem in the Old Testament, Leiden, 1952, 413-20, and J. Wilkinson,\nJerusalem as Jesus knew it, London, 1978, 59-61, but both these views should be\nrevised in the light of our recent discoveries.\n34 For a discussion and dating of the figural capitals which once decorated the\nchapel, seeJ.

Cf. CIA (Ville), 226 n. 3. In the first half of the\nninteenth century the roof of the ‘Governors palace’ had become the usual\nvantage-point for foreigners wishing to view the Haram (see, e.g., the letter from\nFrederick Catherwood recounting his experiences in 1883, reproduced in W.H.\nBartlett, Walks about the City and Environs of Jerusalem, London, 1844, 148-65).\nBy the 1860s the view was regularly photographed (Anon. (photographs by John\nAnthony), 7he City of our Lord. Twelve Photographs of Jerusalem, London, 1861,\nplates facing pages 8 and 10; Francis Bedford, Holy Land and Syria,London 1865,\npl.6B). The absence of photographs of the interior from this period (see below,\nn. 58) may be explained rather by lack of interest on the part of photographers —\nunderstandable when one considers the much greater attraction of the alternative\nview to the south over the Haram — than security precautions such as those which\nnowadays prohibit the photographing of military installations throughout the\nMiddle East.\n\n50 CIA (Ville), 227 n.4.\n\n51 Jbid., 226-27, fig. 35.

The two windows\nset in shallow rectangular recesses crowned with muqarnas corbelling, which\nvan Berchem (CIA (Ville), 238) associates with the maq ad, are Ottoman, judging\nby the shallow and indecisive cutting of the muqarnasdt, the related star-shaped\nwindow, and their situation at the upper floor level. These windows were\nerroneously associated with the Muhaddathiyya Madrasa (waqf dated 762/1360) in\nM. Burgoyne, ‘Chronological Index to the Muslim Monuments of Jerusalem’,\nArchitecture of Islamic Jerusalem: an exhibition prepared on the occasion of the\nWorld of Islam Festival, London 1976, Jerusalem, 1976, No. 77. The windows\nshould be dated rather to the tenth/sixteenth century or eleventh/seventeenth\ncentury (cf. the remarks by Pére Roger cited above, p. 205).\n\n57 Steps leading up to the tenth/sixteenth-century entrance are shown in\ndrawings of Zullardo (1586) and Amico (1596) reproduced in Jérusalem\nNouvelle, Paris, 1922, figs. 257 and 236 respectively.\n\n58 The north-east corner is shown in a photograph dated 1905 reproduced in The\nFirst Photographs of Jerusalem: the Old City, ed.

Of course in this instance the lateral\nopenings in the rear part of the zvdn are cut through the core of the ancient\nAntonia wall, but the excessively high (60 cm) sills suggest that these openings\nwere never intended to be doors.\n\n61 The notion that the split keystone (i.e. a median joint at the crown of an arch)\nwas an exclusive feature of Crusader architecture was refuted long ago: see e.g.,\nC. Clermont-Ganneau, Archaeological Researches in Palestine during the years\n1873-1874, i, London, 1899, 2-3.\n\n62 CIA (Ville) 227.\n ','EARLIER REMAINS, JAWILIYYA MADRASA, LATER RENOVATIONS, HARAM FACADE, ENTRANCE, INTERIOR, HERALDIC BLAZONS'),(15,'ENTRANCE\n\nThe entrance portal (plate 15.1) is on the east side of Tariq Bab\nHitta immediately to the north of the Ayyibid north porch of\nthe gate. It is remarkable for its simplicity: a shallow pointed-\narched recess flanked by stone benches and enclosing a plain\nrectangular doorway (now blocked) surmounted by a large\nmonolithic lintel. Above the lintel a recessed panel,\npresumably intended for an inscription, is like most of the rear\nwall of the recess now covered with plaster bearing traces of a\npainted geometric decoration (plate 15.1). To the north of the\nentrance the large ashlars of the portal peter out into a later wall\nof small, quarry-finished, coursed masonry containing a plain\ndoor which serves as the present entrance. Beyond the present\nentrance there is another door opening to a relatively modern\n\nstairway, which is now the only means of access to the upper\nfloor.\n\nINTERIOR\n\n(@) Ground floor (fig. 15.3)\n\nThe vestibule inside the original entrance is a narrow passage\nrunning north and south, reflecting the overall narrowness of\nthe site. A narrow stone bench is squeezed against the east wall.\nIn spite of subsequent alterations it can be inferred that from\nthe beginning the vestibule opened in two directions:\nnorthward into a secondary porch and thence into a central\ncourtyard; southward directly into the principal chamber of the\nmadrasa (see below).\n\nThe central feature on the ground plan (fig. 15.3) is an\nopen courtyard extending from north to south into a tunnel-\nvaulted iwan, which led into a cross-vaulted ‘transverse\nchamber’, the principal ground floor room. A later arch has\nbeen added to the front of the original ivan opening (plate\n15.2). It has a double row of voussoirs, which in Jerusalem is\ntypical of Ottoman arch construction. Other Ottoman changes\naffecting these central rooms are a partition inserted to divide\nthe zwdan from the transverse chamber and another partition\nwall which divides that chamber itself into two parts. Thinking\naway those intrusive structures leaves us with a T-shaped unit as\nthe original Mamlik form for these rooms, and that an unusual\none.\n\nIn the east wall of the transverse chamber are a window\noverlooking the Birkat Bani Isra’il and a door surmounted bya\nwindow into a small vaulted room with two windows, one\nabove the other, facing north and a third facing east on to the\nsame pool (see plate 15.9). The chamber is additionally lit by a\n semicircular-arched window in the west wall; the building of\nthis wall blocked up the east-facing arch of the north porch of\nBab Hitta.\n\nThere are two alcoves in the south wall, being in fact the\nnorth wall of the Haram. For the purpose of these see p. 217\nbelow.\n\n(ii) Staircase\n\nA small barrel-vaulted room to the east of the iwvdn gives\nevidence of the original staircase giving access to the upper\nfloor. The far side of this room is spanned by a transverse\ntunnel vault rising steeply from north to south and revealing\nthe existence of a staircase. The steps have been removed and\nthe end of the stairway, where it passed through the north wall\nof the room, has been blocked, so that it is impossible to say\nexactly how the stairs were entered at ground level. But the\nstair shaft (plate 15.3), lit by a small window in the east wall,\npenetrates the south wall of the room 2.65m above the floor;\nthe pitch of the rising vault makes it possible to calculate the\nposition of the top step, emerging in the upper floor.\n\n(tit) Upper floor (fig. 15.4)\n\nFrom the top of the stairs a narrow vaulted passage or corridor\nfollows an angular U-shaped course to give access to all the\nupper floor rooms. It is poorly lit by only one small window just\nabove floor level at the head of the stairs and by borrowed light\nfrom a central stairway from the east — west run of the corridor\nup to the roof of the Haram portico (see below). From the stair-\nhead the corridor continues south to a point above the middle\nof the Haram wall, where it turns west along the top of the wall\n (here 2.40m thick) and reaches the shoulder of Bab Hitta,\nwhere it turns northward and leads to an open landing directly\nabove the entrance portal and vestibule and at the head of the\nmodern staircase.\n\nIt was this landing, at the far end of the corridor, which\ngave access to the principal upper floor room, located directly\nabove the ground floor zwvan. The room is cross-vaulted and has\ntwo windows overlooking the courtyard. Openings in the south\nwall give access to two smaller rooms, both barrel-vaulted. The\neastern of these was originally entered by a door (now\nblocked) close to the head of the stairs; its present door from\nthe principal room is shown by the absence of reveals to be\nsecondary; the room has another door, also secondary,\nopening from the east — west run of the corridor. The walls of\nthese rooms are of unusual thickness, not matched by those at\nground level; we have no explanation of this anomaly.\n\nThe landing, which serves as a porch for these rooms, is\nnow open but was formerly roofed, as is shown by the traces of\nthe springing of a vault at its north-east corner. At the south-\nwest corner there _— re-used pieces of moulding, apparently\nof Crusader origin,” arranged in such a manner as to suggest\n that there was originally an arched opening to the west\noverlooking the street (plate 15.4).\n\nIt emerges, thus, that the main upper floor room was\nreached from the street by a tortuous route across the\ncourtyard of the madrasa, up the stairs and along the U-shaped\ncorridor to arrive at the porch directly over the entrance portal.\nThe layout is logical, however. It lends privacy to the principal\nrooms while affording views of the street and the courtyard of\nthe madrasa. On the way, the passage served other rooms: first,\nfrom the stairhead, after the small room (described above)\nadjacent to the principal room, it passed a double-cross-vaulted\nrectangular room overlooking Birkat Bani Isra’il by windows in\nits north and east walls. In its east — west run the passage is\nabout 1.10m wide and seems to have been cut through the\nrubble core of the upper part of the Haram wall. At its east end\nthere is a latrine recess 1.45m deep; and at the west a\ncontinuation (now partly blocked) which extends over Bab\nHitta itself as far as the western limit of that gate, adjoining the\nAwhadiyya (no. 9). In the north wall of this continuation an\nirregular opening has been made, apparently at some later\ndate, to connect the passage with a room over the northern\n porch of Bab Hitta. This room seems to be an integral part of the\nKarimiyya and not an earlier structure incorporated into it; a\nsmall change in the style of the exterior masonry of its north\nwall (plate 15.5) indicates that it was a later addition built over\nthe roof of the porch. The principal entrance to the room is\nfrom the west side of the northward return of the corridor.\n\nA short flight of nine steps sheltered by a stone canopy\nleads up from the middle of the east — west run of the corridor\nto the originally open roof of the Haram extension — with a fine\nview of the Haram — and from there to the roofs of the upper\nfloor rooms described above. d\n\nA variety of rooms, Ottoman or later, have been built on\nthe roofs of the upper floor rooms of the madrasa and its Haram\nextension.\n HARAM EXTENSION (plan, fig. 15.3)\n\nOne, if not both, of the two alcoves seen in the south wall of the\ntransverse chamber (p. 214 above) must formerly have\npenetrated the wall, for Mujir al-Din lists the Karimiyya as one\nof those madrasas that had direct access to the Haram as well as\na door opening outside it. The distinctive configuration of the\nwestern alcove suggests that it was hewn out of the core of the\nHaram wall. The eastern alcove appears better suited to\naccommodate the four or five steps that would have been\nnecessary to reach the floor of the Haram extension which is\n1.20m above that of the transverse chamber (see fig. 15.6). The\ndrawing of fig. |15.7 shows an opening linked with the eastern\nalcove.\n\nThat the structures south of the Haram wall were regarded\nas part of the Karimiyya is proved by al-‘Umari’s description of\nthe north wall of the Haram (see above). The ‘portico’ seen by\nal-‘Umari had become for Mujir al-Din a ‘majma’ (see above);\nfor both it is part of the Karimiyya. The conversion will have\ntaken place (if simultaneously with the Ghadiriyya Madrasa) in\nor about 836/1432. Al-Umari has more to say of the topography.\nFrom the dimensions he gives it is obvious that in his day the\nland to the east of the Karimiyya Madrasa, between it and the\nspot later occupied by the Bab al-Asbat Minaret (1367-68), was\nopen. In front (a@mdamahda) of the Karimiyya, he says, was a\nportico with two walls, east and west. The length of 25 dhird ‘is\nspecified for the madrasa but in a context (above, p. 104) which\nindicates that it was the length of the portico that was measured.\nAl-‘Umari usually only gives dimensions of the porticoes and\nthe gates, never of the buildings outside the Haram walls. We\nknow from analysis of other dimensions given by al-‘Umari that\nhis dhira‘ equals approximately 0.69-0.70m and so 25 dhira‘\nequals approximately 17.25-17.50m. In fact the present\nstructure in front of the madrasa measures 17.57m from east to\nwest — a sufficiently close correspondence to indicate that it at\nleast occupies the same site as the original portico.\n\nThe west wall of the Haram extension, which blocks the\neastern arch of the south porch of Bab Hitta, appears to belong\nto the original construction (p/ate 15.6). In the centre there is\na rectangular window with a monolithic lintel surmounted by\na tabula ansata frame, probably in re-use and apparently\nintended for an inscription that was never carved. The iron\nwindow grille has large spherical bosses at the intersections, a\ncommon Mamluk feature.\n\nBelow the window a low door opens into a small chamber\nused until recently as a cistern.” It is roughly three metres\neauare and hasasimnple nointed-arched mihrab cut in its south\n wall. Three steps lead down to the plastered floor which is\nabout 1.25m below ground level (fig. 15.6). Flanking the door\nare two stone benches which are probably those described by\nal-‘Umari as ‘abutting the aforementioned Karimiyya’.”\n\nAs for the Haram frontage, bearing in mind that al-‘Umari\nspeaks of an arcade or portico (arwiqa) and not merely a single\narch or bay (generally ‘aqd), we can tentatively restore the\noriginal facade as a portico of three arches as in fig. 15.7.\n\nIn a second phase, following the collapse of that portico,\nthe central arch was restored but those which flanked it were\nreplaced by walls. The plain doorway (now blocked) to the\nwest of the arch and the window to the east belong to this phase\nof construction. The present structure is probably little altered\nfrom that seen by Mujir al-Din. The interior of the hall, now\ndivided by modern partitions, is vaulted in three bays separated\nby distorted transverse arches. The two eastern bays are cross-\n 1 Al-‘Umari, Masdlik, 157.\n\n2 We read here bazat as in Bodleian Ms. Pococke 191, fol. 39b. This has the same\nconsonantal outline as the jarat in the Ms. used by Ahmad Zaki Pasha, although he\nread jawarat for his edition.\n\n3 The exact significance of masifayn here is not clear. The word is explained in\nCl. Denizeau, Dictionnaire des parlers arabes de Syrie, Liban et Palestine, Paris,\n1960, as ‘terrasse de maison (on y dort pendant I’été)’. ‘Before it (quddama-hay,\nwith reference to the madrasa, is replaced in Ms. Pococke 191, loc. cit. supra, by\nquddama-huma’, which can only mean ‘before them’, the two walls. This is\npuzzling, unless al-‘Umari meant ‘in the portico in front of the walls on an east —\n\nwest axis’, as though there were two chambers at either end of that enclosed part\nof the portico.\n\n4 Sijill 1, no. 1363.\n\n5 Mujir, ii, 39-40.\n\n6 Nu.

As at the North Qanatir, the\ncolumns with their bases and acanthus capitals are obviously in\nsecondary use. The piers have cyma recta cornices on the\nspringing line of the arcade and have upward extensions to\ncounteract any residual lateral thrust from the arcade. The\nthree pointed arches of the arcade are alike in height and span.\nThey are quite markedly stilted, apparently in order to match\nthe height of the North Qanatir by compensating for the relative\nshortness of the columns in this colonnade.

The breach in the vault of the south-\nwest corner room has been repaired while the southern part of\nthe upper storey over the Haram portico, which was in a very\npoor condition then, has been demolished. The two large\nwindows in the south wall of that part were similar in\ndecorative treatment to those in the Haram facade (see below,\np. 229), which are surrounded by an elaborately modelled\nframe and were surmounted by panels of ablaq joggling.\n\nThe main south elevation (excluding the upper storey\nover the Haram portico) consists of three ‘storeys,’ each\nconstructed in a different type of masonry: large, heavily bossed\nashlars for the lowest (the substructure supporting the\nmadrasa); small smoother ashlars in the middle ‘storey’; and\nmuch smaller, roughly dressed and coursed masonry at the top.\n\nThe masonry of the lowest of these storeys resembles the\ndistinctive masonry observed in parts of the Ayyabid halls\nincorporated into the Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-Din (see above, p. 121)\nwhere it appears to be in re-use. Here the masonry is\nhomogeneous and is most probably Crusader. The wall is\nstrengthened by two buttresses which have sloping tops — a\nfeature first employed in the Holy Land by the Crusaders. Three\npointed arches at the base of the wall open into a series of vaults\nunder the madrasa. These await detailed investigation. They\nmay have served to support some buildings that previously\noccupied the site of the Tankiziyya. They are not part of the\ngreat causeway which carries the street in front of the\nTankiziyya entrance across the town’s central (‘Tyropoeon’)\nvalley, but abut against part of that causeway, which dates from\nHerodian times and of which the easternmost arch survives,\nnow called ‘Wilson’s Arch’,\n\nThe southern boundary and part of the western boundary\nof the madrasa coincide with the boundaries of these pre-\nexisting substructures (see below, p. 232). The interior layout\nis not related to the substructures, as the best available plan of\nthem (fig. 18.8), made in 1966 and based on Warren’s survey of\n1868, shows.!\n\nThe two upper storeys of masonry form the south wall of\nwhat is a single storey madrasa; the two tiers of windows light\nindividual rooms. The lower storey is built in the larger,\nsmoothly dressed ashlar and the upper one, set back slightly, is\nbuilt of smaller, less carefully dressed stones.\n WEST ELEVATION\n\nThere is no west facade as such, only the external wall of the\nsouth-west corner room of the madrasa being exposed on this\nside. This wall is structurally homogeneous with the south wall\nand shares the same three ‘storeys’ of masonry. Fig. 18.9 shows\nthat this wall appears to abut on an earlier structure to the\nnorth, thereby partly blocking a window.\n\nHARAM PORTICO (fig. 18.6, plate 18.1).\n\nThe portico supporting part of the upper floor of the Tankiziyya\nwas built, as an inscription’ in the Haram wall testifies, in 713/\n1313-14 as the second stage in the construction of the west\nportico by Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad. Al-‘Umari’s description\n(see above) establishes that only the first nine bays of the\nportico south of Bab al-Silsila were standing in his day. The\nsouthward continuation is a later construction, completed\nsome time before 1483 when Erhard Reuwich included it in his\npanorama of the Haram.’ The six granite columns are no longer\nin place, but it is interesting to note that the eighth pier of the\nportico described by al-Umari appears to incorporate an\nearlier pier which, to judge from the tooling of the stone, is\nentirely Crusader (plate 12.1). The second to sixth piers are all\nreinforced with sloping-topped buttresses that are evidently\nlater additions (see below).\n\n There are five openings in the Haram wall under the\nportico: one door and four windows. Of these the\nsouthernmost is the small door in the ninth (last) bay of the\nportico that must correspond to the door which, according to\nal-‘Umarti, ‘gives access to the roof of the madrasa and the living\nquarters of the Sifis’ (see above, p. 223). It is now blocked but\npresumably it opened into a staircase rising northwards within\nthe thickness of the Haram wall to the roof of the portico. From\nthere a narrow passageway spanning the corner between the\nwest wall of the Haram and the south wall of the madrasa (fig.\n18.3) interconnects the roof of the portico with that of the\nmadrasa (see upper floor plan, fig. 18.5). Mujir al-Din lists the\nTankiziyya as one of those buildings that could be entered from\ninside and outside the Haram.”\n\nTo the north of the door are two windows (now blocked)\nthat opened in the rear wall of the east Zwdan of the madrasa.\nThe other two windows are smaller and at a higher level. One\nbelongs to the north-east corner room of the madrasa, and the\nother lights the entrance vestibule (see plan, fig. 18.3).\n\nHARAM FACADE (fig. 18.6, plate 18.1)\n\nThe facade of the upper floor over the portico has undergone\nseveral alterations. The small paired segmental-arched\nwindows of the northern room (marked ‘K’ on the upper floor\nplan, fig. 18.5) have the appearance of having been built or\nrebuilt during the Ottoman period. Their construction must,\nhowever, have been before 1865, for an Ordnance Surve\nphotograph taken in that year shows the present disposition.\nThe same photograph shows that the southern extension of the\n\n9\n upper floor (see above), demolished some time after 1914,>°\nhad a large rectangular window which matched the two\navenae windows each surrounded by a deeply moulded\nframe.’ The rough patching of the masonry above the\nmoulded lintels of two remaining windows undoubtedly\nresults from the removal of a panel of joggled inlay (plate 18.2)\nsimilar to those over the windows in the south facade (above,\np. 228, fig. 18.9).\n made in lo/g\n\nPaired pointed-arched windows in the centre of the facade\nhave been partly blocked to leave rectangular openings, more\nreadily fitted with glazing (plate 18.3). The arches composed of\nblack and white ablaq voussoirs are supported by two re-used\ncolumns and by curious elbow brackets cantilevered from a\ncentral pier between the openings. How extensively these\nwindows have been altered is not clear. The wagqfiyya (see\nabove, p. 225) states that the arches were supported, not by two\n columns and a central pier, but by three columns. A stone in the\ncommon spandrel between the two arches bears a repeating\ntrefoil motif carved in low relief that matches the pattern carved\nin masonry above the lintel of a window in the Haram frontage\nof the ‘Uthmaniyya (plate 57.2). Similarly decorated stones\nhave been re-used in the south wall of the Khatiniyya courtyard\n(below, p. 346) and in the soffit of a stair window in the\nAshrafiyya. Presumably they were taken from some part of the\n‘Uthmaniyya. The stone between the arches of the Tankiziyya\ntestifies to some not inconsiderable rebuilding of the paired\nwindows, perhaps during the repairs proposed in 984/1576-77\n(see above, p. 228).\n\nThe arches of the first three bays of the portico south of\nBab al-Silsila also show clear signs of rebuilding (see plate\n18.1). And the buttresses strengthening all the portico piers\nunder this part of the Tankiziyya are obviously later additions:\nthey extend irregularly up the facade and, at the sixth pier from\nBab al-Silsila, the buttress encroaches on the moulding around\none of the assembly hall windows.\n STREET FACADE (plate 18.4)\n\nThe striking entrance portal is the principal feature of the street\nfacade. The portal recess is set in a wall of finely dressed ashlars,\nwhich abuts to the east on the Ayyibid outer porch at Bab al-\nSilsila (plate 18.5). To the west, the same masonry extends a\n similar distance from the centre of the portal to create a\nsymmetrical composition. A cyma recta moulding extends\nacross the facade above the keystone of the portal. It stops\nagainst the outer porch at Bab al-Silsila and ends abruptly a\n similar distance from the centre line of the portal to the west,\ndefining the limits of this symmetrical ‘portal facade’. Such a\npreoccupation with symmetry seems to have been a particular\ncharacteristic of Damascene builders during the Mamlik\nperiod (see above, p. 85).\n\nThe western limit of the portal facade is defined by a\nshallow return of 0.02m in the masonry. The lower masonry\ncoursing continues to the west, past this return, to include four\ndeep recesses opening for the whole of their width on the\nstreet. These recesses can only have been intended for the\nshops (a purpose they serve to this day, see plate 18.6)\nproviding income for the upkeep of the Tankiziyya (see above,\np. 228 n. 40). The symmetry of the portal facade is upset by a\nrecess to the east of the portal (shown blocked up in plate 18.7\nbut now fitted with steel doors), which lacks a proper lintel and\nappears not to be part of the original construction but rather a\nlate insertion to serve as a small shop or stall.\n\nAbove the cyma moulding the masonry of the facade is\ndistinctly different, resembling that of the upper ‘storey’ of the\nsouth and west facades. This is the facade of that part of the\nupper floor which sits over the northern part of the madrasa. It\nterminates 1.48m short of the outer porch at Bab al-Silsila to\nleave a balcony (now fitted with a screen of iron bars) allowing\nlight and fresh air to penetrate the rooms to the east and south.\nOf three windows in this upper facade, the west one appears to\nbe a later insertion (the waqfiyya mentions only two windows,\nsee above, p. 225) and the east one has been modified and\ngiven a semicircular arch (plate 18.4). The jambs of the middle\nwindow course through with the adjoining masonry and it\nappears to be unmodified.\n ENTRANCE PORTAL (plate 18.7)\n\nThe portal consists of a deep recess crowned by three tiers of\nmugqarnas corbelling supporting a pointed semidome that is\ndistinctively decorated with chevron fluting radiating from\nthree centres (plate 18.8).** Stone benches on each side of the\nrecess return on the west side (and originally also on the east\nSide) across the face to the limits of the portal facade. Tankiz’s\nblazon” ~a chalice on an undivided circular field — is repeated\nthrice within the inscription band, once above the doorway and\nonce on each side of the recess. Below the inscription a panel\nof joggled ablag inlay (recently repaired) decorates the back\nwall over the monolithic door lintel. In a corresponding\nposition above the inscription band there is another panel of\ncurvilinear ablaq joggling, rather more elaborate than the\nlower one.\n\nThe Jami’ Tankiz in Damascus, built for Tankiz in 717/\n1317-18,™ has two monumental portals which closely resemble\nthe portal of the Tankiziyya in Jerusalem, both having three\ntiers of similar muqarnas corbelling supporting a semidome\nwith chevron fluting. The similarities between the doorways\nare so striking that there can be little doubt that the earlier\ndoorways in Damascus (plate 18.9) inspired the one in\nJerusalem. Indeed, despite eleven years’ difference in time\n between the two constructions, the same builders may have\nbeen responsible for all three.\n ee eee ee ee ee ee ee ae\n\nbeen responsible for all three.\n\nGROUND FLOOR (fig. 18.3)\n\nThe entrance doorway leads into a cross-vaulted vestibule. A\ndeep tunnel-vaulted recess to the east of the vestibule is lit by a\nwindow in the Haram wall (p/ate 18.10). The area to the north\nof this barrel-vaulted extension, between it and the porch at\nBab al-Silsila, is inaccessible. It would appear that it was entered\nfrom the north, and it might be connected with shops\nmentioned in the notice of appointment dated 1018/1609-10\n(see above, p. 228 n. 40). A grilled window that opens from this\narea north on the Bab al-Silsila porch is now largely obscured\nby a modern bookstall (plate 18.11).\n\nThe staircase to the mezzanine and upper floor rises\nagainst the south wall of the vestibule. An inscription in that\nwall, above the foot of the stairs (see plate 18.10), records\nrestorations made in the 1920s.\n The vestibule was made co-axial with the interior of the\nmadrasa. A door in its south wall opens in the middle of the\nback wall of the north ivdin (plate 18.12). Each of the ivéins is\ncross-vaulted, and the courtyard, square in plan, is roofed in a\nnovel fashion with a multi-faceted or ‘folded’ cross vault rising\nto an octagonal oculus at the crown. Under the oculus an\noctagonal stone basin” occupying the centre of the courtyard\n(plate 18.13) contains a fountain in the middle and is\nsurrounded by a shallow trough to catch spillage. A\nsemicircular niche in its north side reaffirms the gibla\n orientation of the mibrab. Rainwater passing through the\noculus, or compluvium, would fall into the basin/impluvium.\nVan Berchem” avers that water thus collected was piped into\nthe main aqueduct (restored by Tankiz) running down Tariq\nBab al-Silsila to the Haram, but this is improbable. The average\nannual rainfall in Jerusalem is 560mm with a maximum\nmonthly average of 120mm, which means that the quantity of\nwater that could be collected in the basin is negligible —\nscarcely enough ever to fill it, in fact. The piped connection\nwith the main aqueduct was really for the purpose of supplying\nwater to the fountain, as the wagfiyya implies (above, p. 225).\nThe oculus was to give light and ventilation.\n\nThe plain stone paving of the floor appears to be largely\noriginal though the wagfiyya states that the floor was paved in\nmarble. Charles Wilson noted in 1865 that ‘the building appears\nat one time to have been richly decorated, but now the marble\npaving is fast disappearing’.*’ He must have been alluding to the\nmarble dado that originally ran round all the walls of the\nmadrasa but now remains only in the south zwdan (plate 18.13).\nSome of the marble panelling from the dado has been re-used\nto pave the floor of the south-east corner room (plate 18.14).\nThe only marble in the floor of the madrasa is in the mibrab,\nwhere the polychrome paving is flush with the plain stone\npaving of the zwan.\n The four zwans opening off the courtyard are of varying\ndepths, mainly as a result of restrictions imposed upon the\nbuilders by the site. The site is limited to the east by the Haram\nwall; to the south by the boundary of the pre-existing\nsubstructure; to the west partly by the boundary of that\nsubstructure and partly by what must be regarded as the\nremains of an earlier building (AD); and to the north by the\nstreet alignment and the southern abutment of the Ayyibid\nporch at Bab al-Silsila. The south izvdn is the deepest (7.28m),\nas is usually the case (but see below, p. 427), and has two\nwindows flanking the mibrab in the centre of its south wall.\nAbove the mibrab is a third, pointed-arched window. The east\niwan is only marginally less deep (6.92m) than the south one.\nIt has symmetrically disposed windows in its back (east) wall,\nwhich opened under the portico. The north and west iwéans are\nreduced in depth compared with the other two. The space\navailable for the north iwdn is restricted by the vestibule and\nentrance portal, while the depth of the west zwéin is curtailed by\nthe pre-existing structure to the west.\n\nThis structure consisted of a group of rooms reached\n through a door in the west wall of the west zwdn. The break in\nbond and the heterogeneous masonry of the two walls next to\nthe window of room ‘A’, visible in Salzmann’s 1854 photograph\n(see fig. 18.9) but subsequently rebuilt as shown on the plan\n(fig. 18.3), leave little doubt that rooms ‘A’ and ‘D’ belong to that\npre-existing structure. The large purposeless block of masonry\nbetween room ‘A’ and the south-west corner room of the\nmadrasa shows that the Mamliik builders felt obliged to\nmaintain the regularity of the four-fwdn layout rather than\nattempt to make use of this awkward corner which they must\nsimply have filled with rubble when they connected the\nmadrasa to the pre-existing structure to the west. The folded\n cross vault of room ‘A’ must surely have been built at the time\nof construction of the Tankiziyya,® implying that the original\nvaulting had collapsed. The octagonal recess at the crown was\noriginally open (see fig. 18.7). Two barrel-vaulted chambers (B\nand C) in the north wall of room ‘A’ now house latrines; their\noriginal purpose is not known. Room ‘D’ is reached through a\nwide doorway in the west wall of ‘A’.\n\nThe south-west corner room of the madrasa has two doors\ncommunicating with the adjoining iwédns, and the south-east\ncorner room has a door into the south ivén and a grilled\nwindow into the east zwdn. Each has a rectangular grilled\nwindow in its south wall, surmounted by a pointed-arched\nwindow (see fig. 18.9). The south-west room has a similar pair\nof superposed windows in its west wall. A fireplace (plate\n18.15) in the south wall of the south-east room appears to be a\nlater refinement, added probably in the Ottoman period.\n\nThe barrel-vaulted northern corner rooms are much\nsmaller than the cross-vaulted southern corner rooms. The\nnorth-east One, entered from the east iwdn, occupies the\ncorner between the staircase and the Haram wall. The north-\nwest one, entered from the west zwdn, has a grilled window\nopening into the north zwdn. It is very small: its size was\nrestricted by the presence of the shops to the north, described\nabove, p. 230; the reason for its limited westerly development\nis unclear.\n\n SETTING OUT OF THE PLAN\n\nThinking in terms of what the architect had to contend with on\nthe site, it seems that he must have prepared some sort of\n room\n\nsketch plan, perhaps simply by pacing out the boundaries,\nbefore work on the site commenced. Unlike Cairo, where the\nMamluk builders as often as not had virgin ground to build on,\nin Mamluk Jerusalem the site was almost invariably bounded by\nexisting structures and was frequently strewn with the remains\nof earlier buildings. A decision would need to be reached at the\noutset on whether or not all or part of these remains were to be\nretained and incorporated into the new building. When, as in\nthe case of the Tankiziyya, that new building had to conform to\na preconceived formal layout — that of a four-iwdan madrasa —\nthe difficulties of deciding what existing remains could be\nretained while fitting the preconceived layout within the limits\nof an irregular site surely could not have been overcome\nwithout some sort of sketch plan of the site.\n\nHaving satisfactorily fitted the four-iwan plan within the\nconfines of the site as delineated in the sketch, the architect\ncould then order the levelling of the site, leaving those\nstructures he wished to retain. That done, the marking out of\n the foundations on the levelled site could proceed, presumably\nusing quicklime as was evidently customary at that time.\n\nNo sketch plans have survived from the Mamluk period,\nand this suggests that such sketches were only drawn in some\nimpermanent way, with a stick on the ground for instance, or\nwith chalk on a slate which could be wiped clean afterwards.\n\nINTERIOR DECORATION\n\nThe marble wall panelling in the south ivdn (plate 18.16)\nincluding the mibrab (plate 18.17), is particularly noteworthy.\nThe lower parts of the walls of the other zzvams are set back to\na depth of 0.10m, showing that the marble dado originally ran\naround all the walls of the madrasa. Marble wall panelling is\nrare in Jerusalem, and the way it is treated here bears such a\nclose resemblance to the panelling in the Aqsa Mosque”! and in\nthe Haram at Hebron,” both ordered by Tankiz and completed\nin 731/1330-31% and 732/1331-32\" respectively, that one can\nscarely fail to conclude that all three examples are the work of\nthe same team of specialists. This team presumably came from\n Syria where repairs to the Great Mosque in Damacus, including\na new mibrab and marble panelling (no longer extant) were\ncompleted on 26 Safar 729/30 December 1328.° Having\ncompleted that work, it seems likely that this team was brought\nto Jerusalem where by this time the construction of the\nTankiziyya was far enough advanced to permit the marble-\nworkers to begin on the interior. They were subsequently\ncommissioned to decorate the Aqsa Mosque and the Haram in\nHebron.\n\nTraces of a star-pattern polychrome marble inlay in the sill\n of the west window in the south zwdn (plate 18.18) bear\nsufficiently close resemblance to similar traces (plate 24.30) in\nthe floor of Hammam al-‘Ayn, also built by Tankiz (see below,\np. 291) to suggest that the same marble-workers were\nemployed there also.\n\nIn particular, the mibradb of the Tankiziyya is virtually\nidentical with the one in Hebron, having a band of blind\narcading® at the base surmounted by a lining of tall narrow\nstrips of polychrome marble, and flanked by two re-used\nCrusader columns with matching capitals and bases. The\ndistinctive marble inlay around the conch, with interlacing\nsemicircular lobes on the haunches interconnecting with\ngeometric strapwork on the _spandrels, is, as is generally\nagreed, typically North Syrian,’ and the craftsmen responsible\nmay have originated there. The conchs of both mibrabs are\ndecorated with glass mosaics, probably from stock made\nDo ahs Tema WAR ey A ASU NE SIA ERIN Rs ALLY DALE SEE GFARM an SoBe ka Sing Sey oN\n Al-Tankiziyya\n\noriginally for the restoration of the mosaics at the Great\nMosque in Damascus and partly used, as al-‘Umari states, for\ndecorating the gibla wall of the Jami‘ Tankiz (717/1317-18).™\nThe mosaicists therefore probably came from Damascus. It is\nunlikely that there were expert mosaicists in Jerusalem at that\ntime — if there were there is no evidence of their work; the\nearlier restoration of the mosaics on the Dome of the Rock\nunder Baybars (c.662/1264)® was probably done by\nDamascene mosaicists too, ” and possibly also the restoration\nunder Kitbugha (695/1295-96).”\n\nFurther evidence of the splendid interior decoration of\nthe original building may be seen ina beautiful enamelled glass\nlamp, now in the Islamic Museum on the Haram, which bears\nan inscription stating that it was for the madrasa of Tankiz (bi-\nrasm madrasat ... Tankiz).”\n\nMEZZANINE (plan, fig. 18.4)\n\nThe staircase to the upper floors rises against the south wall of\nthe vestibule before turning south then east to the upper floor.\nThe mezzanine is entered directly off the staircase, without a\nlanding, just after the stairs turn east. It comprises four rooms\n(E-H) linked to the staircase by a corridor (plate 18.19). The\ndoor into room ‘E’ to the east of the corridor is now blocked.\nRoom F opens for its full width off the corridor like a small\niwdan, and room ‘G’ opposite it appears originally to have been\nsimilar but that opening has been partly blocked to leave a\nnarrower door (plate 18.20). The northern room (H), entered\nfrom the north end of the corridor (p/ate 18.21), has a small\ngrilled window opening north under the porch at Bab al-Silsila\n(see plate 18.11). The area to the west of ‘H’ is inaccessible;\nthere is no sign of a blocked opening into it except for a\nblocked circular window in the west face of the southern\nabutment of the outer porch at Bab al-Silsila (see plate 18.5).\nThe other rooms (E, F and G) have no windows and are lit and\nventilated by an air shaft issuing above the north end of the\ncorridor.\n\nUPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 18.5)\n\nAs we know from the nearly contemporary account of al-‘Umari\n(above, p. 223), the upper floor housed the Tankiziyya\nKhanqah. All the rooms at this level are vaulted, though the\nwadgfiyya states that those over the Haram portico had timber\nroofs (above, p. 225). This suggests that their vaulting is later,\nperhaps part of the repairs authorized in 984/1576-77 (see\nabove, p. 228).\n\nThe khanqah may be regarded as comprising two parts: an\neastern part over the Haram portico and a western part over the\nmezzanine and north end of the madrasa. The eastern part\nconsists of three large halls (the southernmost of which no\nlonger retains its original form), which would have\naccommodated the communal and ritual activities of the Sifis.\nThe rooms in the western part are built on a smaller scale,\nevidently intended for their lodgings.\n\nThe main staircase rises past the mezzanine to lead\ndirectly into the central hall (J) over the portico. The top of the\nstairs were originally sheltered by a little porch (see fig. 18.9).\nHall J, described as an wan in the wagfiyya, overlooks the\nHaram through paired windows (described above, p. 229)\ncentred ona pier of the supporting portico. It serves as a sort of\ncovered courtyard interconnecting the various components of\nthe khanqah: a door in its west wall, beside the staircase (see\nplate 18.22), leads to the western rooms (L-S); and doorways in\nthe north and south walls lead to the two other halls over the\nportico, the council chamber (K) to the north and the assembly\nhall (now partitioned) to the south.\n\nAn assembly hall (majma‘) seems to have been an\nessential feature of khangahs in Jerusalem (though evidently\nnot elsewhere) where Sufis could perform their religious\nexercises. ° This one, like those at the Dawadariyya (no. 8) and\nthe Is‘ardiyya (no. 33), was divided into three bays, each with a\nwindow overlooking the Haram to the east. The southern bay\nwas demolished some time after 1914 (above, p. 229). The wall\n ventilated Dy an air Shalt issuing above the north end of the\ncorridor.\n\nUPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 18.5)\n\nAs we know from the nearly contemporary account of al-‘Umari\n(above, p. 223), the upper floor housed the Tankiziyya\nKhanqah. All the rooms at this level are vaulted, though the\nwadgfiyya states that those over the Haram portico had timber\nroofs (above, p. 225). This suggests that their vaulting is later,\nperhaps part of the repairs authorized in 984/1576-77 (see\nabove, p. 228).\n\nThe khanqah may be regarded as comprising two parts: an\neastern part over the Haram portico and a western part over the\nmezzanine and north end of the madrasa. The eastern part\nconsists of three large halls (the southernmost of which no\nlonger retains its original form), which would have\naccommodated the communal and ritual activities of the Sifis.\nThe rooms in the western part are built on a smaller scale,\nevidently intended for their lodgings.\n\nThe main staircase rises past the mezzanine to lead\ndirectly into the central hall (J) over the portico. The top of the\nstairs were originally sheltered by a little porch (see fig. 18.9).\nHall J, described as an wan in the wagfiyya, overlooks the\nHaram through paired windows (described above, p. 229)\ncentred on a pier of the supporting portico. It serves as a sort of\ncovered courtyard interconnecting the various components of\nthe khanqah: a door in its west wall, beside the staircase (see\nplate 18.22), leads to the western rooms (L-S); and doorways in\nthe north and south walls lead to the two other halls over the\nportico, the council chamber (K) to the north and the assembly\nhall (now partitioned) to the south.\n\nAn assembly hall (majma‘) seems to have been an\nessential feature of khangahs in Jerusalem (though evidently\nnot elsewhere) where Stfis could perform their religious\nexercises. ° This one, like those at the Dawadariyya (no. 8) and\nthe Is‘ardiyya (no. 33), was divided into three bays, each with a\nwindow overlooking the Haram to the east. The southern bay\nwas demolished some time after 1914 (above, p. 229). The wall\n Flate 16.c2 OOUIN Wall OF TOO v\nseparating the northern and central bays is obviously a later\ninsertion, and the south wall of the central bay must have been\nintroduced when the southern bay was demolished. Of course,\nno mibrab survives but we know from the wag@fiyya that there\nwas one between the two windows in the south wall (as shown\nin the dotted plan reconstruction, fig. 18.5). In addition to the\nwindows in the east and south walls there were three windows\nin the west wall and another giving on the roof of the madrasa,\naccording to the waqfiyya (above, p. 225). Now there are two\ndoors in the west wall. The secondary staircase, leading up to\nthe roof from under the Haram portico (see above, p. 229),\nmust have issued just to the south of the south-west corner of\nthe southern bay of the assembly hall.\n\nTo the north of hall ‘JJ is the council chamber (K), with\npointed-arched recesses in all four sides and a central folded\ncross-vault. The waqfiyya seems to confuse halls ‘J’ and ‘K’ for\nit has two doors opening west from ‘K’ when in reality they\nopen from J’. The first of these is the staircase entrance. The\nsecond, to the north of the first (plate 18.22) leads into the\n western rooms ‘L-S’. The mezzanine air shaft forms a central\ncore round which the rooms above the mezzanine are\ngrouped. Those to the west of the air shaft are cross-vaulted (M\nand N), and those to the south-east and north-east (L and O)\nhave folded cross vaults, while that to the east (P) is now\ninaccessible, though its shallow pierced dome can be seen\nfrom the roof (plate 18.23). This difference is for practical\nreasons of lighting and ventilation. Whereas the rooms to the\nwest of the shaft have windows opening either on the roof of\nthe madrasa or on the balcony, the three rooms to the east have\nno outside walls for windows. Folded cross vaults provide the\npossibility of openings in the roof for lighting and ventilation.\nAs the plan (fig. 18.5) shows, the openings in the roof of the\nthree rooms vary in size and shape: a small dome (plate 18.24)\nover room ‘O’ supported on an eight-sided drum with a\nwindow in each side, pointed-arched with gadroon voussoirs\non the exterior; and a rectangular skylight covered by a hutch-\nlike cowl with openings to north and south (see plate 18.23)\nover room ‘L’. Between these the roof of room ‘P’ has multiple\nperforations mostly filled with glass — a feature usually found\nonly in the domes of bath-houses — which may indicate that this\nroom was originally a small bammdam for the use of the inmates\nof the khanqah.\n\nA corridor leads west from room ‘M’ past a barrel-vaulted\n room (Q), which has a circular window in its north wall\noverlooking the balcony, to the two rooms (R and S) over the\nmain entrance. The first of these (R), roofed by two cross vaults,\noverlooks the little square at Bab al-Silsila through a window in\nits north wall, and is connected with room ‘Q’ to the east by a\n Notes\n\n1 WF.

After the completion of the\nTankiziyya almost every major Mamlik construction had a folded cross vault, and\nthe implication is that these vaults were modelled on the ones in the Tankiziyya.\n59 For a discussion of Muslim architects’ plans see: EMA, i*, 109-11; R.

Only an expert could have devised this sophisticated scheme\nwhereby the suspended impost is held in place by being extended upwards to\nform the keystone of a segmental relieving arch. Perhaps it appeared at the time\nto be over-ambitious (although there is a series of earlier suspended imposts\nwhich still survive in Damascus and Jerusalem: see above, p. 157) for, as it happens\nthe ‘suspended imposts’ on the facade of this tomb are merely corbelled from the\nback walls of the window recesses —a much simpler, though mundane, solution.\n61 RW.

The archivolt of the trefoil arch\nis curved to form one large cavetto. Little brackets in the form\nof ‘folded’ pendentives adjust the cavetto of the lowest\nvoussoirs to the square corners of the recess.\n\nTo the right of the entrance is a small window lighting\nchamber ‘P’. Further to the right is a small door surmounted by\na window opening into the room marked ‘O’ on the plan, Jig.\n19.3. This room is, as a vertical joint in the masonry shows, a\nlater addition. To the left of the entrance is a plain rectangular\nwindow lighting the corridor.\n\nThe masonry of the street frontage continues round the\ncorner onto the west side of the square to abut on the north-\neast corner of the Sa‘diyya (no. 13). In the corner is a plain\nrectangular doorway surmounted by a small window which\nopens into the western part of the ribat (see plate 13.5).\n\nThere are several windows in the upper part of the\nfrontage which light rooms on two upper floors. These upper\nfloors have not been surveyed. A small change in the dressing\nof masonry of the frontage seems to indicate that they do not\n belong to the original foundation. A window above the mibrab\nof the Baladiyya (see below, p. 449), built around 782/1380,\noriginally opened on the area now occupied by buildings on\nthe first floor and this too suggests that the upper floors are\nlater additions. Furthermore, the open staircase (see plate 19.2)\nto the first floor rises against the wall containing the present\nentrance to the Baladiyya, which appears to have been erected\nnot earlier than 875/1470 (see below, p. 447). It is very unlikely\nthat the staircase was built before that wall and consequently it\nmay reasonably be supposed that the first floor (on the roof of\nthe ground floor) was added some time after 875/1470. Since\nthe trefoil arched portal rises about 1.90m above the crowns of\nthe vaults of the ribat, the upper part of the frontage must\n\noriginally have stood as a high (approx. 1.50m) parapet wall on\nthe roof.\n\nINTERIOR (plan, fig. 19.3)\nThe entrance portal opens into a corridor that gives access to\nthe various rooms of the ribat. A modern plywood lining covers\n\npe ly yoo b DUR or rie reas CRIN cpp ctl eats\n possible to say whether or not the northern rooms (Q-V) once\nopened directly on the square and were subsequently isolated\nfrom it by the construction of the wall that forms the present\nstreet frontage, as the notable lack of regularity in the plan\nmight suggest. The vaulting of the rooms is without\nconsistency: some have barrel vaults, others cross vaults. Uae\nnorthern range of rooms is lit only indirectly by the windows in\nthe street frontage.\nIn the north-east corner of room ‘Q’ traces of an earlier\nwall may be seen (see plan). This room has been connected to\nthe adjoining room ‘R’ by the demolition of the common wall.\nRoom ‘S’ has a window into the corridor; it is entered from\ntoom \'T’ to the west. Room ‘T’ (now containing a latrine) gives\naccess to room ‘U’, which has a window in its south wall.\n The west end of the corridor is blocked by a modern wall\nof concrete blocks. Now the area to the west is reached by the\ndoorway at the north-west corner of the square at Bab al-Silsila/\nBab al-Sakina. The main rooms in this area are more\ngenerously proportioned. A barrel-vaulted hall (Y) gives access\nto them. The square recess at the crown of the vault of the hall\nmay once have been open to admit light and provide\nventilation. On the north side of the hall is the window into\nroom ‘U’ and two doors into a large room (V) roofed by two\ncross vaults and now divided by a partition wall. A lower barrel-\nvaulted recess (W) opens to the west from the hall. A small\nroom (X) and an wan open on the south side of the hall. There\nis nothing in the present structure that corresponds obviously\nwith the second ivan mentioned in the wagfiyya (above, p.\n 225). The area to the west of the hall may, however, originally\nhave formed part of the ribat, as suggested by the document\ndated 984/1576 cited above (p. 225), though there is no sign of\na door from the hall into this area.\n\nIn the south-east corner of the complex is a small chamber\n(P) which is no longer easily accessible. Its plan (see fig. 19.3)\nwas drawn from measurements taken through the high-level\nwindow in its south wall. The original entrance from the east is\nblocked by a modern concrete wall. The keeper of the\nadjoining storeroom (O) informed us that one of the recesses\nin its north wall contains a well-head. (The floor is now overlaid\nwith debris.) This must be where, according to the wadgfiyya\n(above, p. 225), Tankiz built a structure housing a stone basin\nand a grille through which water was drawn from a cistern\nbelow.\n ','STREET FRONTAGE, INTERIOR'),(21,'HARAM FAGADE (fig. 21.6, plate 21.1)\n\nThe ground floor frontage is now concealed behind the Haram\nportico which was blocked up some time in the Ottoman\nperiod to provide classrooms for a later madrasa (called the\nAs‘adiyya) founded by an ancestor of Shaykh As‘ad al-Imam, the\npresent householder. Under the portico the original frontage\ncan be seen to be just as al-‘Umari describes it: ‘two windows,\none of them open...” The first window, belonging to the\ntomb chamber, is the larger and is closed with an iron grille.\nThe second one opens as a door into the zwvén (shown in\nsection, fig. 21.7). Apart from these two openings the frontage\nunder the portico is featureless (plate 21.5).\n\nIn contrast, the upper facade over the portico is elaborate.\nThere are five windows disposed symmetrically about a vertical\naxis which is aligned almost centrally on Bab al-‘Atm. The\nmiddle windows are arranged as a group of three and the outer\nwindows are set in pointed-arched recesses on either side. The\nleft-hand (westernmost) window had been converted into a\ndoor which now serves as the main entrance to the upper floors\n(shown in section, fig. 21.7). A clumsy staircase, added some\ntime before 1865,° obstructs two bays of the portico as it rises\nfrom the Haram esplanade to this upper entrance. The\nsupporting structures of the staircase incorporate a plain\nmibrab belonging to the As‘adiyya.\n\nOriginally both the outer windows on the upper facade\nwere identical. Their essential features are preserved better\nover the right-hand (eastern) window: a white marble lintel\nsurmounted by a limestone relieving lintel carved to receive an\nornamental inlay of imitation voussoirs (which has\ndisappeared) and, above, a bevelled oculus which pierces the\ntympanum of the arched recess (plate 21.2).\n\nThe fine triple-arched window in the centre of the facade\nhas recently been restored. The central arch is greater in span\nand height than the flanking ones; all three are constructed in\nablag of alternately red and cream-coloured voussoirs. They\nare supported on six marble columns, recently disengaged\nfrom secondary masonry additions around the windows (see\nplates 21.1 and 21.2). The paired columns at either side of the\nwindows have double capitals decorated with stylized\nacanthus; the single columns supporting the central arch have\n‘thick leaf capitals. Both types of capital appear to be re-used\nCrusader pieces.\n\nThe original height of the western part of the facade is\ndefined by the line of a billet moulding, some stones of which\nhave been re-used to outline the vertical side of a late\n\nconstruction above it. The wall over the central and eastern part\nof the facade is a modern parapet.\n Since the buildings to the east and west of the Aminiyya —\nthe Basitiyya Madrasa (no. 53) and the Farisiyya Madrasa (no.\n30) respectively — are later, that part of the Aminiyya built over\nthe Haram portico must initially have been freestanding over\nBab al-‘Atm. Vertical masonry joints at the extremities of the\nfacade indicate its original extent, which corresponds to three\nbays of the portico below.\n\nSTREET FRONTAGE\n\nThis is merely a wall partly concealed by the later vaulting\nalluded to previously (pp. 157 and 302) which on this side of\nthe street is supported by buttresses. There is a humble\nentrance door devoid of ornament (plate 21.3) and a narrow\nwindow at ground floor level, and another three windows at\nmezzanine level. This utter plainness demonstrates the\nimportance accorded to the Haram facade in marked contrast\nto the adjacent Dawadariyya Khangah (no. 8) where the main\nfacade is on the street and the Haram facade was restricted, as\nwe have shown, to an insignificant frontage under the portico.\n\nGROUND FLOOR (plan, fig. 21.3)\n\nThe entrance from Tariq Bab al-‘Atm leads into a vestibule with\ndoors now opening in all directions: south into the tomb\nchamber, west into the zvdén and north into a short passage\nconnecting with the central courtyard. Of these doors, one, the\nwestern, is not original; as the coarseness of its construction\nshows, it is merely a later breach in the wall to allow direct\naccess to the iwéin. Likewise a later opening is the door in the\nnorth wall of the passage. In other words, the vestibule was\noriginally part of a bent entrance to the courtyard. A large\nsemicircular window above the door into the courtyard (plate\n21.4) was to admit light from the courtyard into the passage and\nvestibule. Originally the courtyard was open to the sky. It has\n subsequently been covered with a lime concrete slab at the\nupper level to provide a backyard for rooms added to the north\nof the development over the Haram portico. As a result the\ninterior of the madrasa is now very dark.\n\nA sunken basin 1.03m square, presumably intended to\nhold rainwater, occupies the centre of the courtyard. The\ndisposition of the cells and staircase around the courtyard is\nshown on the plan (fig. 21.3). The doors in the east and west\nwalls are arranged more or less symmetrically at the corners.\nThe fact that the door at the south-west corner is not exactly\nopposite the one at the south-east corner must be taken as\nanother indication of the existence of the rock scarp there. The\ndoor in the north wall is placed axially, opposite the zwan.\n\nNot directly accessible from the courtyard are a cell in the\nnorth-west corner and a passageway in the north-east corner of\nthe complex. The door of the north-western cell is placed\nawkwardly in juxtaposition with the winders at the foot of the\nstaircase. The entrance to the passageway is from the cell at the\nnorth-eastern corner of the courtyard. This passageway led\nnorth, but it is blocked now, rendering the area to the north\ninaccessible.\n\nThe zwéin, two steps up from the courtyard, is partly cross-\nvaulted and partly barrel-vaulted. It extends south to the Haram\nwall where the small window mentioned by al-‘Umari (above,\np. 249) opens into the portico. This window, despite its\ncomparatively high sill (see section, fig. 21.7), serves as a door\nand must have done so since at least the end of the ninth/\nfifteenth century when Mujir al-Din* lists the Aminiyya as\nhaving direct access to the Haram.\n\nOn the west side of the zvdn there is a narrow unlit cell,\nand on the east side an opening into the tomb chamber. The\ntomb chamber has only the indication of a burial, a flat stone\ncenotaph. At the large grilled window in its south wall those\nentering and leaving the Haram at Bab al-‘Atm might invoke a\nblessing on the tomb, according to Muslim custom. A recess in\nthe east wall extending into the vault (plate 21.6), together with\nthe relative thinness of the wall at that spot, indicates that there\ncould originally also have been a window on the street, as is the\ncase at the Awhadiyya Turba (above, p. 168).\n\nMEZZANINE (fig. 21.4)\nThe mezzanine is entered directly off the main staircase; there\nis no landing.\n\nThe complex arrangement of rooms and passages is best\nunderstood by consulting the plan (fig. 21.4) and section (fig.\n21.7). The upper extension of the central courtyard functioned\nat this level as a lightwell into which open four splayed\nwindows, one in each side. The corners are built up on\nsegmental squinches (the south-east squinch is shown in plate\n21.4) giving it an octagonal shape in plan. The south-west\ncorner of the octagon accommodates the entrance to a narrow\ncorridor over the staircase. It extends northwards as far as a\nblocked door. The area to the north beyond this blocked door\nis inaccessible, as is the area to the west since a door in the west\nwall of the corridor is also blocked.\n\nThere is a wider passage parallel with the east wall of the\nlightwell, which extends northwards and gives access to a short\ncorridor and a pair of tiny, low cells marked ‘E’ and ‘F north of\nthe lightwell and, beyond these, to two rooms (G and H) with\nan interconnecting passage. This area to the north of the\nlightwell shows signs of having been remodelled at some stage.\nAset of wooden steps in the north-western room leads up to the\nbackyard of later dwellings built over the mezzanine.\n\nThe mezzanine level was originally well provided with\ndaylight illumination and ventilation in spite of the labyrinthine\nmaze of rooms and interconnecting passages. The later vaulting\nover the street and the covering of the lightwell has almost\ncompletely shut out the light, however, and now the whole\nfloor is shrouded in sepulchral gloom. In these conditions it is\ntempting to believe that the narrow cross-vaulted chamber at\nthe centre of the south wall, marked ‘B’ on the plan (fig. 21.4),\nwas a sealed burial chamber, as the present tenant of the\n building suggests. Strangely, the only access into the chamber\nis a breach in the upper part of its north wall, which has the\nappearance of having been made relatively recently. Half full of\n\nearth and debris, there is, however, no obvious sign of a burial\nin it\n To the east and west of this ‘burial chamber’ there are\nlarger cross-vaulted rooms in the south-east (C).and south-west\n(A) corners of the mezzanine, each with a recess cut into its\nsouth wall, which is the north wall of the Haram. The horseshoe\narch of the doorway (plate 21.7) into the south-western room\n(A) is particularly interesting. It is largely re-used, as the vertical\njoint in the masonry to the left indicates. But the asymmetrical\n profile and the variation in the stone dressing shows that only\nthe left-hand spandrel and voussoirs, the keystone, and\npossibly one of the right-hand voussoirs are in secondary use.\nThe remainder appears to have been newly cut — following a\nslightly different curve — to fit the re-used arch into the\nadjoining structure. This is the only horseshoe arch within the\ncomplex.\n\nThere is an unexpectedly spacious cross-vaulted room (D)\nimmediately to the east of the south-east corner room. This\nroom is supported on a vault spanning the street below: an\ningenious way of extending the otherwise restricted\naccommodation at this level. It has two windows, one in the\nnorth wall overlooking the street (p/ate 21.8) and one in the\nsouth wall looking onto the Haram from under the portico at\nBab al-‘Atm. This latter window has been made by removing\nseveral stones from the upper structure of the gate itself, as may\nbe seen in plate 21.9 and fig. 21.10.\n UPPER FLOOR (fig. 21.5)\n\nThe main staircase originally continued straight to an open\ncourtyard on the roof of the mezzanine, of which the northern\npart has not been surveyed. Later constructions at the southern\nend abutting the upper part of the Haram wall blocked the final\nten steps and necessitated their realignment eastwards to reach\nthe entrance to the upper rooms of the Aminiyya at what is now\nthe south-east corner of the courtyard.\n\nThe group of later constructions against the Haram wall\nincludes in the centre a vestibule built in front of the original\nentrance to the upper floor of the Aminiyya. This entrance was\nhewn out of the Haram wall with sufficient expertise to form a\nsimple portal with a cloister vault (see fig. 21.5), now coated\nwith plaster. Stone benches flank the doorway, which leads\n directly into a small vestibule. A door in the south wall of the\nvestibule opens into the westernmost of the three rooms over\nthe portico. The original folded cross vault of this western\nroom survives: the first to be built in Jerusalem after the\nTankiziyya (see above, p. 231). The window in the south wall\nhas been converted into a door which now serves as the main\nentrance to the upper floor (see above, p. 252).\n\nThe small, original, vestibule appears once to have given\naccess also to the principal upper floor room to the east, but\nthat access has been blocked and replaced by a more recent\ndoor in the east wall of the western room. The principal room\nis square in plan and commands a magnificent view of the\nHaram through its triple window. There is a small window high\nup in the north wall of this room (plate 21.9) evidently above\n the height of the Haram wall. It appears not to be original; it was\nintroduced as part of an apparently later development to the\nnorth, above the room spanning the street just outside Bab al-\n‘Aum (see fig. 8.4). The domical vault of the principal room also\nappears not to be original; the unusually large mugarnas\nplaster decoration of the pendentives is Ottoman in style. This\n must be the dome mentioned below (p. 257 n. 25) that was\nrepaired inside and out in 963/1556. Similarly the domical vault\nin the eastern room, decorated with a muqarnas frieze in\nplaster, appears also to be the result of a later rebuilding,\nLoe following the earthquake of 952/1546 (see above,\np. 41).\n ON Oe\n\n1 Although the eastern extremity of the rock scarp is not visible in the Aminiyya,\nthe line of the rock surface can be traced in the rear wall of the portico under the\nAlmalikiyya and the Farisiyya where, significantly, there are no rooms at ground\nfloor level. By extrapolation we can establish that the rock surface, if it continued\nin a reasonably straight line, would originally have been a metre or two above the\nground floor level of the Aminiyya.\n\n2.

The distinctively dressed masonry of the north wall\nof the hall, bearing several masons’ marks, shows it to be\nCrusader. This hall must be the monastic quarters of the\nTemplar Order built probably in the 1160s” and described by\nTheodorich in 1170.” The eastern part of it was converted into\nthe Women’s Mosque, evidently shortly after Saladin’s\nconquest of the city. The western part became an assembly hall\nfor the Fakhriyya.\n\nA more or less regular series of openings pierce both the\nnorth and south walls of the hall; all those in the south wall\nremain open but of those in the north wall (fig. 22.2) only three\nare still open: one at the east end, one in the centre (which\nserves as an entrance to the Women’s Mosque) and one\ntowards the west end, which was blocked by the mibrab (plate\n22.1) of the former Maghribi Mosque, but re-opened to link the\n two parts of the Islamic Museum. At the west end the structure\nchanges somewhat. The south-western bay had a pointed ar ch\nin its south wall clearly visible in the exterior masonry of the\nHaram wall. It is hard to imagine what the purpose of this arch\nmight have been for it is blocked by masonry similar to that of\nthe rest of the south and west walls and contains a grilled\nwindow virtually identical to others that are obviously original.\nSince the arch and the masonry blocking it appear to be\ncontemporaneous, one can only guess that it was intended\nsomehow to facilitate construction of this corner of the\n building, though quite how it could have done so is a mystery.\nOpposite that arch, at the west end of the north wall of the hall,\nthere is a similar arch which was originally open. It is now\nblocked by the gib/a wall of the Fakhriyya.\n\n(ii) Vaulting springers\n\nIn the north face of the north wall of the Templar Hall (fig. 22.2)\nare a series of springers apparently intended as the southern\nabutments of a series of vaults. The springers are well\nintegrated into the masonry of the wall and appear almost as if\nthey were built along with it. There are, however, indications\nthat they are in fact later insertions. For instance, while the\nspringers are spaced exactly half as far apart as the springings of\nthe Templar Hall vaults, they are not symmetrical with them as\nwould be expected if they were built simultaneously. As a result\nseveral springers impinge awkwardly on the lintels over\nopenings in the north wall of the Hall (see figs. 22.3 and 22.7).\nIt would appear, therefore, that the springers were inserted\nafter the Hall was built, perhaps to support the vaults of a\nportico or cloister. No other trace of such a cloister exists and\nit is likely that the work was interrupted, possibly by Saladin’s\ncapture of Jerusalem, never to be completed.\n\n(iti) Ayyitbid halls\n\nExtending northwards from the two westernmost bays of the\nTemplar Hall were two long halls roofed by barrel vaults with\n various excisions to clear openings in the supporting walls.\nOnly the eastern hall survives; the Fakhriyya was constructed\non the site of the western one. The articulation of the south-east\ncorner (marked ‘A’ on the plan, fig. 22.3) of the eastern hall so\nas to avoid blocking one of the windows of the Templar Hall on\nwhich it abuts shows that these walls were built some time after\nthe Templar Hall. The re-use of one of the springers (marked\n‘B’ on the plan) discussed in section (#) for the vaulting at the\nsouth end of the eastern hall confirms that the construction of\nthis hall was subsequent also to the springers. Since the\nmasonry of these later halls bears no coherent evidence of\nCrusader tooling or masons’ marks, they are likely to be post-\nCrusader, probably Ayyiibid.”4\n\nThe eastern hall initially opened to the east in a series of\narches of which the southern three and a springing of a fourth\nas well as the northernmost one are still discernible (see fig.\n12.2, fold-out at back). They have been filled in to leave in the\ncentre of each a rectangular window surmounted by a slit. This\nmay have been done when the eastern hall was consecrated as\na mosque for North Africans, known as the Jami‘ al-Maghariba,”’\nprobably in about 590/1194 when Saladin’s son, al-Malik al-\nAfdal, endowed the neighbouring town quarter in favour of the\nMaghribi community in Jerusalem.”° About the middle of the\neastern wall a new entrance facade (see fig. 12.2, fold-out) was\n erected in 1288/1871, partially obscuring the arched frontage of\nthe original hall.’’ At the same time the vaulting was altered to\nprovide a domed bay immediately inside the new entrance.”\nThis eastern hall, together with the western part of the Templar\nHall, was converted into the Islamic Museum in 1927.”\n\nOf the western hall little remains except for traces of\nvaulting in the spine wall between the two halls (see below).\n\nThese Ayyubid halls extended north to within 6.5m of the\nBab al-Maghariba. Their north facade survives (fig. 22.4, plate\n22.2). It consists of two pointed-arched doorways placed more\nor less symmetrically on either side of the central axis. The\ndoorways are built largely of re-used Crusader elements\nincluding hoodmoulds and (on the left-hand doorway) elbow\nbrackets supporting a lintel (plate 22.3). Both doorways have\n undergone subsequent alterations. The tympanum of the left\none is blocked save for three small windows; the tympanum of\nthe right one is still open but its right-hand jamb is masked by\na pier of the western portico of the Haram (erected some time\nbetween 745/1345 and 887/1482), and a pointed arch (also\ncomposed of re-used Crusader elements) containing a smaller\ndoor has been built into the original doorway. A mibrab,\nprobably late Mamluk or early Ottoman to judge by the small\n\ncircular inscription above it2° has been placed centrally\nbetween the two doorways.\n The left doorway opened into the Jami’ al-Maghariba, the\nright one into the Fakhriyya. This is how al-‘Umari described it:\n\n(The south wall of the Haram) begins on the west side with\na raised platform... in front is a mibrab [no longer extant],\nnext to it on its eastern side is the door of the Fakhriyya\nZawiya ... which is followed by a raised platform next to\nwhich is the door of Jami‘ al-Maghariba ... the length of the\nporch [in front of this facade] is 11% dhira‘ (approx.\n8.16m)..\n\nThe porch mentioned by al-‘Umari survived until the 1920s\nwhen it was demolished. It is clearly visible in early\nphotographs (plate 22.4).\n\n IE PAK LA\n\n1) Site\n\nThe right-hand (western) doorway in the north wall of the\n\\yyuibid halls led, as al-‘Umari states, into the Fakhriyya. Access\no the area immediately beyond that door is restricted\n10wadays; we have only van Berchem’s description (above, p.\n258) as a guide to the northern part of it. The southern part is\nentered by a door from the Templar Hall, now part of the\nslamic Museum, to the south. That door (marked ‘C’ on the\nlan, fig. 22.3) leads into the columned hall (van Berchem’s\noratory’), described below, which opened to the north\nhrough two archways. These archways have been blocked up\no leave two round-headed windows in the west one anda door\nsurmounted by a window in the east one. Now only the door\n‘emains open (see plate 22.5). To the north, beyond the\n columned hall, is an open yard enclosed by a low wall (the\nupper part of the Haram wall) on its west side, by a relatively\nmodern partition wall to the north (plate 22.8), and to the east\nby the spine wall that originally divided the two Ayyabid halls.\n There are several openings in this spine wall, all blocked up*\nsave for one, reached by an open flight of eight steps, that gives\naccess to the roof by way of a staircase in the thickness of the\nwall (see fig. 22.3). Traces of springers and voussoirs\nprotruding from the spine wall (plate 22.5) indicate that this\narea was once vaulted. The uniform north facade of the two\nhalls (described above) suggests that the vaulting of this\nwestern hall was contemporaneous with and extended\nalongside the eastern Ayybid hall. The lateral thrust of the\nvault must have contributed to its collapse, perhaps during an\nearthquake. Subsequent rebuilding on the site can be traced in\nthe masonry of the Haram wall.\n (ti) Haram Wall (plate 22.6; fig. 22.5)\n\nThe stretch of Haram wall from the south-west corner to the\nBab al-Maghariba is in its present form the result of untold\nbuilding operations over the years, as the intricate mosaic of\ndifferent masonries testifies. By isolating individual\ncomponents of this mural mosaic, rather in the way an\narchaeologist might analyse the stratigraphy of an excavated\ntrench, we can establish the relative phases of construction and\nso comprehend better the state of the site when the Fakhriyya\nwas founded.\n\nOur ‘stratigraphical’ analysis deals with the area of wall\nextending from the south-west corner of the Haram to the\nnorthern limit of the columned hall. Beyond this point,\nattached to the Haram wall to the north, there formerly existed\na group of buildings (see plate 22.7), some of which may have\nbelonged to the Fakhriyya according to the Ottoman Tahrir\nregisters (cited above, p. 260). These buildings were\ndemolished unrecorded in 1968-69 and the wall partly rebuilt.\n\nFig. 22.8 illustrates the various phases of building. The\nprecise dating of the pre-Mamlik ‘strata’ need not detain us\nhere, but it is worth noting that there is only a trace of an\nUmayyad phase (masonry type 2). Round the corner, however,\nat the south wall, the masonry which we consider to be\nUmayyad (see p. 45) is plentiful, built directly on top of the\n distinctive Herodian masonry, type 1. Immediately above the\nUmayyad masonry at the south wall comes masonry of type 3\nwhich extends round to the west wall, and which may belong to\nthe ‘Abbasid period. Masonry type 4, under the unmistakable\nCrusader masonry type 5, may be Fatimid. The regularly bossed\nmasonry type 5 of the Templar Hall originally continued north\nas far as the dotted line x-x!. North of that line, under the\ncolumned hall, there is another masonry, type 6, incorporating\nhere and there bossed stones similar to those of the Crusader\ntype 5. These bossed stones seem to be in secondary use and\nthis part of the wall may be remains of the substructure of the\nwestern Ayyubid hall. Whatever the actual date of masonry type\n6 may be, it is sure that it precedes the masonry type 7 above it,\nwhich belongs to the columned hall and is, so far as we can tell,\nMamluk. Finally there are repairs made in masonry type 8,\nwhich not only separates type 4 from type 6 but, as the\ncontinuity of the coursing shows, extends over the top of type\n7. This makes it the latest of all, almost certainly Ottoman. Two\nrows of putlog holes are discernible in this masonry.\n\nCertain conclusions can be drawn from this analysis of\nmasonry types. The north-west corner of the Templar Hall\ncollapsed evidently before the western Ayyabid hall was\nconstructed since the masonry of type 6 extends southwards\nbeyond the line x-x\'. The Ayyabid hall itself subsequently\ncollapsed, perhaps in the earthquake of 702/1303. Masonry type\n7 seems to belong to the Fakhriyya, built after that collapse but\n some time before 732/1332 (the date of the death of the\nfounder) on the remains of the western Ayyabid hall. Later still,\nprobably in the Ottoman period, repairs to the north-west\ncorner of the Templar Hall made in masonry type 8 included\nthe replacement of the vaulting of the columned hall (see\nbelow).\n\n(iii) Columned hall (plates 22.9 and 22.10)\n\nThe relative narrowness of the site limited the width of the\ncolumned hall. It is approximately 8.10m wide and 8.30m long.\nThis area could have been spanned in the usual way by a cross\nvault; indeed, it may originally have been roofed in this way.\nNow a row of three columns supporting transverse arches and\nsix small vaults divides the hall from north to south into two\naisles of three bays each. Iron tie-bars above the column\ncapitals help to brace the structure. The vaults of the east aisle\nare elliptical and those of the west one are domical. Both types\nare typically Ottoman in Jerusalem, as are their carved stone\ncrescent finials (one of which is visible in plate 22.8). The\nmasonry analysis of the west wall also suggests that the upper\npart of the structure is Ottoman. They may be part of the repairs\nmade in 963/1556 (above, p. 260). Three windows in masonry\ntype 7, thought to be Mamluk, open in the west wall in positions\ncorresponding to the centres of the vaulting bays, suggesting\nthat the Ottoman builders arranged their columns and vaults to\n accommodate existing openings. A doorway (now blocked) in\nthe east wall opened into the former Jami‘ al-Maghariba and it\ntoo is accommodated by the vaulting system. The two archways\nin the north wall are aligned with the aisles, and they must\nbelong to the Ottoman reconstruction. :\nA mibrab (fig. 22.9, plate 22.11) beautifully constructed in\nmarble ablaq and flanked by two re-used Crusader columns\ncomplete with capitals and bases, is placed not quite in the\ncentre of the south wall. A marble border frames its pointed\narch and forms a loop over the keystone. Within the loop a\nroundel is inscribed with the phrase Ui’l/db, ‘for Allah’. This\nmarble border has an unfinished appearance on the left side.\nThe wall containing the mibrab blocks the archway that\n originally opened into the Templar Hall (see above, p 261).\nThe right-hand springing of that archway is still visible (see fig.\n22.7), as is its crown above the roof of the columned hall. The\nmibrab has been set as far to the right as possible within the\nconfines of that earlier archway in an apparent effort to have it\nas close as possible to the central axis of the hall. The present\nrow of columns is arranged so that the east aisle is wider than\nthe west one, obviously in order to avoid masking the mibrab.\nIn this the builders did not entirely succeed for in places the\nsouth-east transverse arch overlaps the looped marble border\nround the mibradb arch (plate 22.11). At its other end it\noverlapped the left-hand edge of a re-used Koranic inscription\nin sixth/twelfth-century foliated R7#/7 script in marble that was\nbuilt into the south wall? Thus it is clear that the mihrab\npreceded the Ottoman vaulting; it is typically eighth/fourteenth\ncentury Mamluk in style and must surely belong to the\nFakhriyya.\n\nAt the east end of the south wall the narrow pointed-\narched doorway (plate 22.12) marked ‘C’ on the plan (fig. 22.3)\nleads down to that western part of the Templar Hall that al-\n‘Umari’s text*! appears to include as a sort of extension of\n * We should like to thank Mr Mark Potter (who, with the assistance of Mr Graeme\nPert, was largely responsible for our survey of the site) for helpful discussion of\nthe analysis of this building.\n\n1 CIA (Haram), 129-30.\n\n2 Al-“Umari, Masdlik, 152.\n\n3 Mujir, ii, 34.\n\n4 Sultik, ii, 142, 166 and 250.\n\n5 For his biography in general, see WG/i, iv, 335; Durar, iv, 255-6; Khitdt, ii, 311;\nIbn Battiita, i, 87 (Gibb, Travels, i, 55).\n\n6 Beitréige, 151.\n\n7 Beitrége, 157-161; Sulitk, ii, 115-123.\n\n8 Sulitk, ii, 347-8, but see Durar, iv, 256.

Mujir al-Din states that the adjoining\nHaram minaret (see below, pp. 270-272) is built upon the\nassembly hall (majma‘) of the Fakhriyya.°’ The doorway is\nflanked by corner columns, obviously in re-use for one has a\nbase for a capital and the other, though it has a Crusader thick-\nleaf capital, has a bulbous base in typical Mamluk style.\n\nTo the right of the mibrab a cupboard (see plate 22.9) has\nbeen opened in the masonry, perhaps intended to hold Korans.\nEvidence of the collapse of the north-west corner of the\nTemplar Hall may be seen in repairs to the wall on the right-\nhand side above the cupboard.\n\nThe floor of the hall is laid with a polychrome marble\npavement set out in a pattern (fig. 22.10) which seems to take\nlittle account of the architecture. The central strip of paving\ndoes not align with the mibrab and in several places rough\nlimestone pavers are used instead of marble. The pattern\nsuggests that the present pavement is not the original one. It is\nquite probable that the marble itself belongs to an original\nMamluk pavement, but it was lifted and relaid at some time,\npossibly when the columns were introduced to support the\nnew vaulting.\n (unpublished paper read at Cardiff in August-September 1983), 5.\n23 Theodorich, Description, xvii, 31, cited by Rovik, op. cit.\n24 The eastern hall lies partly over the staircase leading up from the Herodian\ngate known since the nineteenth century as Barclay’s Gate.

This doorway leads to a further flight of steps within the\nthickness of the spine wall. At the head of the steps is a stone\nchamber of recent construction. A door in the west wall of this\nchamber gives access to the roof of the columned hall of the\nFakhriyya; and a door in the east wall opens on the roof of the\neastern Ayyubid hall. The minaret will have been reached from\nthis staircase by crossing the roof of the Ayyubid hall.\n\nSHAFT (elevations: figs. 22.6 and 23.2; plate 23.2)\n\nThe decoration of the shaft is concentrated on the north face\nwhere an entrance door gives on a spiral staircase rising within\nthe shaft to the muezzin’s gallery.\n The entrance door is set in a very shallow recess framed by\na quirked ogee moulding. On either side of the door are two\ncarved stone bosses (see plate 23.3); and over the lintel is a\nrelieving arch of voussoirs with rebated joints. A raised stone\ndisk or patera three courses above the relieving arch is carved\nin low relief with a five-pointed star.\n\nThe lower storey is divided from the second storey by a\nquirked ogee moulding. One course above that moulding are\na further two paterae decorated with six- and eight-pointed\nstars. In the middle of this storey a shallow recess with a sloping\nsill and a mugarnas head (plate 23.4) contains paired slit\nwindows separated by a dumpy column. The windows have\nlittle fluted conchs carved in their common lintel.\n\nA billet moulding marks the transition from the second to\nthe third storey. Three courses above this moulding a change in\nthe colour and texture of the stone indicates that the upper part\nof the minaret is a later reconstruction. An inscription under\nthe canopy of the muezzin’s gallery gives the date: 1342/1923-\n24. Contemporary photographs’ show that the top of the\nminaret was dismantled and completely rebuilt at that time.\nThe earlier muezzin’s gallery was carried on roll corbels.\n DATE\n\nWhile the date of reconstruction of the top of the minaret is\nknown, the date of construction or reconstruction of the shaft\nis not. It appears to belong to a single phase of construction,\nthere being no trace of any earlier masonry. The style of\ndecoration — notably the feeble profile of the moulding around\nthe entrance door, the paterae above the door, and the finicky\ndaintiness of the mugarnas head of the window recess — is\n ANUTLS\n\n1 Elsewhere in Mujir al-Din’s text it is clear that by sabib of the Fakhriyya he\nmeans its founder (Mujir, 404, 426).\n2 Mujir, 379.\n\n3 Al-“Umari, Masdlik, 152.\n4 Al-Suytti, writing shortly after 875/1470, calls the Bab al-Silsila Minaret (no. 20)\nthe ‘southern’ one, implying that none existed to the south of it, but it is difficult\n\nto believe that if the Fakhriyya Minaret was built after that date Mujir al-Din would\nnot have known its history,\n\n5 Bayan al-majlis al-shari al-islami al-a\'la bi-Filastin, Jerusalem, 1341-42/1923-\n24, unnumbered plate.\n\n6 St. H.

Qalawin rebuilt it (addada\nimaratabu) in the year 737 (1336-37).\n Thus Mujir considered the gate to have been built on the site of\nan earlier gate, but this conclusion may have been based on a\nmisinterpretation of the inscription. What the inscription\n actually says is juddida hadha t bab... the Means ON [Aan\nin this context is ambiguous; either ‘was renewed’ or ‘was built\nanew’ would fit2° Van Berchem, following Mujir al-Din, opted\nfor the former, while Grabar favours the latter. The\narchaeological evidence, in so far as the pre-Mamlik market\nopened off the street and stopped about forty metres short of\nthe Haram wall, tends to suggest that there was no pre-Mamlik\ngate. The substantial difference in level between the market-\nstreet and the Haram, accommodated by two flights of steps\nevidently built as part of the Mamlak development, also\nsuggests that no earlier gate existed. At least, there is no visible\nevidence of any earlier adjustment of the levels nor of any\nearlier gate. The pre-Crusader descriptions of the Haram, as is\nwell known,” include lists of gates, but none that can be\nsatisfactorily associated with the site of the present Bab al-\nQattinin. Indeed, had an earlier gate existed there, it would be\ndifficult to explain the close proximity of the Bab al-Mathara\nwhich is only thirteen metres to the south. That gate was\napparently open in the Ayyabid period to give access to the\nsigaya Of al-Malik al-‘Adil (589/1193). In short, the indications\nare that Bab al-Qattanin is an original Mamlik construction,\n‘recently constructed and newly opened’ in al-‘Umari’s words,\nto link the new market-street with the Haram.\n\nThis new gate was built into the west portico of the Haram.\nThe lateral walls of the portal open directly under the portico\n(plate 24.6), and above these openings is some stalactite\nvaulting of the highest quality.** As fig. 12.2 (see fold-out at\nback) shows, the two bays of the portico which flank the gate\nare larger than the others, rising to buttress the substantial bulk\nof the gate itself. The structural harmony of this composition\nimplies a homogeneity of construction: the gate was\ndeliberately incorporated as part of the central portico which\nconnects the two earlier portions of the west portico to the\nnorth and to the south. Mujir al-Din confirms that this portico\nwas built at the same time as the gate:\n\nThe porticoes at the west border of the Haram were\nrebuilt during the reign of al-Malik al-Nasir Muhammad...\nThe portico which extends from the minaret at Bab al-\nSilsila to near Bab al-Nazir was built or rebuilt (mira) in\nthe year 737.”\n\nThe gateway is set in a trefoil-headed recess contained within a\nmuch larger recess spanned by a vast semidome supported on\nfive tiers of stalactite corbelling (plate 24.9). The ablaq\nvoussoirs of the trefoil arch“ over the gateway are alternately\ncream-coloured limestone and black bituminous limestone.\n The voussoirs of the pointed arch which frames the slightly\nsmaller frontal arch of the semidome are of red and cream-\ncoloured ablaq, the usual combination in Jerusalem. The\ncornice moulding which crowns the composition steps up on\neither side of the semidome before curving over the crown of\nthe arch. The profile of this moulding is not typically Mamlak,\nseeming to belong rather to an earlier period. The section\nwhich bends up over the crown of the arch was obviously made\nspecially for the gate and so must date from 737/1336-37 or\nthereabouts. But the fact that this section is less eroded than the\nadjoining straight sections suggests that these straight sections\nmight have been re-used. There are analogous cyma mouldings\nbelow the parapets of both the Golden Gate (Umayyad?) and\nthe south wall of the Aqsa Mosque. R.W. Hamilton has proposed\na Fatimid (fifth/eleventh century) date for the Aqs4 moulding,”\nalthough an earlier dating should not be ruled out. A similar\nmoulding is to be found below the parapet of the south wall of\nthe Umayyad Great Mosque at Damascus, which was built by al-\nWalid between 88/707 and 96/714-15.% A more detailed\ncomparison of these mouldings is needed before any firm\nconclusion can be reached.\n\nThe architecture of the gate has been likened to the\nentrance portal at the Tankiziyya,® but there is no strong\nresemblance between the two. Distinctive features of the Bab\nal-Qattanin (plate 24.10) not to be found in the Tankiziyya\nportal (plate 18.8) are: the stepped plan, the ablaq trefoil-\nheaded gate recess, the five-tiered muqarnas system, the\nundecorated semidome, the ablaq voussoirs of the recess arch,\nand the cyma cornice moulding bent around the arch.\nConsequently van Berchem’s suggestion that the two\nmonuments are perhaps the work of the same architect is not\nreally supported by the architectural evidence.\n\nVan Berchem is correct, however, in observing that Bab al-\nQattanin faces to the Haram and announces the market-street\nto the west rather than the Haram to the east. But there are\nindications that the western approach to the gate was decorated\nas well. The abutments of the present cross vault which spans\nthe western flight of steps leading up to the gate are obviously\nlater additions; hence the vault itself must also be a later\naddition. The bay spanned by the original vault — before the\npresent vaulting abutments were introduced — is almost exactly\nsquare in plan, which suggests that the original vault may have\nbeen domical. Re-used muqarnas fragments (plate 24.11) built\ninto the walls of the room directly above the present vault (fig.\n24.18), match in size and general style the fourth tier of\nmugarnas corbelling supporting the semidome of Bab al-\n Qattanin. These mugarnas fragments are thus of such a size\nand shape as would be suitable for the transition zone of a\ndome over the western approach to the gate. An exemplary\nmodel of a dome on a muqarnas transition zone is to be found\njust a stone’s throw away at the inner porch of Bab al-Nazir\n(plate 35.3) built in 707/1307-08 for al-Nasir Muhammad.\n\nWhatever the original vaulting of this bay on the town side\nof Bab al-Qattanin was — and the indications outlined above\nshow that it was probably a dome — it collapsed or was\ndemolished some time before the present cross vault was\nerected. The room above must have been built shortly after\nthe erection of that cross vault. Apparently at the same time a\nlittle pointed-arched window, visible in the early photographs\nof the gate, “° was opened in the tympanum of the trefoil arch.\nThis window was blocked and the arch refurbished during the\n1927 repairs.*”\n\nWESTERN ENTRANCE (plate 24.3)\n\nThe lower part of the western entrance to Siiq al-Qattanin\nappears to belong to the pre-Mamlik (Crusader) phase of\nconstruction since the distinctive bossed masonry survives\napparently i situ to a height of almost four metres. The\nMamluk masonry above is smooth-faced.\n\nA tall pointed-arch recess encloses the entrance proper,\nwhich is spanned by a flat arch composed of seven interlocking\nvoussoirs surmounted by a relieving arch and a circular oculus.\nThe flat arch rests on simply profiled shoulders in a similar\nfashion to the lintel at the entrance to the khan, which bears\nTankiz’s foundation inscription.\n\nFlanking the recess are two springings for vaults (plate\n24.3) which either spanned or were intended to span across\nTariq al-Wad on each side of the entrance. These vault\nspringings are integral parts of the springers of the recess arch\nand must be contemporaneous with it. The vaults themselves\nmay never have been built; no trace of them exists and there is\nno indication of corresponding abutments on the opposite side\nof the street.\n\nThe moulding which extends across the central part of the\nwest facade just below the parapet above the entrance is again\nnot typically Mamluk, being similar to the one over the eastern\nentrance, Bab al-Qattanin (above, p. 278).\n\nThe western entrance, in contrast to the eastern entrance,\nhas no doors. Nor could doors ever have been fitted for there\nis no provision for hinge sockets and, in any case, the booths\nnearest to this entrance would be blocked by opened door\nleaves. Likewise the passage leading north from the middle of\n the market street to Tariq Bab al-Hadid was evidently open at\nall times. The individual booths in the market-street could be\nlocked up of course. The gates of Bab al-Qattanin were\ntherefore to prevent access to the Haram from the market-\nstreet and not vice versa. This arrangement is in accordance\nwith current practice whereby all the Haram gates are closed at\nnight, with only a guard patrol remaining within the precinct.\n\nMARKET-STREET (plan, fig. 24.2; section, fig. 24.18)\n\nThe market-street extends 95m from east to west. On either\nside open ranges of shops. The arched openings of the shops in\nthe western part of the market-street are different from those in\nthe eastern part (see fig. 24.18), one of the indications that the\ntwo were separate constructions (see above, p. 273). The barrel\nvault roofing the market-street appears, however, to be a\ncontinuous and homogeneous structure.** Transverse arches\nspanning across the market-street divide the vaulting into\nindividual bays (numbered 1-30 on the plan). Alternate\ntransverse arches are constructed differently: one type is\ncomposed of well-cut voussoirs, the others are mere\nsimulations built up in plaster, as may be seen between bays 19\nand 20 where the plaster has been removed. Each alternate bay\ncontains a rooflight; those at bays 20, 22 and 24 are now blocked\nby later structures on the roof. In three places a pair of adjacent\nbays is spanned by a single vault: at bays 8-9 a folded cross vault\nrises to an octagonal oculus; at bays 17-18 a cross vault rises to\na mugqarnas cupola at the crown, which is inscribed twice on\nthe bottom tier of mugarnas with the signature of the craftsman\nMuhammad b. Ahmad (see plate 24.12); and at bays 29-30 is the\nlater cross vault. Each of these double bays marks a special\nfeature. The one at bays 8-9 corresponds to the entrance to the\nkhan (thus implying that the khan was built more or less\ncontemporaneously with the market-street); that at bays 17-18\nby the entrance to Hammam al-Shifa’ distinguishes the west\nend of the eastward extension of the market-street towards the\nHaram; and the cross vault at bays 29-30 replaces what appears\nto have been a dome next to the Haram gate (see above).\n\nThe street pavement was re-levelled during the recent\nrestoration. Originally it sloped gently down from the foot of\nthe steps at bay 28 to emerge at the west end on the same level\nas the street, Tariq al-Wad (see plate 24.3), where four new\nsteps have been built to compensate for the re-levelling. Stone\nbenches on either side of the market-street, which still survive\nin the eastern part (see plate 24.7), originally continued for the\nfull length of the street. These benches provided space where\nmerchants could display their wares and conduct their\nbusiness. The continuity of the benches was interrupted on\nthe north side at bay 16 where a flight of steps rises north to the\nlane leading to Tariq Bab al-Hadid, and on the south side at bay\n21 where the rear wall of a shop has been breached at some\ntime to give access to the Ablutions Place (formerly the sigdya\nofal-‘Adil). Presumably there will also have been a break on the\nsouth side at bays 8-9, the entrance to the khan.\n OFFER FLOOK LOUGINGS (plan, J1§. 44.9)\nOn either side of the market-street are a series of small upper\nfloor rooms that provide lodgings (rubiz’). Two on the south\nside (at bays 11 and 15) have what appears to be a blocked\ntrapdoor in the middle of the floor, suggesting that they were\nused as storerooms for the shops below. Each room is lit by a\nsmall window opening on the market-street (see plate 24.13\nand fig. 24.18).\n\nOn the north side of the market-street the barrel-vaulted\nrooms of the rub‘ ran in a continuous series, one above each\nshop, with a more elaborate cross-vaulted chamber at the east\nend (bays 29-30). The two westernmost rooms have been\nreplaced by a later (Ottoman) hall. A corridor on the north side\nof the rooms, now blocked in several places (see plan, fig. 24.3),\ngave access to them (plate 24.14). This corridor appears to have\nbeen reached by a dog-leg staircase entered from the lane\nleading to Tariq Bab al-Hadid.\n\nOn the south side of the market-street the arrangement of\nrooms is similar except for interruptions at Hammam al-Shifa’\nand at the khan. At Hammam al-Shifa’ the entrance porch\n(higher than the adjoining shops, section, fig. 24.15) and a well-\nroom on the roof (see below, p. 286) intervene between the\nroom at bay 16 and the one at bay 21. At the khan, its tall\nentrance hall intervenes. The easternmost rooms (bays 27-30)\non this side have been incorporated into the later Ribat al-\nZamani (see below, p. 576). Access to the other rooms is from\nthe roofs of neighbouring buildings (plate 24.15). These roofs\nare reached by an open stair on the north side of Zuqaq Bab al-\nMathara and another on the east side of Tariq al-Wad over the\nboiler-room of Hammam al-‘Ayn (see below).\n\nKHAN TANKIZ (plan, fig. 24.6; section, fig. 24.12)\nAt bays 8-9 of the market-street a broad archway (now partly\nblocked by a modern wall) opens to the hall leading south to\nthe entrance to the khan. The shops on either side of this\nentrance hall are virtually identical in design and construction\nto those in the western part of the market-street.\n\nThe tall barrel vault of the entrance hall is divided into\nthree bays by transverse arches. Excisions in either side\nprovide clearance for high-level windows admitting light to the\nlodgings on the upper floor. At the crown of the central vaulting\nbay is a square rooflight like those in the market-street. On the\nroof a masonry cowl (see plate 24.16), open to the south,\n\nPERE ee en’ eos\n\n shelters this rooflight. It may be presumed that similar cowls\nonce sheltered the rooflights in the market-street, which are\nnow fitted with modern glass covers.\n\nAt the south end of the entrance hall is a doorway, 2.76m\nwide, that leads to the khan. It was originally fitted with double\ndoors opening south, but these have long since disappeared.\nThe doorway is spanned by a monolithic lintel which is\nsupported at each end on corbels and surmounted by a\nrelieving arch composed of three massive stones (see fig.\n24.18). The damaged foundation inscription (cited above, p.\n277) is carved on the keystone of the relieving arch, on the\nlintel, and on the corbels. Tankiz’s blazon — a cup on an\nundivided circular shield — decorates the middle of the lintel\nand is repeated on either side of the corbels. Above the\ndoorway a segmental-arched window admits light to the\nentrance hall.\n\nThe entrance doorway opens into a large courtyard. A\nsubstantial wall now divides the courtyard from north to south\n(plate 24.16). Since this wall abuts on the north wall of the\ncourtyard without keying into it, it would appear to be a later\ninsertion.\n\nVarious doors, some altered from their original form,\nopen in the east, north and west sides of the courtyard. At the\neast and west ends of the north side they open into large barrel-\nvaulted chambers now used as stables. Square openings (now\nblocked) at the crowns of the vaults provided light and\nventilation. The east wall of the western chamber has been\ndismantled at some time to connect this chamber with the two\nwestern shops in the entrance hall (see plate 24.17). That later\nopening to the northern of these shops has subsequently been\nblocked by a concrete partition.\n\nThe structures on the south side are now buried under an\nenormous pile of debris retained by a modern wall across this\nend of the courtyard. Nothing is known of the former structures\nthere. Fig. 24.7 gives an impression of what the original layout\nmight have been. In the west side of the courtyard only one\ndoor remains. It opens into a plain barrel-vaulted chamber. In\nthe east side an archway (now partly blocked) and two\ndoorways (see section, fig. 24.12) lead into barrel-vaulted\nrooms. The southern of these rooms has a splayed embrasure\nto a window giving on the court of the Ablutions Place to the\n\neast.\nAE fie Wet Sen A Cele eee ee I A ee ee eee\n remains of the springing of an arch (see plate 24.18) which\nmight once have supported a_ staircase to additional\naccommodation on an upper floor, but of such no trace exists.\n\nBATH-HOUSES\n\nA familiar feature of Islamic towns is the public bath-house,\nusually located close to the markets and congregational\nmosque, where bathing for ritual or social purposes could be\nenjoyed in pleasant surroundings.” The plans of these bath-\nhouses, derived from Roman baths, varied little. An entrance,\nusually quite plain, led into a spacious changing room. Latrines\nwere generally isolated from the changing room by a long\npassageway. From the changing room bathers progressed\nthrough cold and warm rooms to the hot room. The bathing\nrooms were roofed by domes perforated with little circular\nwindows through which shafts of light penetrated the steamy\n atmosphere. Next to the hot room, water was heated in a boiler\nroom which, along with its associated fuel store, had a separate\n‘service’ access. Both bath-houses connected with Siq al-\nQattanin have this sequence of rooms, but their disposition\nvaries in each.\n\n(@) Hammam al-Shifa’ (plan, fig. 24.5; section, fig. 24.15).\n\nIn the copy of Tankiz’s wagfiyya (see above, p. 225 n. 17) this\nbath is referred to as the Southern Bath; it is situated to the\nsouth of the market-street. The waqfiyya includes a brief\ndescription of the layout and fittings, which have altered little\nover the centuries.\n\nWhile the oblique alignment of the northern and eastern\nparts of the bath-house suggest that they are built on older\nfoundations, the normal orientation of the south-eastern part\nindicates that it is Mamltk.\n\nOn the south side of the market-street at bays 18-20 three\n courtyard fromthe south —\n\narchways, similar to those of the shops in the eastern half of the\nstreet, open on a vaulted entrance porch. Originally a wide\nopening (now blocked) in the south wall of the porch led\ndirectly into the changing room.\n\nThe changing room, called mashlah in the wadfiyya,\nconsists ofa large hall roofed by a folded cross vault rising to an\noctagonal oculus at the crown, now covered by a modern\ncylindrical rooflight that probably replaces an earlier lantern\n(see plate 24.19). The vault is criss-crossed with wires from\nwhich towels hang to dry (see plate 24.20).\n\nTowards the middle of the floor, not quite under the\noculus, stands an octagonal marble tank containing a fountain\nenclosed by a later iron cage in baroque style. The fountain is\nmade from a hollowed-out Byzantine basketwork capital (with\n of roofs from south-east\n\nChi-Rho monograms alternating with trefoils in a guilloche\nround the rim) resting on a short marble column. It no longer\nworks; some hydraulic system must once have maintained a\nsupply of water to the fountain through the column shaft into\nthe hollow capital from where it poured through holes in the\nside into the tank, which also has holes in its sides to let the\nwater spill into a gutter around the base. From the gutter water\n will presumably have run off into a drain, perhaps to a cistern.\n\nThe floor of the changing room is paved with slabs of fine\ngreyish marble, possibly the original pavement though the\nwagdfiyya states that it was of coloured marble. Arched recesses\nwith raised floors reached by three steps in the east, south and\nwest sides of the room are where bathers dress and undress\nand may relax with a refreshing drink. There is asmaller arched\nrecess in the back wall of the south recess, and two alcoves in\nthe back wall of the east recess. To the north of the east recess\na short barrel-vaulted passage leads to a door, now the sole\nentrance to the bathhouse. According to the wagfiyya there\nwere three iron [grilled] windows in this side of the room —\npresumably the present door and two alcoves — which opened\nona little garden (junayna) planted with orange trees and rose\nbushes. Sadly, this garden no longer exists.\n\nA doorway in the south-east corner of the changing room\nleads into a small lobby from which a long corridor (now\nblocked) led south to an oblong room with a pierced dome,\nnow partly collapsed (plate 24.21). This room must originally\nhave housed the latrines. The present latrine is located at the\nnorth end of the corridor, and the south end (beyond the\nmodern blocking wall) now serves as the entrance to the men’s\nlatrines in the Ablutions Place.”!\n\nAt the lobby, a door opposite the one from the changing\nroom opens south into the first bathing room. This is the cold\nroom where bathers might undress close to the warmer rooms\nin winter. A stone bench against the west wall returns some way\nagainst the north and south walls (see plan, fig. 24.5). The room\nis roofed by a shallow dome on pendentives; the dome (plate\n24.22) is pierced by numerous circular windows (several of\nwhich are now blocked) composed of pottery cylinders closed\nby glass disks, some coloured, on the exterior.\n\nNear the east end of the south wall of the cold room a door\nopens into the warm room. This room is divided by partitions\nthat appear to be later insertions. Benches against the walls\ncontain marble washbasins. A small high-level opening in the\nwest wall gives access to an irregular space (shown on the plan,\n\nJig. 24.5) with no obvious purpose. The room is roofed in three\nbays by perforated oval domes separated by transverse arches.\nThe glass disks closing the perforations in these domes\noccasionally have a protuberant spherical bulb, like the lid of a\nbon-bon jar, apparently intended to focus sunlight into\nspecially brilliant shafts.\n\nFrom the western bay of the warm room (now divided by\na partition) two doorways open north to the hot room, which\nlies to the west of the cold room. A stone bench against the west\nwall contains two marble washbasins. In the north-west corner\nstands a deep plunge-bath filled with cold water, which is\nreferred to in the wagfiyya as tashtiyya. The hot room is roofed\nlike the others by a perforated dome, here supported on\nsquinches. In the north-west corner of the room a window and\n\n a door open beside the plunge-bath to a small irregular vaulted\nannex furnished with another marble washbasin.\n\nA protrusion in the middle of the west wall of the hot room\ncovers the furnace. Above this protrusion are two windows\nthrough which steam issues from a boiler placed above and\naround the furnace (fig. 24.5).\n\nThe furnace is stoked from a vaulted service area to the\nwest, which is reached by a passageway from a smoke-\nblackened pointed-arched doorway in the south side of the\nmarket-street at bay 16. An iwdn-like barrel vaulted recess in\nthe southern part of the service area would hold a substantial\nquantity of fuel (probably animal dung). The boiler is now oil-\nfired. The floors of the hot and cold rooms were heated by\nexhaust gases from the furnace ducted under the floors to a flue\nin the east wall of the cold room (see fig. 24.19).\n\nThe original method of supplying water to the boiler\nappears complicated. At the north end of the boiler a\npassageway (see fig. 24.5) can be seen to lead off in the\n direction of the vertical shaft that was explored and described\nin the nineteenth century. This shaft descends about 25.5m\nfrom the roof of the bath-house to a long passage leading\nsouthwards, perhaps originally to connect with the same water\nsupply that fed the Ablutions Place.” By the nineteenth century\nthe level of water in this passage was erratic, varying according\nto the season.” When the level at the bottom of the shaft was\nlow someone had to descend the shaft and carry water from a\ndeeper pool at the end of the passage. The wagfiyya states that\nthe bath-house was supplied by the main aqueduct from\nSolomon’s Pools (ganat known as al-‘Arrab), which Tankiz was\nresponsible for restoring in 728/1328.”! At any rate, water was\ndrawn from the passage up the shaft to a well-house on the roof\nof the bath-house (plate 24.23). A system of runnels carried\nwater from the well-house across the roof, presumably to\nsupply the fountain in the changing room and the boiler.\nNowadays the bath is connected to the city’s water main.\nWaste water was drained into gutters, one around the\n fountain (see above) and one that runs along the east wall of the\nhot room and then along the north and east walls of the warm\nroom to a drain in the south-east corner of that room, which is\npresumably connected to the same sewer that serves the\nAblutions Place,\n(ti) Hammam al-‘Ayn (plan, fig. 24.4; section, fig. 24.16)\nTankiz\'s waqfiyya refers to this as the Western Bath. It is\nsituated at the west end of the market-street, immediately south\nof the shops at bays 1-3. The orientation of this bath-house is\nnormal. Its ground floor is about 1.6m below the level of the\nStreet, Tariq al-Wad, but this need not indicate that the bath is\nbuilt on older remains (which might have retained an early\nfloor level while the level of the street rose with the\naccumulation of debris over the years). In fact it is not unusual\nfor medieval bath-houses to be lower than their surroundings,\napparently in order to facilitate water supply and possibly also\nto improve thermal insulation.»\n\nThe entrance to the bath-house is from Tariq al-Wad, 3m\n south of the western entrance to the market-street, where a\nrelatively modern porch (see plate 24.3) now shelters the plain\nentrance door which leads down a flight of eight steps to a door\nopening south into the changing room. The vault above the\nsteps protrudes into the shop above (p/ate 24.24) at bay 1 of the\nmarket-street (see section, fig. 24.16).\n\nThe changing room is roofed by a dome on double-\nfaceted pendentives. A circular oculus opens at the crown (see\nplate 24.25). Under the oculus an octagonal stone tank contains\na fountain composed of a prismatic stone bowl on a short\nmarble shaft (see plate 24.26). In each side of the room three\nsteps lead up to raised platforms set in pointed-arched recesses\nwhere customers dress and undress and may relax after\nbathing.\n\nTwo segmental-arched openings in the back wall of the\nwest recess (plate 24.26) admit to booths that once gave on the\nstreet, Tariq al-Wad. These booths belong to a series of shops,\nfour on each side of the street, forming a small market. The date\n —\n\nof construction of this market is not known, but the conjunction\n\neast side of the street\nthe introduction of the\nast walls and the partial\n blocking of their archways on the street to form new windows.\n\nFrom the changing room a door in the south-west oe\nleads into a corridor running from east to west. At the west en\nof the corridor a dog-leg passage runs south then west to a\nsmall cubicle with a perforated dome, which contains a re\nAt the east end of the corridor a door opens to a small dome\nroom now full of rubbish. This room would appear originally\nto have been the cold bathing room.\n Fig. 24.10 Hammam al-Shifa’ well-shaft: Section looking east inc\n1849, Woolcott (Williams, Holy City, ii, 457 f.); 1853 (Nov. 19), Barclay (City of the Great King, 1857, 528 f.);\n\n1863, Whitty (Proposed Water Supply & Sewerage for Jerusalem); 1864 (Oct. 29), Wilson (Ordnance Survey Notes, 85, pl. xxii).\nThe assistance of Dr John Landgraff is also gratefully acknowledged.\n\norporating results of the following surveys:\n market-street (NON Sige)\n\nIn the south wall of the corridor a door opens on the\ncentral axis of the warm and hot bathing areas. It leads directly\ninto the principal warm room, roofed by a perforated dome on\nsquinches (plate 24.27). On the east and west sides of this room\nwide archways open into subsidiary warm rooms, also roofed\nby perforated domes (see plate 24.28). The western subsidiary\nroom has a stone bench against the side and back walls; other\nstone benches flank doorways in the north and south walls of\nthe principal warm room. The archway into the eastern room is\nnow partly blocked by a modern concrete wall (plate 24.29)\nand the dome replaced with a concrete slab.\n\nThe wagqfiyya records that the floor of the bath-house was\noriginally paved with coloured marble. Now only a small\nfragment of the original floor survives in the western subsidiary\nroom (plate 24.30). This shows the original greyish marble\nfloor to have been bordered by a band of beautiful polychrome\nmarble mosaic arranged in star patterns.\n\nThe door in the middle of the south wall of the principal\nwarm room leads to the principal hot room. Doors in the east\nand west walls of this room open into subsidiary hot rooms.\nThe principal room is octagonal in plan (fig. 24.4) with arched\nrecesses in diagonally opposing corners. This layout of an\noctagonal room with subsidiary rooms on two sides is typical of\nwarm, not hot, rooms in Ayyabid baths in Damascus,” a fact\nwhich, together with the exiguousness of the cold room, might\nsuggest that in Hammam al-‘Ayn the present hot rooms were\nonce warm rooms and that an earlier hot room to the south was\nsubsequently replaced by the present service area. However,\napart from the layout of these rooms there is nothing in the\npresent structure to suggest that there was ever a hot room to\nthe south.\n\nThe perforated dome and transition zone of the principal\nhot room are specially elaborate (plate 24.31). The dome is\ndivided into sixteen fluted sectors, expressed also on the\nexterior (see plate 24.25). The base of each sector is marked by\na pointed-arched niche. The recesses in the north-west, north-\neast and south-east corners of the room contain marble\n WasNDasins (See Ppidle 44.54). Lhe recess in te south-west\ncorner accommodates a plunge-bath. From the middle of the\nsouth wall protrudes the upper section of the flue from the\nfurnace (see below), above which is a small pointed-arched\nwindow (see plate 24.32) issuing steam from the boiler. A\ngutter in the floor runs north from this end of the room along\nthe central axis of the bathing areas to a drain in the corridor\nand, presumably, from there to a sewer under the street to the\nwest. The subsidiary hot rooms, rectangular in plan, have\ncurious gabled recesses in their north and south walls\ncontaining marble basins flanked by stone benches (plate\n24.33). The domes of these rooms rest on corner squinches\ntypical of medieval bath-houses (plate 24.35), including a\nparticularly distinctive intersecting-arch type in the eastern\nroom (plate 24.34).\n\nTo the west of the western subsidiary room a large water\ntank was uncovered during the recent restoration work. This\ntank, storing water presumably drawn from a branch of the\nmain aqueduct (see p. 286 n. 54 above), seems originally to\nhave supplied the bath-house (and subsequently an Ottoman\nsabi?’ on the street).\n\nThe service area, including the furnace and boiler, is\nsituated to the south of the hot rooms and reached only from\nthe street, Tariq al-Wad. There, some 24m south of the entrance\nto the bath-house proper, a low vault opens on the east side of\nthe street. This vault appears to have served as a fuel store. An\nopening in its north wall gives access to the furnace. An upper\nvault, above the fuel store, also has an Opening to the furnace\nand, above that, an aperture to the boiler over the furnace. A\nflue protrudes into the principal hot room then runs in a duct\nunder the floors of that room and the warm room toa chimney\nrising in the thickness of the north wall of the corridor.\nInvestigation of the  interrelationship between _ these\ncomponents of the heating system, shown in section in Jig.\n24.16, was made possible by an explosion that caused the boiler\nto be shut down. The modern use of oil to fire the boiler had\nled to a build-up of soot in the flue sufficient to block it and so\n\ncause the explosion. According to the proprietor this was a not\nuncommon occurrence.\n AVULLOS\n\n1 Al-‘Umari, who saw the place less than ten years after its completion, called it\na qaysariyya.

Somewhere in the vicinity was another khan,\ncalled Khan al-Ghadiriyya. The location of this khan, which was a waqf of the\nGhadiriyya Madrasa (see below, p. 527) is given variously as: ‘below (bi-sufl) Bab\nal-Qattanin’ (Sijill 2, no. 200); ‘at Bab al-Qattanin’ (Sijill 12, no. 408), and ‘in Bab\n al-Qattanin district’ (Sijill 17, no. 1020; Sijill 100, 120).

Herzfeld, ‘Etimologia d’al\nqaisariyya’, Oriente Moderno, 1962, 691). Its precise denotation is not clearly\nestablished, however. Van Berchem (CIA (Ville), 300) suggests ‘a square building\nin the form of a cloister, which encloses rooms, shops and boutiques for\nmerchants’. A characteristic of qaysariyyas is that they were covered (L.\nHautecoeur and G. Wiet, Les mosquées du Caire, Paris, 1932, 108; MAE, ii, 204)\nthough not necessarily closed, as has been suggested (D. and J. Sourdel, L’Islam\nclassique, Paris, 1968, 401). The Siiq al-Qattanin could not be closed (see p. 279).\nQaysariyyas generally housed precious goods, notably costly stuffs like silk and\ncotton. Thus ‘a covered market for precious goods’ might serve as a translation if\nnot a definition. The historical sources are reviewed by A. Raymond and G.

The composite\nmasonry of the portico shows how it was rebuilt. Of the last four\npiers at the western end of the earlier portico (see above, p.\n107) the westernmost survives, another has been replaced and\nthe two flanking its replacement were incorporated into new\nmassive piers built to support the madrasa. These sloping-\ntopped composite piers extend upwards to form buttresses\nframing the madrasa’s main facade. That the pier between them\nreplaces an earlier one may be deduced from the distance\nbetween the centres of the earlier parts of the flanking piers,\n Plate <0.< Foundation inscription with tanking blazons Ot juKanaar\n\n9.28m, which is double the average ‘pitch’ of the rest of the\nearlier portico. Above that intermediate pier the foundation\ninscription and flanking blazons of the Jakandar (plate 26.2)\nwere inserted when the madrasa was completed.\n\nThe westernmost bay of this portico now supports part of\nthe Is‘ardiyya (no. 33) but its roof must initially have been\nunbuilt on, forming a forecourt to the main entrance in the west\nwall of the Almalikiyya. Against the end of that westernmost bay\nTises an entrance staircase (plate 26.1). It leads to a small\nlanding from where one flight continues to the Is‘ardiyya and\nanother branches eastward to the entrance of the Almalikiyya\n (plate 26.3). The masonry above the staircase entrance differs\nfrom that of the portico (see fig. 26.6), suggesting that the rising\ntunnel vault covering the staircase was concomitant with the\nconstruction of the Is‘ardiyya.\n\nHARAM FACADE (fig. 26.6, plate 26.1)\n\nThe facade of the Almalikiyya is framed by the two buttresses\nthat extend upwards from the supporting piers. In this way the\nfrontage of the madrasa is integrated with the portico below to\nform an impressive two-storey facade. The conjunction of the\ntwo storeys is articulated by a moulded string course. At the top\nof the facade a two-tiered mu:quarnas canopy surmounted bya\ncornice moulding which extended between the buttresses\n(plate 26.4) was largely destroyed between 1893 and 1914 by\nvegetation rooted in the interstices between the stones.*?\n\nBetween the flanking buttresses under the muqarnas\ncanopy the facade is 0.25m in recess. It is built of red and cream-\ncoloured ablag. A large, grilled rectangular window in the\ncentre of the main facade is flanked by lower, narrower grilled\nwindows and surmounted by an oculus. These windows\nbelong to the assembly hall. A shallow moulding (fig. 10f)\nsurrounds the ablaq relieving arches of the two flanking\nwindows and extends over the lintel of the central window,\nabove which it turns in a tight loop before encircling the ablaq\nradial voussoirs of the oculus (plate 26.1). Several voussoirs\nand part of the moulding around the oculus were restored and\nthe masonry of the facade repointed in 1982.\n\nA broad string course, slightly recessed, runs across the\nmain facade above the oculus onto the face of the flanking\nbuttresses. There it terminates in a decorative manner,\ninterlocking with the adjoining masonry in a joggled joint\nwhich extends vertically to define the ends of narrow red-\ncoloured stone courses above and below the recessed\ncourse(plate 26.4).\n\nThe Haram frontage includes a short projection to the west\nbeyond the western buttress. Here there are two windows\nplaced one above the other; the lower window is small and\nrectangular, the upper larger and arched. The masonry of the\nupper part of the buttress extends west on the same plane to\nform the jambs and pointed arch of the upper window (fig.\n26.6). The sill of this window is a projecting slab spanning\nbetween the buttress and a single corbel on the west side. The\nwall below the sill has been set back 0.35m from the face of the\nbuttress in an apparent effort to avoid disrupting the symmetry\nof the facade. The west wall is concealed by the Is‘ardiyya, built\nhard against the madrasa.\n\nENTRANCE (plates 26.3 and 26.5)\nThe entrance proper to the madrasa is on the cramped upper\n\n) PaaS PER Re ay eS ges pert e aed 1G Tomy Bain SRS PORN R RENN Rs Siw ee Bee CREE an EO\n adjacent Is‘ardiyya, forms a tiny patio open to the sky. The\ndoorway is ornamentally developed, set in a tall, narrow recess\nwith a mugarnas hood. Its red monolithic lintel is set back\nslightly, supported on moulded brackets and edged with a\nsimple border which continues upwards to frame a roundel\ncomposed of ten joggled ablaq voussoirs in the form of an\noculus. Four of the voussoirs are badly eroded, revealing the\nsuperficial nature of the joggling. The roundel is set back on the\nsame plane as the lintel and surrounded by a raised border\ninscribed within the square frame. Each of the four corners\nbetween the square frame and the circular border is\nemblazoned with the paired polo-sticks of the jakandar\nintaglioed in the grey stone veneer as if to receive a paste\nfilling.\n\nThe hood consists of three tiers of curvilinear mugarnas\nculminating in two small conchs with stubby stalactite elements\nat their apexes. Above the uppermost tier of muqarnas runs a\nhorizontal moulding identical in profile to (but at a lower level\nthan) the cornice moulding which complements the Haram\nfacade.\n\nThe narrowness of the entrance portal suggests that the\nspace available for it was restricted. To the north (see plan, Jig.\n 20.4) lies part of the four-metres thick wall associated with the\nTower Antonia (above, p. 204), which would have formed an\neffective boundary. But what the wall forming the southern\nboundary belonged to is not at all clear. The room beyond it is\npart of the Is‘ardiyya, which must have been built after the\nAlmalikiyya.\n\nVESTIBULE\n\nThe entrance door opens into a dark vestibule connecting with\nboth the assembly hall and, by way of an intermediate chamber\nwith a window opening into the tomb chamber, a tunnel-\nvaulted cell at the south-west corner of the courtyard.\n\nASSEMBLY HALL (fig. 26.4)\n\nThe assembly hall overlooks the Haram through three\nwindows constructed in ablaq masonry whose coursing\nmatches that of the exterior facade (plate 26.9). The soffits of\nthe two lateral window embrasures are of stucco carved with an\narrangement of stalactites around two eight-pointed stars\nenclosing rosettes; both are identical except that the rosettes in\nthe western soffit are composed of sixteen radial petals, while\nthose in the eastern one (plate 26.6) have sixteen whorled\n petals. The soffit of the central window is undecorated, but the\nsill is inlaid with polychrome marble strapwork (plate 26.7),\nabsent in the lateral windows.\n\nThe oculus above the central window is ringed by a\ndecorative inlay of six intersecting circles of black stone cut off\nby the central opening to form six interlaced lobes (fig. 26.7).\"!\nThe mason responsible for this decoration may have copied it\nfrom analogous eight-lobed designs on two earlier monuments\nin Damascus, the Zahiriyya Madrasa (676/1277)” and the\nTakritiyya Turba (c.698/1299).* Extra light was admitted to the\nhall by a domed octagonal lantern at the crown of the high\nfolded cross vault. The eight pointed-arched windows of the\nlantern have been blocked and the roof repaved with the result\nthat all but the tops of the arches are concealed (fig. 26.8 shows\nthe lantern as it must have looked before the repaving of the\nroof). The dome appears to be constructed of ablaq masonry\nunusually arranged in spiralling courses, visible on the interior\n(fig. 26.7, plate 26.8). The exterior is cement-rendered.\n\nTransverse arches springing from muqarnas imposts span\nthe east and west ends of the hall. With the exception of the\nablaq-decorated south wall, the walls and vaulting of the hall\nare plastered.\n In the south-west corner a narrow door opens into a small\nvaulted room with a window overlooking the Haram. A recess\nin the west wall of this room may originally have been a\nwindow which was subsequently blocked by the adjoining\nIs‘ardiyya. At the north wall of the hall the marble jambs and\nlintel of a blocked window protrude through the plaster; this\nwindow originally opened into the tomb chamber (see below).\nIn the centre of the north wall, a door with exposed ablaq\n\njambs leads into a short passageway connecting the hall with\nthe courtyard.\n\nCOURTYARD\n\nThe layout of the cells around the courtyard is shown on the\nplan (fig. 26.4). There are doors opening off the courtyard at\nboth ends of each of the four enclosing walls (plate 26.10), and\nin addition there is one (see plate 26.11) in the centre of the\nsouthern wall (connecting with the assembly hall) and one in\nthe centre of the north wall (opening into a small cell). To\nenhance the symmetrical disposition, blind doors (plate 26.12)\nimitating the others have been added at the centre of the west\nand east walls. The horseshoe arches of the doorways have\nablaq voussoirs of alternately red and cream-coloured stone\n Fig. 26.7 East—west section through assembly hall looking\nsouth\n\nset back slightly within a chamfered frame cut in the\nsurrounding masonry. Slit windows with chamfered jambs and\ndelicately cusped heads are placed directly above the doors.\n\nThe tunnel-vaulted tomb chamber at the south-west\ncorner contains a marble-clad cenotaph set on a low plinth.\nThree corners of the cenotaph are fitted with stumpy marble\npillars which have typical Mamlik pointed bulbous finials; the\nfourth pillar has disappeared. The tomb chamber originally\nhad openings on all four sides. The windows in the south and\nwest walls of the tomb chamber have been referred to above;\nthe door from the courtyard, which is original, is in the north\nwall. Only the east wall is blank, but it is a later infilling.\n\nThe cell at the south-east corner has a small window in its\neastern wall admitting light from the light-well at the head of\nthe entrance staircase of the contiguous Farisiyya.\n\nAcourse of foundations (marked by a thin line on the plan,\nJig. 26.4) in the cell at the the southern end of the west wall may\nbe a trace of the Antonia (above, p. 43) of which more\nsubstantial remains have been isolated in the Is‘ardiyya and the\nJawiliyya Madrasa (no. 14).\n\nA long, dark corridor extends eastwards from the north-\n€ast corner of the courtyard and then turns north up to what is\n now a raised garden outside the northern limits of the madrasa.\nTwo northern chambers are entered off this corridor. A low\nopening in the wall separating these two vaulted chambers\nhouses a well-head opening into a cistern. The western\nchamber has in its north wall a blocked doorway which,\naccording to the present occupant of the building, once led to\na series of vaulted rooms under the garden. These rooms may\nbelong to the ribat mentioned above (p. 310) which was\nsituated to the north of the madrasa. A doorway (marked ‘X’ on\nthe plan) just to the right of the door from the corridor into the\ngarden (plate 26.13) also may be associated with that ribat. Its\ncloister vault is partly rebuilt. The area beyond the door was not\naccessible to us.\n\nThe walls of the corridor are unplastered but show no\ntrace of a door to the south, where our survey has revealed a\nlarge square-shaped structure with no apparent entrance. Its\nirregular orientation governs the alignment of the eastern\nboundary of that part of the madrasa which abuts on it, and\ntherefore it must have existed before the construction of the\nmadrasa. Yet the masonry of the south wall of the corridor is\nsmall and continuous, not unlike that of the north wall. It may\nmark the site of some fortification connected with the Tower\n Antonia but in the absence of further evidence its function and\nhistory remain a mystery.\n\nUPPER FLOOR (fig. 26.5)\n\nA staircase to the upper rooms of the madrasa is reached from\nthe courtyard by the same doorway that gives access to the\ncorridor. This staircase rises southward along the west side of\nthe mysterious structure described above. At upper floor level\na gallery projects over the west, north and east walls of the\ncourtyard, supported on handsome carved stone consoles of\ntwo types arranged alternately (plate 26.10).\n\nThe rooms at this level are laid out in much the same way\nas those on the lower level. The assembly hall rises the full\nheight of both storeys. The most noticeable difference is a long\nvaulted chamber which runs parallel with the north wall of the\nassembly hall, and a narrow southward extension of it parallel\nwith the west wall of the assembly hall. That long chamber and\nits southern extension have small windows pierced in,\n respectively, their south and east walls looking into the\nassembly hall at roughly the same high level as the oculus in the\nsouth wall of that hall (see plate 26.14). In addition, the long\nchamber has two windows facing north, while the southern\nextension has a small window in its west wall, opening on the\nlight-well over the entrance portal, and a pointed-arched\nwindow at its southern end (plate 26.15) overlooking the\nHaram (see above, p. 311).\n\nOn the north and west sides of the courtyard there are at\nthis level six cells, four entered from the northern gallery and\ntwo from the western gallery. In the north-west cell, entered\nfrom the western gallery, the rear wall has been breached to\nestablish a connection with the adjoining cell to the west, which\nis part of the Is‘ardiyya (plate 26.16).\n\nIsolated at the north-east corner of the complex are two\n\ndomed rooms (plate 26.17) which house a kitchen and a\nlatrine.\n Notes\n\n1 The transcription of Mamlak names from the ‘original’ Turkish into Arabic\ntended to produce a variety of divergent forms (J.M. Rogers, ‘The name Qawsiin’\nin Layla ‘Ali Ibrahim, ‘The great Hanqah of the Emir Qawstin in Cairo’, MDIK, xxx,\n1974, 57-60). Almalik is sucha case. Van Berchem first transliterated it as ‘Al-malik’\n(CIA (Le Caire), 170-71) and later as ‘Yl-malak’ (CIA (Ville), 267). Subsequently L.A.\nMayer argued in favour of ‘Almalik’ (Saracenic Heraldry, Oxford, 1933, 60). In\nAhmad Zaki’s edition of al-‘Umari, Masdlik, ‘Almalik’, the spelling we have\nadopted here, is used, while Mujir al-Din calls him simply ‘Malik’ and refers to his\nmadrasa in Jerusalem as ‘al-Malikiyya’, doubtless reflecting the popular\nnomenclature of his day.\n\n2 Al-‘Umari, Masdlik, 159.\n\n3 Mujir, ii, 38.\n\n4 CIA (Ville), no. 82.\n\n5 For biographical information, see W4fi, ix, 312-3; Nuj., v, 47.

Mayer, Saracenic Heraldry, Oxford, 1933, pl. xliv, 2.\n\n41 This type of decoration composed of interlaced lobes around a circle was\nrelatively more common in the minor arts, notably metalwork, where the smaller\nscale would allow the compass-drawn pattern to be drafted easily (e.g. the\ncelebrated mid-seventh/thirteenth-century brass wallet from Northern\nMesopotamia in the Courtauld Galleries: see B.W. Robinson ‘Oriental Metalwork\nin the Gambier-Parry Collection’, The Burlington Magazine, March, 1967, 169-73,\npls. 81-83).\n\nIn an architectural context there are, apart from the two earlier Damascus\nexamples, analogous but later examples at the Mosque of Sultan Hasan\n(757-64/1356-62) in Cairo and at the Ulu Cami (787/1385-86) in Manisa in\nSouth-west Anatolia (M. Meinecke, Die mamlukische Architektur in Agypten und\nSyrien (648/1250 bis 923/1517), p. 156 of typescript).\n\nA similar motif was popular for decorating the haunches of arches,\nespecially in Syria and Anatolia. An incomplete series of examples is illustrated by\nE. Herzfeld, CIA (Alep), pl. cix, and idem, ‘Damascus: Studies in Architecture — II’,\nAl, x, 1943, fig. 83, to which should be added the unpublished early example\n(carved, not inlaid) over the double window of the North Minaret (before 580/\n1184: see EMA, i”, 177) of the Great Mosque in Damascus. In Palestine there are\nseveral examples on mibrabs, most if not all of which were probably the work of\ncraftsmen from Damascus: in Jerusalem at the Qubbat al-Silsila (mibrab dated\n659-71/1261-73) and the Tankiziyya Madrasa (729/1329); in Hebron at the Masjid\nof Sanjar al-Jawili (720/1320) and the Haram (mibrab dated 732/1331-32); and in\nGaza at the Jami‘ of Ibn ‘Uthman (méhrab dated 834/1430-31). In Cairo there are\nalso several examples: e.g. at the so-called Mausoleum of Mustafa Pasha (¢.666-72/\n1267-73: see MAE, ii, pl. 55a); the Aqbughawiyya Madrasa (740/1339: see The\nMinistry of Waqfs, The Mosques of Egypt, Cairo, 1949, pl. 59); and an anonymous\ntomb tentatively ascribed to the Amir Bashtak (c.740/1339-40: see M.

Since al-‘Umari accurately\ndescribes both the mihrab and the two-tiered dome but not the\nstaircase, we can assume that the staircase was added some time\nafter 745/1345.\n\nThe two-tiered dome (plates 27.2 and 27.3) is composed\nalmost entirely of Crusader sculpture of the highest quality,\napparently taken from some Latin ciborium or baldacchino. It\nhas often been described,’ most recently and exhaustively by\nBuschhausen.° The date of re-assembly of this Crusader\nsculpture into its present form is not known except that it must\nhave been some time before 745/1345 when al-‘Umari\ndescribed it; most likely it was towards the end of the sixth/\ntwelfth century at the time of the Ayytbid purging and\nreconsecration of the Haram (see above, p. 48).’ The only\nobviously non-Crusader element is the marble ceiling of the\nquadrilateral base, which is decorated with a low-relief\nstrapwork frieze in typical Ayyabid or Mamlak style.\n\nIt seems probable that the wooden structure on wheels\nthat Mujir al-Din was told of (see above) was actually a flight of\nsteps that could be wheeled up to the two-tiered dome when it\nwas to be used as a pulpit. The replacement of this ad hoc\ncontrivance by a stone staircase was presumably the object of\nBurhan al-Din’s ‘restoration’ in the eighth/fourteenth century.\nAn early nineteenth-century engraving illustrates the pulpit as it\nwas before the restoration of 1259/1843. This engraving (fig.\n27.2) shows that much of the present staircase, including the\nmarble balustrade carved in low-relief with panels of\nstrapwork, existed before the 1259/1843 restoration. What that\nlater restoration appears to have involved was the blocking of\na tall rectangular opening flanked by columns under both sides\nof the upper part of the staircase and the fitting in their place of\nvertical panels of marble decorated with Ottoman-style’\nroundels including two with crescent-and-star motifs (see plate\n 1 Al-Umari, Masdlik, 145.\n\n2 Mujir, 373.\n\n3 Mujir, 453.\n\n4 CIA (Haram), 212 n. 4.\n\n5 See, for example, CIA (Haram), 211-16;J. Strzygowski, ‘Ruins of Tombs of the\nLatin Kings on the Haram in Jerusalem’, Speculum, xi, 1936, 501-2; and T.S.R.\nBoase, ‘Ecclesiastical Art in the Crusader States in Palestine and Syria’ and J. Folda,\n‘Painting and Sculpture in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem 1099-1291’, A History\nof the Crusades, iv, ed. by H.W. Hazard, general ed. K.M. Setton, Madison,\nWisconsin, 1977, 89, 271.\n\n6 H. Buschhausen, Die stiditalienische Bauplastik im KOnigreich Jerusalem,\nVienna, 1978, 225-32, figs. 243-92.\n 27.2). Also part of that restoration was the replacement of the\noriginal entrance to the staircase by the present entrance\nsurmounted by the inscription stela.\n\nIn short, then, little but the steps and balustrade of this\ncharming structure, now usually referred to as the Minbar of\nBurhan al-Din, appears to belong to the restoration made by\nthat ga@di in the eighth/fourteenth century.\n 7 The style of the Crusader sculpture in the pulpit is similar to that re-used on\nthe qibla wall of the Aqsa Mosque, redecorated in 583/1187-88 by Saladin. The\ninternal faces of the voussoirs of the horseshoe arches in the quadrilateral base of\nthe pulpit have curious annular grooves which closely resemble analogous\ngrooves in the voussoirs of the main mibrab of the Aqsa Mosque, also dated 583/\n1187-88.\n\n8 A wooden minbar on wheels is reported to have been used in the Great\nMosque of Cordova in the tenth century (F.H. Jiménez, ‘El almimbar movil del\nsiglo X de la mezquita de Cordoba’, Al-Andalus, xxiv, 1959, 381-99) and a similar\nminbar was made by a craftsman from Ahlat in eastern Anatolia in 50/1155 for the\nGreat Mosque in Algiers (E. Kiihnel, Die islamische Kunst, Leipzig, 1929, 432).\n ',''),(28,'STREET FACADE (fig. 28.3)\nThe street facade contains two windows set in shallow recesses,\n0.12m deep, separated by a central stone pier bearing the\ndedicatory inscription (translated above). The heads of the\nrecesses are spanned by cyma recta mouldings with downturns\nat the outer ends.’\n\nThe whole facade is framed by a quirked ogee moulding\nwith a distinctive frieze® of fretted lobes protruding inwards\nfrom it in such a way that the lobes carved in relief are matched\nin mirror image by the excised lobes between them to form a\ncontinuously repeating pattern (see plate 28.1). In the lateral,\nvertical runs these lobes follow a ‘module’ provided by the\nstone coursing, the larger (mostly lower) courses bearing three\nlobes in relief and the smaller ones two. Since the lobes are\nregular in size and the stones on which they are carved do not\nconsistently course through with the stonework of the rest of\nthe facade it would appear that these stones were carved off the\nsite in some mason’s yard. The same sort of ‘modular’ carving\noccurs also at the top and bottom horizontal runs of the\nmoulding. Some coordination between the moulding carvers\nand the builders must have existed, however, for the bottom\nrun is articulated around the bases of the window recesses.\n\nThe window jambs are of red and cream-coloured ablaq;\n elsewhere the construction is entirely of plain limestone.\nAbove each window lintel is a larger stone, slightly undercut\nalong the base as if to relieve the load on the lintel, and\nelaborately carved with various star and palmette patterns.\nAbove each of these ornamental relieving lintels is a panel of\nanalogous carving, recessed about 0.03m from the surface of\nthe recess. On the pier between the two recesses are two more\npanels of low-relief carving. The lower one is of strapwork\naround a central rosette and the upper one is the dedicatory\ninscription.\n\nAsingle course of stones forms a later parapet on top of the\nfacade. This parapet obscures most of the dome from view\nthough the apex can still be seen from the street. The dome sits\non an octagonal drum, each side of which is pierced by a\npointed-arched slit housing a rectangular window (plate 28.2).\nAlternate windows were blind, only four being open originally.\nA later structure encroaches on the drum and dome from the\nnorth (plate 28.3) and now only two windows remain open. A\ncavetto moulding marks the exterior transition from the drum\nto the dome. The dome is somewhat shallow in profile, built of\nrubble masonry rendered with a sort of water-resistant plaster\nof which traces survive. A carved stone finial completes the\ndesign (plate 28.2).\n\nINTERIOR (plan, fig. 28.2; sections, figs. 28.4—28.6)\n\nThe original entrance from the west is blocked and the left-\nhand window in the facade has been converted to serve as a\ndoorway. It opens directly into the domed chamber. The floor\nis paved with rough stone flags, presumably replacing an\nearlier pavement.\n\nFrom moulded imposts wall arches span the south, west\nand east sides, and a deep recess opens in‘the north side (plate\n28.4). That recess now has an opening in its rear wall into a\ncross-vaulted room. The irregular masonry of the jambs and\nsegmental arch of this opening show it to be a later insertion.\nThe room to which it gives access appears to be an earlier\nstructure. It has a blocked opening, evidently the door that\noriginally gave access to it from the north. In the middle of the\nfloor is a stone cenotaph; there is none in the domed chamber.\nIt seems reasonable to surmise that this cenotaph (plate 28.5)\noriginally marked a grave in the usual place directly under the\ndome, though no sign of sucha grave exists now, and that it was\nremoved to the adjoining room when the building was taken\nover for domestic use.’ Perhaps it was at the same time that the\noriginal entrance door in the west wall of that chamber was\nblocked up (see plate 28.6).\n\nLike the facade, the interior is decorated with panels of\nlow-relief carving, one in the tympanum of each wall arch and\none at the back of the north recess (figs. 28.4—28.6). On the\nsouth side there is in addition an interesting mibrab (plate\n28.7) on the internal face of the pier between the two windows.\nIt is badly eroded now but enough survives to establish its\noriginal form: a flat recess 0.07m deep surmounted by a\npointed arch with gadrooning in the tympanum, pseudo-\nvoussoirs carved to represent a strange form of joggling, and\nfoliate scrollwork in the spandrels (plate 28.8).\n The eight-sided drum rests on  double-faceted\npendentives which taper down to bevelled points between\nadjoining wall arches® (plate 28.9). Each side of the drum had\na shallow pointed-arched recess, alternate ones originally\n CIA (Ville), no. 84.\n\nKoran iii, verse 185, or xxi, verse 35, or xxix, verse 57.\n\nFor a discussion of the reading of the names, see GIA (Ville), 274, notes 2-4.\nHence the appellation ‘martyr’. For a full discussion, see CIA (Ville), 273-6.\n\nThe profile of this moulding is reminiscent of the one formerly over the street\nfacade of the Dawadariyya (above, p. 157).\n being pierced by unusually small slit windows (see sections,\nfigs. 28.4-28.6). Between the recesses little double-faceted\npendentives make the transition from the octagonal drum to\nthe circular base of the dome. Both drum and dome are coated\nwith plaster.\n\nDATE OF CONSTRUCTION\n\nScrutiny of the structure tends to indicate that the tomb was\nbuilt on the remains of some earlier building. Van Berchem\n(cited above, p. 321) speculated that the tomb itself was an\nexisting structure purchased after Turkaén Khatiin’s death to\nserve as her funerary monument. There is, however, no real\nevidence that this was the case. The building has the typical\ndomed cube form of a Mamluk tomb and it seems very unlikely\nthat there were builders in Jerusalem erecting tombs as\nspeculative ventures in the absence of a specific commission.\nNevertheless, the profusion and variety of carved ornamental\npanels, together with the suggestive ‘modular’ treatment of the\nfretted frame moulding, implies some sort of practical\ncommercial transaction, as if the designs had been chosen from\na monumental mason’s pattern book. It is not beyond the\nbounds of possibility that following the death of Turkan Khatiin\nthe tomb was commissioned from a contract builder. At any\nrate there is nothing in the architecture to suggest that it was not\nbuilt specifically as a funerary monument for Turkan Khatin, in\nwhich case it should be dated shortly after her death in 753/\n1352-53.\n 6 Asimilar type of fretted frieze is found at the well-niche of the Is‘ardiyya (below,\np. 378).\n\n7 See above, p. 321. sree\n\n8 There are similar bevelled points at the bases of pendentives in the domed\nreception hall of the Manjakiyya (below, p. 391).\n ','STREET FACADE, INTERIOR, DATE'),(30,'The founder obviously had an eye for economy: having\nappropriated with few if any modifications the Crusader annex\nto the Aqsa Mosque (the second of the ‘two Farisiyya Madrasas’)\nhe then proceeded to insert his madrasa into a site where three\nof the four exterior walls were already standing.\n\nThe madrasa and possibly also the portico supporting it\nmust have collapsed at some later date, presumably during an\nearthquake. The Ottoman rebuilding on the site of the madrasa\nis arranged to provide comfortable domestic accommodation.\n\nHARAM FRONTAGE (fig. 30.5, plate 30.1)\nMujir al-Din states that the ancient portico under the Aminiyya\nwas reconstructed in 610/1213-14. The piers of that Ayyabid\nreconstruction survive, but apart from a fragmentary cornice\nmoulding and the springers of the left-hand (western) arch the\nremainder of the frontage appears to have been rebuilt. Certain\ndetails of the structure and its scanty decoration — notably the\ndouble row of voussoirs over each of the three arches of the\nportico and the ‘fretwork’ ornament over the right-hand\nwindow lintel at the upper floor level (visible in plate 30.1) -—\nare manifestly Ottoman, and the uniformity of the masonry\nabove the arches of the portico implies a unity of construction.\nThe sloping-topped central piers have short vertical\nextensions, also with sloping tops, added to buttress the wall.\nThe rebuilt portico was blocked up some time before\n19147! save for rectangular windows in the two left-hand arches\nand the open tympanum of the right-hand arch. Under the\nportico the rear (north) wall is plastered and devoid of\narchitectural features; the Antonia rock scarp begins\nhereabouts to rise above the level of the ground.\n PIAS OV.T Malalll POMlLAYGeS OF AITTIGUALY Ya\n\n(left) and Farisiyya (right)\n\nENTRANCE COMPLEX\n\nThe entrance to the Farisiyya is situated under the portico\nwhich sustains the Almalikiyya. There, a simple doorway opens\nin the north wall of the Haram built on the Antonia rock scarp,\nwhich at this point stands about 2.50m above the level of the\nHaram esplanade. A stairway of three flights, sheltered by the\nportico, rises to a landing in front of this elevated doorway (fig.\n30.6). The space under the landing was formerly utilized for a\nsmall closet, but it is blocked now.”\n\nBeyond the entrance doorway a narrow passage (plate\n30.2) leads up to a low, dark chamber apparently partly cut into\nthe rock (fig. 30.4). This must be the Zawiyat al-Lawi which al-\n‘Umari located thus“. . . after (the two windows of the Aminiyya)\n comes a door through which one goes up to the Zawiyat al-\nLawi.”? Mujir al-Din makes no mention of the zawiya, which\nmay by then have been incorporated into the Farisiyya.\nTherefore the stairway under the portico and the passage must\nhave belonged initially to the zawiya before Faris al-Din made\nuse of them for access to his madrasa. The staircase rising\ntowards the east past the zawiya may also have existed prior to\nthe construction of the madrasa. It leads directly up to a\nforecourt by the madrasa’s original entrance, now enclosed\nwithin a later room (A). The southern extension of the staircase\n(plate 30.3) appears to be a later addition; it connects with a\npassage cut through the Haram wall to replace the original\nentrance to the madrasa, which is blocked.\n That original entrance doorway is hewn out of the Haram\nwall and, though blocked, retains its simple pointed-arched\nprofile. It seems to be the only structural feature of the Mamlak\ndevelopment to have survived at this level. All the other\nconstruction appears to be Ottoman with the exception of the\nHaram wall itself (which actually projects here above the roof,\nas shown in plate 30.4) and the possible exception of the\n impenetrable offset structure which may mark the site of some\nfortificiation connected with the ancient Tower Antonia (see\nabove, p. 315).\n\nINTERIOR DECORATION\n\nA quantity of marble, presumably the remains of wall panelling\nused to decorate the original madrasa, is incorporated in the\nOttoman assemblage paving the floor (plate 30.5). This\nincludes two pieces of a rectangular plaque (plates 30.6 and\n30.7) carved with an exquisite foliate decoration in the shape of\na pointed ovoid, each of the points having a trefoil finial, linked\nto a rectangular border whose corners are similarly decorated.\nThis type of ornament occurs fairly frequently in Bahri Mamltk\nmarble wall panelling and in Jerusalem there are other\nexamples, all attributable to the Amir Tankiz, surviving in two\nmonuments: the Tankiziyya Madrasa (no. 18) and the Aqsa\nMosque (730/1330-31).* The carved design on the fragments in\nthe Farisiyya, similar to those in the Aqsa Mosque, is identical to\nthose in the Tankiziyya (plate 18.16), which both appear to be\n the work of the same craftsman. Faris al-Din may well have\nretrieved one or more panels from the east wall of the Aqsa\nMosque during the works he supervised there in 751/1350-51\n(above, p. 337). In that case Tankiz’s marble panelling in the\nAqsa Mosque would be more extensive than was previously\n\nthought.\n 1 Since he died in 749/1349.\n2 Mujir, ii, 38-9.\n3, Al-‘Umari, Masdlik, 158 (and also 151).\n4 Mujir, loc. cit.\n5 Defter 602, 450.\n6 Durar, i, 432, and Mujir, loc. cit.\n7 al-Shuja\'t, i, 271.\n8 Wiistenfeld, Chroniken, ii, 53 and 128.\n9 Sultik, ii, 821 and 840.\n10 Sulitk, ii, 850-5 and 868.\n11 Wéft, ix, 352; Durar, loc. cit.\n12 Khitat, ii, 393.

These were a plain door into the assembly hall and\na grilled window to the tomb chamber. The door has been\nconverted into a window and a new door has been opened into\nthe assembly hall, while the tomb chamber window has been\nmade into a door. The new door and windows of the assembly\nhall bear elaborate funerary inscriptions commemorating\nsome of the dignitaries buried in that hall, including\nMuhammad ‘Ali al-Hindi, who was the first to be buried there,\nin 1930.\n\nOther structures — with an elaborate facade on the Haram\n— stood on the roof of the portico until 1925 when they were\ndemolished.” It is not known exactly when these structures\nwere erected (see below).\n\nINTERIOR (plan, fig. 31.3)\nThe present entrance passageway from Tariq Bab al-Hadid was\nbuilt as part of the Arghtiniyya, which was completed in 759/\n 1358 (see below, p. 356). Nothing is known of an earlier\nentrance. The passageway, 14.45m long, leads south to a plain\ndoorway into a barrel-vaulted cell (marked ‘A’ on the plan),\nwhich serves as a sort of entrance vestibule. This cell originally\nopened south to the courtyard through a door in the middle of\nits south wall but this door has been blocked by the\nconstruction of a later, Ottoman staircase and replaced by a\nhigh-level window. Instead, two new doors give access to the\ncourtyard, one in the east wall, which is reached bya flight of six\nsteps up to the north zwdn, and one in the west wall, which\nleads through an adjoining cell (B) and from there under the\nlater staircase to the courtyard.\n\nThe courtyard is split from north to south on two levels,\nthe west end being lower than the east end. Much of this\ndifference in level is accounted for by an accumulation of\ndebris at the east end, where it covers the lower part of a\ndecorated ablaq facade. How far this facade continues below\nthe present surface level will be revealed only by excavation.\nNevertheless, the original threshold of a door in that facade is\ncalculated to be about 1.45m above the original lower\ncourtyard level (see below) and so to reach it a total of at least\nfive steps would have been needed. The reconstruction\nsuggested in fig. 31.9 shows three steps up to the door in\naddition to two steps dividing the courtyard.\n\nIn the middle of the courtyard there is a well-head made\nfroma hollowed column base giving access to a cistern below.\n\nThe layout of cells (A-K) around the courtyard is shown on\nthe plan, fig. 31.3. The doors and windows of most of these cells\nhave been rebuilt in recent years. (Two of the original pointed-\n arched doors, at the south-west corner of the courtyard, are\nvisible in Creswell’s 1920 photograph, plate 31.2.) The interiors\nof several cells have also been altered by the breaching or\nremoval of partition walls, and two cells (E and H) in the north-\nwest and south-west corners are no longer accessible. The door\nat the south end of the west wall leads to a small landing with a\nblocked door to the west and a stair rising south to the roof. A\nquirked ogee moulding forms a cornice above the cells around\nthe courtyard. The structures above this cornice are later,\nalmost certainly Ottoman, additions.\n\nAt the east end of the north and south walls the same\nmoulding forms a sort of impost supported by coupled elbow\nbrackets from which spring the arches of the two Zwans that\nconfront each other across this end of the courtyard. These\nelbow brackets (fig. 31.11) are most unusual features, though\nnot unique.” At the east end of the porch at the Aqsa Mosque a\nvirtually identical bracket is to be found, which is described by\nHamilton as a passable copy of the original (Crusader) brackets\nin the central bays of that porch.”* That copy is part of the\nrebuilding of the east end of the porch in 751/1350 under the\nsupervision of an Egyptian amir, ‘Izz al-Din Aybak al-Misri.”\nIndeed, the brackets at the Khatiniyya are so similar to the one\nat the Aqsa Mosque that we may infer with some confidence that\nthey were carved by the same mason, possibly shortly after\nwork at the Mosque was finished but in any case before 755/\n1354 when the Khatiiniyya was first endowed.\n\nThe frontal arches of the two iwéins are built of red and\ncream-coloured ablaq voussoirs, and the coursing of the ablaq\nmasonry in the spandrels is adjusted in order to have the lower\ncourses coincide with the extrados of voussoirs of the same\ncolour. A simple splay-face moulding runs across the top and\ndown the west spandrel of the north zwan; the south van has\nlost whatever frame moulding it might have had when a later\nbuilding was erected over it.\n The nortn 7Wan NOW Me€dsulo V.QOH TOT TOU LO DaCkK,\nbut Creswell’s photograph (plate 31.3) reveals that its rear\n(north) wall has been rebuilt some time after 1920. The back of\nthe marble lining of the mibrab of the Arghiniyya is exposed in\nthe north-east corner of the zwdm, indicating that the wall here\nis very thin indeed. Creswell’s photograph shows that the rear\nwall of the ivan was on the same alignment as the north wall\nof cell ‘A’. Immediately above the modern pavement at the\nnorth end of the east wall of the zvdn the masonry contains\nthree voussoirs of what seems to be the remains of an arch. It\nis not clear what the original purpose of this arch might have\nbeen unless it belonged to the pre-existing Sufi’s cell\nmentioned by al-‘Umari (see above). To the south of the arch is\na modern door (now blocked) that led into the tomb anteroom.\nThe original door is in a pointed-arched recess near the\nsouthern end of the wall.\n\nThe south iwdn is shallower than the north one, being\n3.65m from north to south. In the east wall is a pointed-arched\nrecess containing a grilled window (now blocked) that opened\nto the assembly hall. A crudely arched recess in the rear (south)\nwall contains a door into the east end of the passage giving\naccess to the lodgings (rub) on the north side of St al-\nQattanin (above, p. 280). Both door and recess appear to be\nmodern.\n\nThe decorated facade at the east end dominates the\ncourtyard (fig. 31.5). The lower part of the facade is built of red\nand cream-coloured ablaq masonry and continues some way\ninto the zwdns at either end. This part of the facade that is built\nof ablaq is framed by a quirked ogee moulding similar in\nprofile to the cornice above the cells, which extends\nhorizontally across the facade between the iwdms, then\ndescends vertically at either end and returns over coupled\nbrackets carrying the eastern springings of the zwan arches.\nFrom there it continues south into the south zwvdm and north\ninto the north zwdn. In the south wan it frames the recess\ncontaining the assembly hall window. In the north zwdan it\nextends across the recess containing the door into the tomb\nanteroom. Between these two arched recesses the facade\ncontains three openings (all blocked): a window to the tomb\nchamber and a window and door to the assembly hall (plate\n31.4). The two windows are each set in a shallow recess\n spanned by a pointed horseshoe arch. The tympanums are\ndecorated with an ablaq revetment radiating from a small\ncentral hub. The wall surface between the two arches is\ndecorated with a similar radial ablaq revetment, which\nenlivens this otherwise blank section of facade. The door into\nthe assembly hall is wider than the windows and is set in a\ncorrespondingly wider recess with matching radial revetment\nin the tympanum of its pointed arch. The lintels of all five\nOpenings are surmounted by ablag relieving arches.\n\nThe tops of stone benches flanking the assembly hall door\nprotrude approximately 0.30m above the surface of the packed\ndebris at this end of the courtyard; the original threshold level\n must be 0.35m or so below the present surface or, in other\nwords, about 1.13m above the present lower courtyard level.\nHowever, through a gap in the paving beside the entrance to\ncell ‘G’ at the west end of the courtyard may be seen earlier\npaving stones that presumably belong to the original pavement\n0.32m below the present pavement. Thus the threshhold of the\nassembly hall door appears to be about 1.45m above the\noriginal pavement in the west part of the courtyard.\n\nThe upper part of the facade is of plain limestone pierced\nby two pointed-arched windows, one lighting the assembly hall\nand one lighting the tomb chamber. The dome over the tomb\nchamber is raised on a tall circular drum. The dome itself\ncollapsed in the winter of 1919-2076 and at some later date the\ndrum was rebuilt one course higher and the dome replaced\n with a pitiful concrete cap that bears no resemblance to the\noriginal.””\n\nThe tomb chamber was reached by way of the anteroom\nfrom the recessed doorway in the north ivan (plate 31.5). The\narch of this doorway springs from inward-facing coupled\nelbow brackets. Each of these is attached to a similar coupled\nbracket facing west. On the right side the west-facing bracket\ncarries the opening arch of the zzvdn (plate 31.6), confronting\na similar bracket at the west springing of that arch. The bracket\non the left, having no arch to support, is structurally redundant.\nEach pair of coupled brackets is carved from a single block of\nstone. In the tympanum of the doorway a recessed panel with\nelaborately foliated ends appears to have been intended for an\ninscription that was never carved. The top edge of the panel is\n broken by a crude round window made some time alter 1920.\n\nThe anteroom within that doorway is roofed by two cross\nvaults separated by an east-west transverse arch. Two small\ncupboards open in the north wall, and an irregular high-level\nrecess has been cut into the south half of the east (Haram) wall.\nThe north half of the east wall is hidden by a modern partition.\nThere is no sign of any windows except for the modern\nopening above the entrance door. In the south wall of the\nanteroom a wide doorway (now blocked) is framed by a simple\nmoulding with volute finials at the bottom partly masked by\nmodern paving (plate 31.7). This doorway led into the tomb\nchamber.\n\nThe tomb chamber contains two cenotaphs. In the\nsouthern part is a small gabled cenotaph, now coated with\ncement, which presumably marks the grave of Oghul Khatin.\nTo the north is a grander cenotaph marking the recent grave of\nthe Hashemite Sharif, ‘Abd al-Hamid.\n\nThe chamber is almost square in plan with tall wall arches\nin each side to reduce the central area under the dome to an\nexact square. The north, west and south walls are constructed\nof red and cream-coloured ablagq, as are the wall arches. The\neast wall, which is the Haram wall, is plastered. Originally there\nwas in each of the three ablaq walls an opening spanned by a\nlintel and an ab/aq relieving arch: in the north wall the entrance\nfrom the anteroom; in the west wall a window to the courtyard;\nand in the south wall a door or window to the assembly hall. All\nthese openings are now blocked. In the east wall was a window\nopening on the Haram but this has been converted into a door,\nwhich is now the only entrance to the chamber. Above the\nablaq masonry an ogee moulding runs round three sides of the\nchamber at the springing level of the wall arches. Around the\nextrados of the four arches a splay-face moulding articulates the\nconjunction between the arches and the double-faceted\npendentives that make the transition from the square base to\nthe drum, which is eight-sided in the interior though the\nexterior is circular. Pointed-arched windows open in each side\nof the drum. The lower part of each of these windows is\nblocked by the surrounding roof, presumably when the roof\nwas resurfaced at some time. There are two more windows,\none opening in the tympanum of the west wall arch and the\nother in the corresponding position in the south wall arch.\n\nThe pendentives and the tympanums of the wall arches\noriginally bore a rich stucco decoration in relief That\ndecoration has now entirely disappeared, but the dilapidated\nremains visible in Creswell’s 1920 photograph (plate 31.8)\nsuffice to convey a reasonably accurate impression of the\n overall scheme. The two pendentives shown in this photograph\nare decorated alike with a swirling arabesque of interlacing\nleafy tendrils, and the whole composition is enclosed within a\nraised stucco border. The decoration of the tympanum is quite\ndifferent: a more formal composition framed by a fretted\nborder. Across the base of this border runs a frieze of\nintersecting semicircles with trifoliate terminals to the\nupturned points. There are two identical circular medallions\non either side of the window in the middle of the tympanum.\nThese contain a distinctive strapwork motif comprising a six-\npointed star interlaced with a six-lobed rosette (fig. 31.12) -a\ncommon design in Islamic art and architecture.” A photograph\nin the collection of the Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem” shows that\nall four wall arches and pendentives were decorated\nidentically, which suggests that a mould or a stencil was used.\n\nThe assembly hall to the south of the tomb chamber was\noriginally reached from the courtyard through the recessed\nentrance door described above. There was a second entrance,\nnow a window, from the Haram, and possibly a third from the\ntomb chamber (see above). The only entrance nowadays is the\nmodern door from the Haram at the south end of the east wall\nof the hall.\n\nThe floor of the hall has been raised about 0.40m. On it\nstand modern cenotaphs marking the graves of five notables\nburied here since 1930. The vaulting is in three bays with short\nbarrel vaults at the north and south ends and a folded cross\nvault in the centre, which rises to an octagonal cupola at the\ncrown (see fig. 31.6). The three bays are separated by ablaq\ntransverse arches. The south, west and north walls are built in\nablaq masonry to a height of 2.99m where an ogee moulding\nextends around the three walls. The whole of the east wall, that\nis the pre-existing Haram wall, is plastered, as are the upper\nparts of the other walls and the vaults. The two high-level\nwindows, opening on the courtyard and on the tomb chamber,\nhave screens of polychrome glass set in plaster tracery (plates\n31.9 and 31.10). Both screens may be later insertions.\n\nThe entrance door from the courtyard is flanked by two\nwindows; all are now blocked. The door is set in a shallow\nrecess spanned by a trefoil arch composed of ablaq voussoits\n(see plate 31.11), which may have been inspired by the nearby\nablaq trefoil arch at Bab al-Qattanin (above, p. 278). The\ntympanum of the upper lobe of the arch is decorated with a\nradial revetment similar to that of the exterior arch of the\ndoorway. The ogee moulding bends upwards here over the\nhead of the arch. The flanking windows are plain rectangular\nembrasures in the ablag masonry of the walls, as is the opening\n to the tomb chamber in the north wall. The soffit of the second\nmasonry course above the lintels of the windows is undercut as\nif to reduce the load on the lintels, while the lintel of the\nopening in the north wall is surmounted by an ablagq relieving\narch.\n\nThe mibrab in the middle of the south wall is somewhat\nsquat in appearance due to the raising of the floor level. It is set\nin an arched recess (see plate 31.11), the pointed horseshoe\narch of which has unsupported haunches, doubtless originally\nsustained by nook-shafts. The conch is of coursed ablaq, below\nwhich the curved interior of the niche is inlaid with five round-\nheaded vertical panels of red stone.\n Fig. 31.9 Cut-away axonometric view of buildings on south\nside of Tariq Bab al-Hadid as they may have appeared at the\nend of the fifteenth century\n TWO STAGES OF CONSTRUCTION?\n\nMujir al-Din records that the construction, first endowed in\n755/1354 by Oghul Khatiin, was completed and re-endowed in\n782/1380 by Isfahan Shah. The provision in the Arghiniyya of\nan entrance passageway to the Khatiniyya shows that the\nKhatiiniyya existed before the Arghiiniyya was constructed in\n759/1358. That earlier construction must surely have included\nthe main assembly hall/tomb chamber/anteroom complex\nbeside the Haram wall. What more did it include? Or, to put the\nquestion another way, what did Isfahan Shah’s ‘completion’\nentail? There would appear to be three possibilities: (1) the\nfinishing of minor details of no great architectural significance;\n(2) the addition of all or part of the two iwéins and cells that\nenclose the courtyard; or (3) the addition of an upper\nextension above the Haram portico.\n\nAbout the first possibility we can say little except that the\npresent building, despite later alterations and additions, has the\nappearance of a homogeneous whole.\n\nThe second possibility nevertheless deserves careful\nconsideration for there are certain irregularities in the design\nand construction of the two ivédns in particular. The north\niwan is barrel-vaulted and has a pointed frontal arch composed\nof twenty-nine voussoirs, whereas the south ivan is cross-\nvaulted and its frontal arch is slightly horseshoed and\ncomposed of only twenty-five smaller voussoirs. Moreover, the\nfrontal arch of the south iwén masks the vertical run of the\nquirked ogee moulding in the facade at the east end of the\n 4 MUJIL, 1, 50.\n\n3 CIA (Ville), 280, note 1.\n\n4 Weare grateful to Mr. NazmiJu‘beh of the Haram Museum for bringing this to\nOur attention and providing us with a copy of the full text.\n\n5 Defter no. 602, 456.\n\n6 If this means to the right when leaving the Haram, then a house somewhere\nbetween the Ribat Kurt and the Qalawan Hospice seems to be intended.\n\n7 Ipsirli, 46 and 184.\n\n8 AGP, 113.

The moulding returns above the coupled elbow\nbrackets supporting the east springer of that ivan in an\nawkward fashion as if the bracket were a later insertion. The\nbracket itself is the only one that is damaged, which might have\nhappened if it was lying around for some time before being\nused. Furthermore, the vault of the iwédn obscures part of the\ncontinuation of the moulding over the assembly hall window\n(see fig. 31.5). At the north iwén, on the other hand, the\nmoulding is obviously an integral part of both the facade and\nthe springer of the iwvédn’s frontal arch. We may conclude,\ntherefore, that the south iwdén is a later addition, perhaps part\nof Isfahan Shah’s ‘completion’. All the cells around the\ncourtyard, surmounted by a continuous cornice moulding\nsimilar to that on the facade of the complex beside the Haram\nwall, appear, however, to form part of the earlier construction.\nThis would explain why the long entrance passageway had to\nlead through one of the cells to give access to the courtyard.\n\nOf the third possibility — that Isafahan Shah added an\nextension over the Haram portico — all that can be said is that\nthere was indeed a structure above the portico but there are\nindications that it formed part of the Ribat al-Zamani (below, p.\n576) or the ‘Uthmaniyya (below, p. 550). If the latter were true\nit is conceivable that there might have been some confusion\nbetween the founder of the ‘Uthminiyya and the completer of\nthe Khatiniyya for both were called Isfahan Shah. That\nstructure above the portico was demolished in 1925.\n 23 There are two single elbow brackets in the window recesses on the Haram\nfacade of the Tankiziyya (above, p. 229). Van Berchem (CIA (Ville), 207 n.1) gives\na list of Crusader examples as well as referring to the remarkable ‘Islamic’\nexample at the ‘Ala’ al-Din Mosque (617/1220) in Konya. He also refutes de\nVogiié’s inexplicable contention that the device is Arab in origin (CIA (Ville), 207.\nn.2). RW. Hamilton, The Structural History of. the Aqsa Mosque, London, 1949, 45,\nsuggests that ‘the device may well have originated in the consoles carrying\ncolonnettes or arches which are to be seen in some north Syrian churches of the\nsixth century’.\n\n24 RW.

These buttresses and the adjacent seven bays\nof the portico were demolished and the portico was rebuilt\nafter the 1927 earthquake.*? The present appearance of the\nportico together with analysis of the variation in span between\nthe arches suggests that the rebuilding closely followed the\nlines of the original arrangement.\n\nHARAM FRONTAGE (fig. 32.6)\n\nThe original appearance of the frontage under the portico is\ndifficult to determine since the Haram wall has been recently\nrefaced. The present aspect of the openings is modern but they\nmust all be original. A doorway like the present one into the\nHaram from the south-east corner room would have provided\na bent entrance according with Mujir al-Din’s statement that the\nArghiniyya had direct access to the Haram.? The window\nopening into the east zwdan, shown as a blocked recess in van\nBerchem’s sketch plan made in 1914,° was presumably\nre-opened in 1931 when King Husayn I was buried in the east\niwan of the madrasa. Similarly the window into the tomb\nchamber, also shown as a recess in van Berchem’s sketch,\nwould have been re-opened then. Certainly it would be unusual\nif the tomb chamber beside the Haram gate did not have a\nwindow opening on the Haram as well as the one opening on\nthe street.*° Since al-Umari mentions no openings in this\nstretch of the Haram wall, these openings must have been\nintroduced with the construction of the Arghiiniyya.\n\nBAB AL-HADID (plate 32.1)\n\nMujir al-Din records that Bab al-Hadid was renewed\n(istajadda) by Arghiin al-Kamili and that it was once known as\nBab Arghiin.’’ Al-‘Umari, writing about ten years before Arghtin\narrived in Jerusalem, described an earlier gate ‘called Bab al-\nHadid . . . its height is 4% dbira‘ and its width 2%4 dhira’*®\nTaking al-‘Umari’s dhird‘ to measure 0.69m (above, p. 33 n. 11)\nhis measurements give a height of 3.10m and a width of 1.84m.\nThe present gate aperture measures 3.07m by 1.83m, so it\nwould appear that Arghiin’s renewal of the gate retained the\ndimensions of the original.\n STREET FACADE (fig. 32.5, plate 32.2)\n\nWith a tall entrance portal placed centrally between two large\nwindows, the disposition of the street facade would be quite\nsymmetrical were it not for a short westward extension to\nincorporate the entrance to the Khatiniyya. The lower part of\nthe facade is constructed in ablaq of red and cream-coloured\nstone. As is customary, the ablaq masonry is bounded by a\nquirked ogee moulding (fig. 32.5), which rises in a high pish-\ntaq over the main entrance. At the west end of the facade the\nmoulding makes a curious return emphatically to exclude the\nKhatiiniyya entrance from the ablaq construction — in this way\nthe Khatiiniyya entrance is visually separated from the\nArghiniyya although structurally the two are integrated.\n\nIn addition to the two large windows there are two\ninsignificant openings in the ablaq masonry, one above the\nKhattniyya entrance and one above the large western window.\nAt roughly the same level a strainer arch of more recent\nconstruction, almost certainly Ottoman, spans the street to\nbuttress the facade (see above, p. 147). The upper part of the\nfacade above the moulding is of plain limestone.\n\nTwo steps, semicircular in plan, lead up to the entrance\ndoor set in a pointed-arched recess spanned by a cloister vault\n(plate 32.3). As usual, stone benches flank the doorway. Above\n the benches the stonework of both outer corners of the recess\nis rounded off in the form of diminutive engaged columns\n2.20m high with vase capitals and bases. The door opening\nitself is trimmed with a delicate moulding (fig. 32.4) which,\nmost unusually, does not circumscribe the ablag masonry but\n is carved across it.*? Above this moulding the dating inscription\nextends across the width of the recess (plate 32.4). The two\nblazons contained within the inscription have been published\nrepeatedly. L.A. Mayer describes the blazon as a ‘napkin on the\nmiddle field of a three-fielded shield’, the badge of the jamdar,\nmaster of the robes.“° Traces of red paint survive in the middle\nfield of both shields. The colours of Arghiin’s blazon — gold\nrhomb in centre of red middle field, top and bottom fields\nwhite — are known from a glazed pottery shard in the Citadel\nMuseum in Aleppo. In the centre of each side wall of the recess,\nat the same height as the inscription on the rear wall, faint traces\nof pencil and plaster mark two circles. These may originally\nhave been decorated with blazons. Immediately above the\nlintel is a revetment of three inlaid marble slabs with\ninterlocking trefoils to represent the joggled voussoirs of a flat\nrelieving arch, slightly undercut over the middle of the lintel.\nThis in turn is surmounted by a course of ablag joggling which\nextends around the portal recess and across the facade. A plain\nrectangular window pierces the rear wall of the recess above\nthe door to admit daylight to a small room (marked ‘E’ on the\nupper floor plan, fig. 32.4) above the vestibule-iwén.\n\nThe two large windows in the facade are decorated like the\ndoorway with mouldings around the openings and marble\nlintels (part of a continuous course of marble). The course\nabove is here enlivened by an inlaid marble slab with\ninterlocking trefoils (plate 32.2). Above this the course of\njoggling is very slightly arcuated as if to relieve the load in the\nlintels. The eastern window, belonging to the tomb chamber,\nretains its original iron grille, while at the western window the\nsill has been lowered to form a doorway into the small room\nthere (which, incidentally, houses a sweet shop).\n\nThe frontage of the Khatiniyya entrance (fig. 32.5)\nconsists of a simple pointed-arched opening built exclusively\nin cream-coloured limestone. As if further to segregate this\nentrance from the main construction, a shallow muqarnas\nfrieze supervenes on the returning quirked ogee moulding just\nabove and to the left of the opening (fig. 32.5). The jambs are\nlightly chamfered up to the height of the springing of the arch.\nThere is a similar though deeper chamfer apparently intended\nto prevent detrition of the north-western corner of the\nbuilding; it was rendered obsolete by the contiguous\nconstruction of the Muzhiriyya (no. 62).\n\nThe entrance leads into a long groin-vaulted passage. In\nfive narrow recesses in the west wall and one in the east wall of\nthis passage remnants of earthenware pipes are still\ndiscernible. These pipes were presumably intended to channel\nrainwater from the roof into the underground cistern whose\n well-head is to be found next to the staircase (below, p. 363). A\nblocked opening or recess (marked ‘a’ on the plan, fig. 32.3) in\nthe west wall of the passage has a very low head only 1.20m\nabove the floor. The original purpose of this opening is not\nknown.\n\nSeveral features of the facade such as the high pish-tdq of\nthe portal, the extensive use of ablaq, the continuous band of\njoggling and the muqarnas frieze at the Khatiniyya entrance\nrecall the distinctive architectural style of Mamlak tombs at\nDamascus in the quarter known as al-Maydan,\"! and it would\nappear therefore that Arghiin, a former governor of Damascus,\nhad employed craftsmen from this provincial capital to design\nand build his funerary monument in Jerusalem.\n\nMADRASA (plan, fig. 32.3)\n\nThe straight access through the vestibule from the street into\nthe courtyard is another typically Syrian feature. The courtyard,\nsquare in plan, is roofed with a folded cross vault rising toa\nlarge octagonal recess at the crown (plate 32.6). Without doubt\nthis recess originally opened into a lantern dome (one of the\ntwo domes mentioned in the list of projected repairs drawn up\n in 979/1571-72, see p. 358 above) to light and ventilate the\ncourtyard. A similar lantern dome, though smaller in relation to\nthe vaulted surface, survives at the Almalikiyya (above, p. 314,\nJig. 26.7). The dome was removed and the oculus blocked some\ntime before 1914 (when van Berchem photographed the\ninterior), presumably when the floor above was taken over for\na dwelling.\n\nThe vault over the courtyard is supported by the frontal\narches of the cross-vaulted zwdans on the east, south and west\nsides, and a fourth identical though blind arch on the north side\nenclosing the much smaller segmental-arched opening of the\nvestibule-zvdn, which is decorated with a double quirked ogee\nmoulding (fig. 32.11). A small window (now blocked) in the\ntympanum of that blind arch formerly opened into a room over\nthe vestibule-iwdan. Van Berchem’s photographs (C/A\n(Planches), \\xix upper and lower) show that the walls of the\niwans were built of ashlar masonry. The vaults, built of rubble\nmasonry, are plastered as usual.\n\nA slightly corbelled string course runs around the iwans\njust below the springing of the arches. This string course is\ndecorated with a repeating shallow mugarnas element similar\n to that on the facade at the Khatiiniyya entrance. At the north\nside the string course is bent up over the apex of the pointed\nsegmental arch of the vestibule-ivdan (fig. 32.11). Today the\nwalls are lined with blockboard up to the height of the string\ncourse (plate 32.5). Above the string course the walls and vaults\nare plastered; only the voussoirs of the arches are exposed.\n The mibrab in the rear (gibla) wall of the south iwan,\nsemicircular in plan, has a stilted pointed arch (plate 32.7).\nCreswell’s photograph (plate 32.8) shows how it looked in\n1920, with ill-fitting unmatched nook-shafts evidence of some\nrough-and-ready repair. It was refurbished in 1931 when a new\ncapital was made for the left-hand shaft. (The original capital,\nundiscovered by the refurbishers, was found by us in the room\nover the vestibule-iwdn: see plate 32.9.) The lowest masonry\ncourse of the gibla wall is plain limestone but above that, up to\nthe level of the springing of the mibrab arch, the wall is faced\nwith upright oblong panels of polychrome marble. Above the\nmarble panelling the wall is built in ablagq masonry up to the\nmuqarnas string course. The mibrab is framed by a rectangular\nquirked ogee moulding which, like the moulding on the\nfacade, is carved across the ablaq masonry. The upper part of\nthe qibla wall was open when van Berchem visited but, as he\nsurmised, that opening was probably made when the lantern\ndome was removed. There is now above the mihrab a\nrectangular window of coloured glass set in carved stucco.\n\nTwo tall brass candlesticks now flank the mihrdab (plate\n32.7). They both have inscriptions around their necks\nrecording that they were made for the Ottoman Sultan ‘Abd al-\nHamid II in 1306/1888-89 for the Aqsa Mosque. Many of the\ncarpets on the floor bear tags dated 1378/1958-59.\n\nThe other zwdns are decorated slightly differently in each\ncase. The west iwdn has in the centre of its south wall a\nrecessed doorway to the south-west corner room, which has\nbeen blocked up. Shallow recesses of a similar size occupy the\ncentre of the west and north walls of the ivéd. There are three\n openings in the corresponding positions in the east iwén: the\none in the north wall communicates with the tomb chamber;\nthat in the east wall is a window to the Haram and that in the\nsouth wall a doorway leading into the south-east corner room.\nA large cenotaph in this east zwén marks the grave of King\nHusayn I. It is covered by a gabled timber frame supporting a\nbeautiful gold-embroidered green brocade (kiswa) made in\n1366/1946-47 by ‘Uthman ‘Abd al-Hamid the embroiderer (al-\nqasabaji) in Khan al-Khalili in Cairo.\n The east zwdn (4.29m deep) is somewhat deeper than\neither the south #véin (3.82m deep) or the west zwan (3.81m\ndeep). Normally the south zwan would be the deepest (cf. the\nTankiziyya, above, p. 232). Van Berchem has surmised that the\nreason for this anomaly was ‘the configuration of the site that\nthe architect had to deal with, and which led him to sacrifice\nthis detail for the sake of the overall effect’. Our survey reveals\nthe more specific reason. By comparing the plan (fig. 32.3) with\nthe street elevation (fig. 32.5) it can be seen that the extra depth\nof the east iwdén is an unavoidable concomitant of the\nsymmetrical facade. The pre-existing Haram wall serves as the\nrear wall of the east iwdn whereas the rear wall of the west\niwan had to be built entirely anew. The position of this rear\nwall of the west ivdn was restricted by the obligation to\nprovide a passage to meet the cell on the north side of the\ncourtyard to the Khatiiniyya. Turning to the facade, which is\nsymmetrical about the entrance portal, we see that at the east\nend the vertical moulding abuts on the Haram wall, i.e. in line\nwith the rear wall of the east zd. But at the west end of the\nfagade proper (excluding the extension for the Khatiniyya\n entrance) the moulding is not in line with the rear wall of the\nwest zwdn, being 0.48m to the west of it. Since the courtyard is\nalso centred on the entrance portal, it follows that the west\nzwan is 0.48m shallower than the east zwan.\n\nAs for the south zwan, since the north-south depth of the\nsite was restricted by the street to the north and the Khatiniyya\nto the south, there was insufficient space to develop a\nconventional four-iwvdn layout and at the same time have a\nsymmetrical facade. If the entrance portal had occupied a\ncorner then there would have been room for matching north\nand south ivdans. But the designer opted for the symmetrical\nfacade with the entrance taking up the space which might\notherwise have accommodated a north ivén. Consequently\nthe north and south zwédms were reduced to the minimum, the\nsouth zvdn matching the depth of the west zwdn and the north\n‘vestibule-iwvan’ occupying the remaining space between the\ncourtyard and the entrance doorway.\n\nThe north-west corner of the madrasa houses a small\nbarrel-vaulted room with a window (now a door) opening on\nthe street, the staircase to the upper floor, and a trefoil-headed\nwell-niche (section, fig. 32.10). A shaft above the well allows\nwater to be drawn to the upper floor. Opposite the well-niche\nis a recess under the staircase.\n\nTOMB CHAMBER\n\nIn the north-east corner of the complex the tomb chamber has\n—as noted above — one window opening on the street beside\nthe Haram gate, one on the Haram and another in the south\nwall communicating with the east ivan. It is entered through a\ndoor in its west wall, opening from the vestibule-ivan (plate\n32.10). An anepigraphic cenotaph in the middle of the floor\nmarks the founder’s grave. Next to the cenotaph a stone trap\ndoor (plate 32.11) gives access to five steps leading down to the\nburial vault (see sections, figs. 32.8 and 32.10). The present\noccupants of the upper floors of the building say that a second\nburial vault beside this one contains the remains of the\nfounder’s wife and family. There is a second trap door (see\nplan, fig. 32.3) but we did not open it. The texts make no\nmention of a second grave.\n\nThe cross-vaulted ceiling of the tomb chamber is a later\ninsertion. Originally the chamber, square in plan, was domed\n(with the second of the two domes mentioned in the 979/1571-\n72 list of projected repairs, see p. 358 above). The axonometric\nreconstruction (fig. 31.9) shows the relationship between the\ntwo domes. The dome must have been replaced by a cross vault\nto allow the construction of the present room over the chamber\nsome time after 979/1571-72 (sections, figs. 32.8 and 32.10).\n UPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 32.4)\nA door in the west wall of the entrance vestibule opened at the\nfoot of the staircase to the upper floor. The pitch of the stairs has\nbeen reduced somewhat by the addition of new treads for the\nlower steps and the addition of two new steps at the bottom,\nobstructing the swing of the original door, which has been\nremoved. Originally the lowest step was in line with a 0.36m\nsouthward return in the south wall of the staircase (see ground\nfloor plan, fig. 32.3).\n\nThe staircase leads up to a corridor (plate 32.12) that runs\nsouth above the Khatiniyya passageway, past a stairway to the\nroof, to give access to a long room (A) roofed by three cross\n vaults (plate 32.13). A door in the east wall of that room opens\ninto across-vaulted room (B) over the (blocked) south-western\ncorner room of the madrasa, which has two windows (now\nblocked), one opening into the south ivan and the other into\nthe west iwdn. A later high-level window has been opened in\nthe south wall.\n\nAt the north end of the corridor there is a cross-vaulted\nchamber (C), now a latrine, with a small window overlooking\nthe street. Three steps lead east from this end of the corridor\nup to an L-shaped landing (plate 32.14) from which two rooms\nare entered: a vaulted room (D) which also has a window\noverlooking the street, and the cross-vaulted room (E) over the\n vestibule-iwvan. The latter room has a window opening in the\nrear wall of the portal and another (now blocked) into the\ncourtyard of the madrasa to the south. A recess in the north wall\nof the landing originally housed a shaft to allow water to be\ndrawn up from the well-head below.\n\nThese upper floor rooms may have been intended to serve\nas Arghiin’s temporary living quarters during his enforced\nretirement in Jerusalem. Since he died before completion of\nthe building they would never have served as such, however,\nand must have been used to accommodate the madrasa’s\nofficials.\n\nThe staircase on the west side of the upper floor corridor\nrises to the roof, which was originally unbuilt upon. Several\nrooms of Ottoman and later construction now occupy the roof\n(plan, fig. 62.5; plate 32.15).\n Notes\n\n1 CIA (Ville), no. 85.\n\n2 Op. cit., 283-4.\n\n3 Mujir, ii, 36-7.\n\n4 Bab al-Hadid means ‘the Iron Gate’.

It will\nhave been noticed that the inscription gives the date of death as 28 Shawwal,\nwhereas Mujir al-Din (Mujir, ii, 37) says Thursday, 26 Shawwal/Thursday, 12\nOctober 1357. Other sources agree on the ‘Thursday’. The inscription date would\ncorrespond to Saturday, 14 October. One would expect the inscription to be\ncorrect. Ibn Khatib al-Nasiriyya gives the death date as Thursday, 11 Dhi\'l-Hijja\n758/Thursday, 23 November 1357, but confirms that Arghiin ‘was buried in the\nturba he had built for himself there’ (Ibn Khatib al-Nasiriyya, fol. 133b).\n16 Khitat, ii, 73.\n17 CIA (Alep), no. 180; see also two fifteenth-century inscriptions, op. cit., nos.\n182-3, and Ahmad ‘Isa Beg, Ta’rikh al-Bimdristandt etc., Damascus, 1939, 252-8.\n18 Van Berchem quotes Ibn Qadi Shuhba to this effect, see CIA (Ville), 283, n.3.\n19 Sijill 85, 264, quoted by Asali, Ma Ghid, 190.\n20 Sijill 10, no. 1458.\n21 Mujir, ii, 221.\n22 Asali, Ma Ghid, 191, considers Ibn al-Naqib a regular mudarris.\n23 Mujfr, ii, 311. This passage has been misunderstood to mean that the governor\nin 879/1475 resided in the Arghtiniyya, as in the case of Khidr Beg which follows,\nbut it can hardly be understood otherwise than to mean that the shaykb took up\nresidence in the madrasa. The printed edition specifies the date of his arrival as\nSha‘ban/8 February-8 March, whereas it had been said before that the new\ngovernor only arrived Thursday, 15 Dhii’l-Qa‘da/Thursday, 23 March. This leaves\nthe case of Khidr Beg an isolated one. Cf.

That an earlier gate existed may be inferred also from\nthe position of the Ribat of Kurt al-Mansiri (above, p. 144) built in 693/1293-94,\nwhich was reached from the Haram through Bab al-Hadid. As van Berchem\nsuggests (CIA (Ville), 283) Arghiin’s work at Bab al-Hadid was probably\ncontemporaneous with the construction of the madrasa.\n\n39 Analogous examples of a moulding around the doorway and the rounding-off\nof the corners of the recess are to be found at the Maristan of Arghiin in Aleppo,\nbuilt four years earlier in 755/1354 and otherwise quite dissimilar from his\nmadrasa in Jerusalem. The Aleppo maristin appears to have been built by local\ncraftsmen (C/A (Alep), 332-38) while the madrasa in Jerusalem was probably built\nby craftsmen from Damascus.\n\n40 L.A. Mayer, Saracenic Heraldry, Oxford, 1933, 74.\n\n41 Eg. the Araqiyya Turba dated 750/1349 (a very brief description in J. Sauvaget,\nLes monuments historiques de Damas, Beirut, 1932, 70); cf. K. Wulzinger and C.\nWatzinger, Damaskus: die islamische Stadt, Berlin and Leipzig, 1924, pls. 20b, 21a,\n21b. In the caption to pl. 22c Wulzinger and Watzinger draw attention to what is\nan unusual feature amongst the buildings in this quarter: an ‘asymmetrische\nFassade’. It would be interesting to compare the layout of the Arghiiniyya with that\nof the Mamlik funerary madrasas at al-Maydan in Damascus but no survey of these\nmonuments has been published.\n\n42 CIA (Ville), 279.\n ','HARAM FRONTAGE, MADRASA, TOMB CHAMBER'),(33,'HARAM FAGADE (fig. 33.6)\nThe facade on to the Haram has the appearance of having been\nerected in several phases. The eastern bay of the supporting\nportico and the entrance staircase were built initially as part of\nthe substructure of the Almalikiyya. The portico and the\nassembly hall supported by it were built against that staircase,\nand the eastern domed chamber built over it. Later on, the\nwesternmost bay of the portico and the domed chamber above\nwere added after the completion of the assembly hall as their\nstructural discontinuity indicates: the westernmost bay breaks\nbond with the assembly hall and its supporting portico.\nAl-“Umari mentions only the three piers supporting the\n two bays of portico under the assembly hall beyond which he\nsays there is only an open space. We may deduce therefore that\nthe main part of the Is‘ardiyya was built after 741/1340 (the date\nof construction of the adjoining Almalikiyya) but before 743/\n1342-43 when this part of al-‘Umari’s text was written, and that\nthe western domed chamber was added some time after 743/\n1342.\n\nThese phases of construction would seem, however, to\nhave followed in close succession as part of a deliberate plan to\nemulate the facade of the Almalikiyya. In both cases the\nassembly hall is contained between projecting buttresses rising\nthe full height of the facade. The western buttress of the\nAlmalikiyya defines the eastern limit of the Is‘ardiyya facade.\nThis was subsequently matched by a similar buttress\ndetermining the western limit.\n\nThe tripartite facade indicates the layout of rooms behind.\nThe long assembly hall between the intermediate buttresses is\nsupported by two cross-vaulted bays of the portico. At each end\nare the domed chambers. The westernmost is supported by a\nsingle cross-vaulted bay and the easternmost by the pre-\nexisting bay of the Almalikiyya portico supplemented by the\nnarrow rising vault over the entrance staircase. A simple cavetto\nmoulding running across the central compartment between\nthe intermediate buttresses distinguishes the upper facade (of\nthe assembly hall) from the portico below.\n\nA stone pier abutting’? on the westernmost buttresses\nappears to be all that remains of a portico built later to provide\naccess to the Subaybiyya (no. 51). This westward continuation\nof the portico is alluded to by Mujir al-Din who states that the\nporticoes under the Almalikiyya, the Is‘ardiyya and the\nSubaybiyya were built at the same time as the madrasas above.’®\n\nAregular series of about a dozen empty sockets shaped to\nreceive the springers of a vaulted portico survives cut into the\nface of the escarpment of Antonia (above, p. 44) at a height of\napproximately 2.60m above the Haram esplanade. The average\nspan between the centres of the sockets is 3.89m. These sockets\ncertainly antecede the Mamlik portico which sustains the\nIs‘ardiyya and the Almalikiyya, for they continue empty and\nredundant in the rock face under these two buildings.\n\nIn describing the upper facade we shall treat each section\nin the likely sequence of construction: assembly hall, eastern\ndomed chamber and western domed chamber. The 1927-28\nrestoration has introduced several changes at this level and\nthese will be itemized briefly, but it is the pre-restoration aspect\nof the facade (plate 33.1) which merits detailed description.\n(@) Assembly hall\nThe cantilevered mibradb salient — a unique form in the\narchitecture of Jerusalem — is the dominant feature of the\nfacade (plate 33.8). It is semicircular in plan, capped by a\nribbed semidome and resting on muqarnas corbelling.\n\nThe facade of the assembly hall is arranged symmetrically\nabout the miprab with four rectangular windows, two on each\nside of the mibrab, set in shallow, muqarnas-headed recesses\nwith sloping sills. The two windows and their recesses adjacent\nto the mibrab are considerably wider and taller than two lateral\nwindows and recesses. Originally the larger windows had\nshallow relieving arches with joggled ablag voussoirs to\nreduce the load on the lintels, while the load on the lintels of\nthe lateral windows was lessened by two relieving lintels with\nundercut soffits. These original lintels have been replaced with\nflat arches composed of ablaq voussoirs.\n\nThe curvilinear mugarnas corbelling of the window\nrecesses is original. The design of the corbelling is basically the\nsame in each case, but the slight extra depth of the two larger\nrecesses has permitted a more complete development of the\ndesign to include pendent elements (‘stalactites’). At the lateral\nrecesses the base of the corbelling rests on moulded shoulders\n(fig. 33.8) which reduce the effective span. This seems to\nindicate that in the design of the muqarnas system a pattern\nwas used which did not quite match the width of the recess and\ntherefore necessitated the introduction of shoulders to adjust\nthe span to suit.\n Three oculi in the upper part of the wall ventilate the\nassembly hall. The central oculus above the mihrdb is at a\nsomewhat higher level than the oculi over the lateral window\nrecesses and is encircled by ten radial ablaq voussoirs of\nalternately red and cream-coloured stone. The oculi over the\nlateral recesses are alike, encircled by six radial voussoirs of\nplain cream-coloured limestone.\n\nOriginally a moulded cornice ran straight across the top of\nthe facade and onto the intermediate buttresses. The\nrectangular pish-tdgq-like pediment above the central oculus\nand the water spouts in the intermediate buttresses were added\nduring the 1927-28 restoration, as was the central dome, which\nis much larger than the original small dome it encloses (cf.\nplates 33.1 and 33.9).\n rial€ oo.! Maram tagaae berore restoration\n\n(ti) Eastern domed chamber\n\nThe facade of this chamber was reconstructed during the\nrestoration and very little of the original remains. The\nphotograph taken by Creswell (plate 33.1) shows the original\nMamluk design, which consisted essentially of a double-arched\nwindow surmounted by a central oculus and crowned by a\nmuqarnas canopy. The voussoirs of the window arches and of\nthe outer ring of the oculus were ablaq (presumably of red and\ncream-coloured stone) as were the courses of masonry above\nthe arches. The inner ring of voussoirs around the oculus was\nof plain limestone.\n\nOriginally the pointed arches of the double window\nspanned from a central marble column with a Mamlik capital\nand base (barely discernible in the pre-restoration\nphotograph) and lateral jambs of ashlar masonry. The left-hand\n(western) jamb abutted on the buttress to the west in such a way\nas to indicate that it was built later than that buttress. The\nmasonry courses of the right-hand (eastern) jamb are\n continuous and contemporaneous with the masonry of a\nnarrow buttress built hard against the western end of the\nAlmalikiyya. That buttress, carried by a simple rounded\nconsole, was added at this eastern end of the upper facade to\nsupport the muqarnas canopy which spans the recess.\n\nAlmost all of these details were altered in the\nreconstruction. The double arch of the window now rests on\nthree columns with new capitals and bases. The design of the\nfacade above the window has been fundamentally altered to\nreproduce that of the western domed chamber (described\nbelow).\n\nThe mugqarnas canopy, of which almost half survived in\n1914,” has been restored to its original form. The height of this\ncompartment of the facade is higher than the facade of the\nassembly hall and matches that of the adjoining Almalikiyya.\nThe earlier low dome of the room behind, which is visible in\nthe photograph of Creswell, has been replaced by a much\nlarger and bulbous one on an octagonal drum duplicating the\nlikewise new dome of the assembly hall.\n\n(iii) Western domed chamber\n\nThis echoes in its layout the original facade of the eastern\ndomed chamber, though the architectural details are more\nelaborate. It was scarcely altered in the restoration. The pointed\narches of the double window rested on three re-used columns\nwith torus bases and stylized thick-leaf acanthus capitals of\nundoubted Crusader manufacture. These Crusader capitals and\nbases have been replaced with modern ‘Islamic’ muqarnas\ncapitals and bulbous bases; the column shafts may be\nreplacements as well. (The present whereabouts of the\nCrusader capitals is unknown.) A stone shelf which projected\nfrom the middle of the window sill (see plate 33.1) was\nremoved in the restoration.\n\nAs in the corresponding eastern compartment, the\nvoussoirs of the pointed window arches are ablagq, as is the\npanel of ornament above, but here the extrados of the arches is\noutlined by a moulding, which is identical in profile to the\nmouldings which frame lintels of the Almalikiyya (fig. 10f) and\nthe double window arches of the Manjakiyya (no. 35). This\nmoulding extends upwards to frame the panel of ornament\ncomprising, in the central spandrel, a circular medallion of\nablag radial voussoirs around an inlaid disk, and, in each of the\nside spandrels, a semicircular medallion of ablaq radial\nvoussoirs around a semicircular inlay. The moulding\nsurrounds the medallions and connects with the upper\ntransverse band through circular links in a fashion which\nrecalls the analogous feature on the facade of the Almalikiyya.\n\nThe three-tiered mugarnas canopy, unaltered in the\nrestoration, is fussy and more intricate than the canopy over the\neastern compartment of the facade, and also rises above the\nheight of the assembly hall. The slightly pointed dome seems to\nbe original; it sits on an octagonal drum. Originally the dome\n was probably cement-faced; the present stone cladding —\nmerely repointed in the restoration — appears to be Ottoman.\n\nINTERIOR (plan, fig. 33.4)\n\n(i) Entrance\n\nThe staircase leads up to an entrance door which is not original,\nas Creswell’s photograph of the interior (plate 33.6) shows.\nThe present door takes the place of a flat niche decorated in\nablag with a pointed arch inlay in the form of a mibrab. The\nlocation of the original entrance is not shown in Creswell’s\nphotograph nor is any trace of a blocked doorway discernible\nnow. But there are two clues which allow its position to be\nestablished with a measure of certainty.\n\nWe know from al-‘Umar’’s text (p. 368 above) that the steps\nleading up to the Almalikiyya also gave access to the Is‘ardiyya.\nInside, in the south wall of the tunnel-vaulted inner porch, the\npresent entrance door and the door leading into the assembly\nhall occupy a shallow recess spanned by a continuous frieze of\nmuqarnas corbelling, which returns 1.65m northwards over a\nplastered recess in the east wall of the porch but, significantly,\ndoes not return along the west wall. The design is asymmetrical\nand the reason is obvious: the recess in the east wall initially\nhoused the entrance doorway. Indeed, the two large fluted\nniches in the upper register of the muqarnas frieze at the south\nwall are directly above the door into the assembly hall and the\nformer mibrab’ while, in the east wall, a corresponding fluted\n\nniche in the upper register surely marks the centre-line of the\noriginal entrance doorway below.\n Se Re eR ee | ee ee ee eS Ne es NN teat ern rai,\n\nthe mibrab dismantled, a new straight-through entrance\ndoorway introduced,\'* and the muqarnas corbelling above it\nrecut (plate 33.10). In the south wall of the porch, above the\nmuqarnas corbelling, is a rectangular limestone panel framed\nby a band of red and cream-coloured stone. This panel,\noriginally uninscribed, now bears the restoration inscription\n(above, p. 370).\n\n(ti) Assembly hall (plate 33.5)\n\nThe right-hand door in the rear wall of the inner porch is the\nsole entrance to the assembly hall overlooking the Haram. The\ninterior of the hall is vaulted in three bays separated by two\ntransverse arches resting on muqarnas imposts. The three\noculi in the south wall are positioned immediately under the\napexes of the vaults for maximum heat ventilation. The end\nbays have plain cross vaults while the wider central bay has a\nfolded cross vault rising to an ornate cupola at the crown (plate\n33.11). The octagonal base of the cupola is decorated with three\ntiers of muqarnas supporting a ring of sixteen stalactites.\n\nThe south wall of the centre bay is unplastered, showing\nthe ablaq construction. The mibrab, semicircular in plan, is\nplaced in the centre of that wall within a shallow muqarnas-\nheaded recess (fig. 33.7, plate 33.12). The remaining walls and\nthe vaults are plastered. The main surfaces of the pre-\nrestoration plaster were defined by a small semicircular\n\nmoulding or baguette (visible in plate 33.5.) which was restored\nin 1927-28.\n (iii) Eastern domed chamber\n\nA simple rectangular doorway in the east wall of the assembly\nhall leads directly into the eastern domed chamber. Here the\ndome rests on a circular drum and double-faceted pendentives\n(plate 33.13). The dome was rebuilt, at least externally, in the\n1927-28 restorations (see above, p. 371).\n\n(iv) Western domed chamber\n\nA plain doorway in the west wall of the assembly hall opens into\nthe western domed chamber. This chamber has in addition to\nthe double window overlooking the Haram to the south\n(described above, p. 371) a small rectangular window in its\nwest wall. Two arches at the north wall and one against the west\nwall reduce the rectangular area to create a square basis for the\ndome. Three-tiered muqarnas pendentives support the\noctagonal drum, which has a double-arched squinch in each\ncorner and a double-arched flat niche in each of its four sides\n(plate 33.14). The drum and the dome are plastered. The\nmugqarnas pendentives appear to match the consistent style of\nthe muqarnas decoration found throughout the building and\n\n{SE Pe Se oy tay TORE: hee y MET ter a —e\n\n this stylistic continuity implies a close chronological\ncorrespondence between the western domed chamber and the\nrest of the construction.\n\n(v) Tomb\n\nThe inner porch opens directly on a tunnel-vaulted gibla iwan\n(plate 33.6) at the south end of the open courtyard. A cross-\nvaulted recess in the west wall of the zvdan houses an unmarked\ncenotaph. The importance of this tomb recess is stressed by the\nspecial decoration of its entrance (plate 33.4): a pointed\nhorseshoe arch composed of black and white ablaq voussoirs\nspringing from two re-used marble columns with unmatched\nCrusader capitals (plates 33.16 and 33.17).\n\nThe lower part of the south wall of the recess, distinct from\nthe other walls, is unplastered and the masonry, to judge from\nits size and tooling, is Herodian and i situ up to a height of\nabout two metres (plate 33.18). The stepped plan of the\nupper masonry shows that here as elsewhere the Herodian wall\nwas articulated in a series of pilasters.”\n\nThe plain. marble-clad cenotanh ( pigte 33.19) is raised on\n a low marble plinth with a moulded base placed centrally\nwithin the recess and oriented as usual east—west.\n\nThe opening under the arch of the tomb recess is screened\nby a beautifully-made iron grille with a small grilled wicket gate\nof two leaves in the centre. The original trefoil cresting and\nKoranic inscription have become detached from the the grille,\nthough a short length visible #7 situ in 1920 (plate 33.4) still\nsurvives (plate 33.20). Mamlik ironwork of this quality is\nextremely rare and the grille deserves specialist study,\nparticularly since it is inscribed with what seems to be the\n‘signature’ of the craftsman who produced it:\n\nMuhammad b. al-Zayn, the servant of the humble servant\nof the one in need of Allah, who hopes for the pardon of\nhis Lord, His Excellency (al-magarr)...\n\nThis inscription is incised on an iron strip (plate 33.21)\noriginally attached to the lintel bar on the wicket gate so that the\ncurved, downward projection would have been in the centre\nwhere the two gate leaves meet. The strip is broken just beyond\nthe mid-point and the continuation of the inscription is lost.\nThe gate leaves themselves are marked at the corners with\ncurious symbols (plate 33.22), one on the vertical member\nmatching another on the adjoining horizontal member,\napparently intended to facilitate assembly of the gates on the\n site, away from their place of manufacture.\n(vi) Courtyard (plate 33.2)\nThe irregular internal arrangement of cells around the\ncourtyard, evident in the plan (fig. 33.4), is not expressed\nexternally. The pointed-arched doors and windows are set out\nquite regularly; only the elaboration of the well-niche (plate\n33.3) in the west wall interrupts the rhythm of the scheme.\nThe door of the middle cell in the east wall, opposite the\nwell-niche, has recently been converted into a window when,\nby the removal of an internal partition wall, that cell was united\nwith the adjoining south-eastern cell. The two pointed-arched\ndoorways at the eastern and western ends of the north wall\n(plate 33.2) are set in shallow recesses each decorated with\nthree tiers of curvilinear muqarnas corbelling . The jambs of\nthe recesses are straight but the heads are chamfered, as are the\npointed arches of all the doors and windows around the\ncourtyard. The western door in the north wall has been\nconverted to a window and the internal arrangement of the cell\nit served has been altered. A partition between it and the\nadjoining cell to the east has been removed and a door in its\nwest wall is blocked (see plan). The small room that that\nblocked door originally gave access to has instead been linked,\nby the removal of its south wall, to the northern cell in the west\nwall of the courtyard.\n With the exception of the two doorways at either end of\nthe north wall, the doors and windows around the courtyard at\nthis level are each surmounted by an eight-lobed oculus (plates\n33.2 and 33.23). The upper walls on the west, north and east\nsides of the courtyard project slightly, corbelled on a bed\nmoulding decorated with a repeating shallow muqarnas\nelement (see plate 33.23). Acyma recta cornice moulding runs\naround all four sides of the courtyard.\n\n(vit) Well-niche\n\nThe elaborate decoration of the well-niche is illustrated in plate\n33.3. The chamfered trefoil which outlines the outer bay of\nmuqarnas vaulting is set within a recessed pointed arch. The\narch has two orders of decoration, the outer one an\ninterlocking trefoil pattern in relief such as occurs commonly at\nDamascus,” and the inner one a chevron moulding which\nreflects a local Crusader influence.” The impression created by\nthe composition is one of considerable imagination, as if the\nmason in charge were practising his repertoire with\nenthusiasm, and the muddling of the mouldings at the keystone\nof the chevron arch shows that the work was to some extent\nexperimental.\n\nThe deep niche is vaulted in two bays which are separated\nby a simple pointed arch (plate 33.24). The outer bay with its\n elaborate muqarnas vaulting contrasts with the simpler cross\nvault of the inner bay, which is over the well-head. A chimney-\nlike orifice at the crown of the inner vault allowed water to be\ndrawn from the cistern to the cells above.\n\n(viti) Staircase\n\nThe special decoration of the doorway at the eastern end of the\nnorth wall of the courtyard (described above) could be\nexpected since that led to the upper floor. The similar\ndecoration of the door at the western end was probably\nintended for symmetry. The eastern doorway opens into a\npassage leading to a spiral staircase which rises under a well-\nbuilt ashlar vault to the upper floor (plate 33.25).\n\n(ix) Upper floor (fig. 33.5)\n\nAt the top of the stairs the vaulting has been dismantled (plate\n33.26); one now emerges in the open air beside a passage\nconnecting with two cells on the east side of the courtyard. The\ndoor into the southern one has been walled up and the cell\nannexed to the Almalikiyya (above, p. 316). The northern cell is\nentered by a door in its south wall (the breach in its east wall is\nmodern). No other rooms survive at this level but the\ndisposition of the windows around the courtyard gives some\nidea of the original layout. At the south side the ivén rises to\nthe full height of the two storeys. In each of the north, west and\neast walls are three square windows with muqarnas-headed\nslit windows above. To reduce the direct load on the lintels of\nthe square windows, the course of masonry immediately above\neach is undercut to a cusped profile. Evidently there were three\ncells entered from the north at the north end of the courtyard,\nand possibly two cells on the west side arranged like those on\nthe east side with an access corridor. The cells at the north side\nwere ruined before 1920 and the breach in the north wall,\nshown in plate 33.2, was repaired presumably during the 1927-\n28 restoration. The cells on the west side were demolished to\nmake way for a new school built in 1923-24 (above, p. 207),\nthough their (blocked) windows remain.\n ANOULCS\n\n1 Al-Umari, Masélik, 159.\n\n2 Op. cit., 165.\n\n3 Mujir, ii, 38.\n\n4 Ms. Pococke 362, fol. 132a, and Ms. Marsh 677, fol. 125b.\n\n5 Sauvaire, Histoire de Jérusalem, 149.

The double bend of the original entrance would have prevented the\nintroduction of inflexible objects more than two or three metres long.\n\n19 Incised in the masonry of this wall were graffiti in Hebrew which tempted\nMayer (L.A. Mayer, ‘Hebraische Inschriften im Haram zu Jerusalem’, ZDPV, lviii,\n1930, 229) to associate the Is‘ardiyya with the Zawiyat al-Lawi (‘the Zawiya of the\nLevite’) mentioned by al-‘Umari. These inscriptions have since been effaced.\nAccording to al-‘Umari’s description (cited above, p. 104) the Zawiyat al-Lawi\nshould be placed rather towards the Farisiyya Madrasa (above, p. 337).\n\n20 The upper part of the Herodian walls enclosing the sanctuaries at Jerusalem\nand Hebron were articulated in a series of pilasters, see for Jerusalem: C.

The main feature is an\narchway which appears originally to have been the only\nopening into the chamber. The archway is blocked with large\nwell-cut stones so as to leave only a small square window\nopening in the centre. To the right of the archway a low door\nhas been opened in the original masonry, probably when the\narchway was blocked. This doorway is now the only entrance to\nthe chamber.\n\nA later stairway giving access to upper floors added in 1811\nrises from east to west across the street frontage concealing\nmuch of it from view. It was dismantled in 1983 allowing more\nof the masonry to be examined ( plate 34.1). It has since been\n replaced by a modern stair. A small passage under the stair\nmaintains access to the entrance door.\n\nThe stonework of the street frontage appears to be\nhomogeneous except for the later masonry around the\nentrance and blocking the archway (see plate 34.1). A kite-\nshaped shield carved on the left-hand springer of the archway,\nsimilar to others seen at the Bab al-Silsila, the Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-\nDin and the Turba of Barka Khan (above, p. 115), suggests that\nthe archway was in existence by the early seventh/thirteenth\ncentury.\n\nrae as tae EO SE Chika emer ori reo\n\n INTERIOR (plan, fig. 34.3; plate 34.2)\n\nThe entrance opens directly into the chamber, which is roofed\nby a barrel vault spanning from east to west. A pointed arch of\nwell-cut ashlars spans a recess in the north wall next to the\nstreet. This arch springs directly from the west wall and, at the\nother end, from a respond occupying the north-east corner of\nthe chamber. It does not correspond to the (blocked) archway\nin the street frontage, being greater both in span and height. In\nthe south wall is a smaller recess under a crudely-built\nsegmental arch, possibly a later modification. Some suggestion\nof other changes in the structure is made by a break (shown as\na dotted line on the plan, fig. 34.3) running east-west across the\nvault.\n\nThe chamber houses a stone cenotaph (1.98m long, 0.79m\nwide, 1.05m high), presumably a later addition, projecting from\nthe east wall. Whose grave the cenotaph marks is not known. It\nis possible that the window and door in the street frontage were\nmade when the grave was introduced in order to restrict access\nto it. A clue as to when that might have been is given by a finely\ncarved octagonal post of marble at the west end of the cenotaph\n(plate 34.2). This post appears to be in secondary use for it has\na slot cut into one side that serves no useful purpose in its\npresent position. Normally such posts marked the four corners\nof Mamluk cenotaphs (p. 191), and the style and carving of this\none is typically Mamluk (fig. 34.4) but its solitary placement as\na headstone conforms to Ottoman funerary practice.” We may\ntherefore be justified in assuming that the grave is Ottoman.\n\nThe evolution of the site may thus be summarized:\n\n(1) Structure in existence in the early seventh/thirteenth\ncentury, possibly used as a shop, with an archway opening on\nthe street.\n\n(2) Endowed by Siraj al-Din ‘Umar as a Koran School in 761/\n1360 with no known architectural modifications.\n\n(3) Used to house a grave in the Ottoman period when the\npresent cenotaph”? was built and, in all probability, the present\nwindow and door in the the street frontage were inserted.\n sVUELD\n\n1 Mujir, ii, 45.\n\n2 Asali, Ma Ghid, 134.\n\n3 Mujir, loc. cit.\n\n4 Mujir, loc. cit.\n\n5 Defter 602, 429.

A later (Ottoman) structure abuts on its south end. A\nparapet and cornice moulding over the portico to the south\nstop about 5m short of the facade. Originally it must have\ncontinued northward. It was removed, presumably to provide\na firmer footing for the east wall of the Manjakiyya.\n\nAcyma recta moulding defines the top of the facade, rising\nin two places as a sort of rectangular pediment over the two\nmain features: the prayer hall over the portico at Bab al-Nazir\nand the double-arched window of the loggia. Apart from the\nloggia window the fenestration is relatively plain, consisting of\na somewhat irregularly spaced series of seven rectangular\nwindows of varying widths and heights. The soffits of the\n masonry course above each window are undercut to relieve the\nload on the lintels. Five of the windows — two on each side of\nthe loggia window and one at the prayer hall — are surmounted\nby smaller rectangular windows. Five spouts pierce the upper\npart of the wall, under the cornice moulding, to drain rainwater\nfrom the roof. They are logically placed above the blank\nmasonry between the windows.\n\nThe windows (and the floor) of the prayer hall are at a\nhigher level than the others since it lies above that bay of the\nportico in front of Bab al-Nazir which has a dome, supported on\na splendid muqarnas transition zone (plates 35.3 and 35.4),\nwhich rises higher than the cross vaults of the neighbouring\nbays of the portico.\n The loggia window is composed of twin pointed arches\nspringing from three marble columns with re-used Crusader\ncapitals and bases on the side columns (p/ate 35.12). The\ncentral column has a re-used base but its capital appears to be\na Mamlik copy of the other two (plate 35.13). Each of the\ncolumns is decorated with an unusual carved band midway\nbetween base and capital. The voussoirs of the arches are of\nblack and yellowish ablagq, as are the masonry courses above,\nwhich contain two roundels of radial ablaq voussoirs. Each\nroundel encloses a small central oculus (now filled with a disk\nof some reddish substance but shown only roughly blocked in\nvan Berchem’s 1914 photograph”). A moulding outlines the\nablaq decoration above the arches and extends around the two\nroundels. This moulding is similar in profile to the one framing\nthe lintels on the facade of the Amalikiyya (see p. 311 above).\n\nENTRANCE AND LOWER FLOORS (plan, fig. 35.4)\nThe building is now reached through a triple-arched portal on\n\nSe Se ene ee 58 eee Na Bae ee a ed ne “DIN nn I Ridooie fone hi ate.\n 35.21). This portal was erected at the time of the remodelling in\n1340/1921-22, the date given in an inscription on glazed tiles\nabove the arches (plate 35.9). It leads into a grand entrance\nstaircase, built at the same time, which rises through some\nearlier vaults to the upper floor (plate 35.11).\n\nAn anepigraphic Mamluk portal (plate 35.10) to the west\nof the present entrance is almost certainly the original entrance\nto the Manjakiyya. The architecture of this portal, notably\ncorner columns with simple mugarnas capitals and three-\ntiered mugarnas corbelling supporting a smooth ashlar\nsemidome, suggests a mid-eighth/fourteenth-century date of\nconstruction. The only building of that date listed in this vicinity\nby Mujir al-Din is the Manjakiyya.\n\nThe entrance door opens into a vestibule (see plan, fig.\n35.3), from which a door opens into a flight of thirteen steps\nrising northward. At the top of this flight of steps a door opens\nnorth into a labyrinthine complex of dimly-lit rooms\ninterconnected by a dog-leg passage. The rooms at the western\nextremity of the complex, which overlook the courtyard of the\nRibat of ‘Ala’ al-Din, are mostly if not entirely Ottoman (see\nabove, p. 125), but the remainder must be earlier, for the\nManjakiyya stands partly on their vaults. Whether or not any of\nthem belong to the Manjakiyya itself is impossible to tell. None\nthe less, it is worth noting that toward the north end of this floor\nthe passage leads to an open courtyard (divided by modern\npartitions) with an zwan opening on its south side (see fig.\n35.4). To be sure, the structures on the west side of the\ncourtyard are Ottoman, but they may have been rebuilt, The\neast wall of the courtyard is the Haram wall, in which Open a\ndoor and a window. This courtyard and iwén are the only part\n of the structure that bear any resemblance to a ‘conventional’\nMamluk madrasa.\n\nFrom this level a continuation of the stairway from the\nvestibule would have led to the upper floor, but it no longer\nsurvives. Its position is not known. There are several blocked\nopenings that might have led into such a continuation; perhaps\nthe most likely is one on the east side of a landing at the top of\nthe first flight of steps (see plan, fig. 35.4) since it would have\nhad the advantage of leading as directly as possible to the upper\nfloor.\n\nMujir al-Din lists the Manjakiyya as one of those buildings\nthat could be entered from inside as well as outide the Haram.\nAccess from within the Haram was by way of a stone spiral\nstaircase that led from the back of the portico.°! This staircase\nmust have risen from the second bay of the portico from the\nnorth, where an excision in the vaulting may indicate the\nposition of its entrance, as shown dotted on the plan, fig. 35.4.\nIt is now inaccessible.\n\nUPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 35.5)\n\nThe 1921-22 remodelling meant that ‘very little is left of the\noriginal building. The inside . . . has been mostly gutted and\nrebuilt’°! It is true that the bulk of the western part of the\nbuilding seems to have been reconstructed at that time, but\nmuch of the eastern part above the portico and the southern\npart overlooking the street appears to retain its original form.\nThe correlation between the fenestration and the plan of the\neastern range of rooms overlooking the Haram (marked “A-E\non the plan) indicates that they have undergone few alterations.\n The one noteworthy change concerns room ‘A’, which is\nnow roofed by a cross vault but was, as early photographs such\nas plates 35.5 and 35.7 reveal, originally a yard open to the sky.\nThis may explain the presence of a spout protruding through\nthe Haram facade (see fig. 35.7) beside the north-east corner of\nthe room: it was there to drain rainwater from the floor of the\nyard. Six steps against the south wall of that yard lead up to a\ndoor into the prayer hall, which is roofed by a shallow dome on\nmuch-replastered and somewhat amorphous pendentives. A\npointed-arched recess in the middle of the south wall contains\na plain mibrab (plate 35.14), which is surmounted by a\nwindow.\n Al-Manjakiyya\n\nA door in the west wall of room ‘A’ opens into a central\ngallery around the modern entrance staircase. The gallery is\nroofed by three cross vaults, the middle one rising to a lantern\nat the crown. The octagonal base of the lantern is set contrary\nto Mamluk custom with the sides, not points, coinciding with\nthe arrises of the vault (see plate 35.15 and fig. 35.5), which\nSuggests that the vaulting is not original. Early photographs\nconfirm that the vaulting belongs to the later remodelling, for\nthey show that the roof of this area was once lower than the\nroofs of the rooms to the east, not higher as it is now. The raised\nwalls supporting that new roof are pierced by clerestorey\nwindows, some of which have been blocked by the subsequent\naddition of the council chamber. Doors in the east wall of the\ngallery open into rooms ‘B’ and ‘C’, lit by windows overlooking\nthe Haram.\n\nAt the north end of the gallery are two archways (plate\n35.16). The west one is blocked except for two windows, one\nabove the other, admitting light from the gallery to room ‘G’.\nThe upper window has a little fluted conch at its head. The east\narchway leads into a long corridor, roofed by a series of cross\nvaults, which comes to a dead end at the north wall of the\nbuilding. On the east side of the corridor a door opens into\nroom ‘C’ and two others open into ‘D’ and ‘E’. Between the\ndoors into rooms ‘C’ and ‘D’ an arched recess opens east into\nthe loggia. In front of that recess the series of cross vaults is\ninterrupted by a wider bay with a small octagonal oculus at the\ncrown, which appears to be part of the remodelling (plate\n35.17). The spiral staircase from the portico may have emerged\nhereabouts, but there is no trace of it now.\n\nThe loggia enjoys a magnificent view of the Haram\nthrough its double window. The dome over the loggia is\nsupported by a twelve-sided drum on double-faceted\npendentives which taper down to bevelled points in the\ncorners (plate 35.18). Pointed-arched windows open in each\nside of the drum and, between them, little pendentives\noutlined by a plaster bead moulding complete the transition to\nthe circular base of the dome (plate 35.18). Two doors open\nnorth and south from the loggia into the adjoining rooms.\nNeither has reveals and they seem to be later insertions, though\nthe barrel vault of room ‘D’ has a small excision above the door\ninto it, which may indicate that that door is original.\n\nBeyond the entrance to the loggia the corridor is lit by\nthree segmental-arched windows in its west wall. These\nwindows appear modern, perhaps replacing earlier windows.\nAt the north end of the corridor another modern window\nopens on the Haram. Originally there was a staircase at this end\nof the corridor, which led up to the roof. It was lit by a window\nin the north wall of the building and had a doorway at its head,\nboth visible in early photographs (see plates 35.5 and 35.7), but\nthey no longer exist.\n\nDoors in the west wall of the corridor opposite those into\nthe loggia and room ‘C’ give access to rooms ‘F and ‘G’, both of\nwhich have modern vaults and appear to belong to the 1920s\nremodelling. Between these two rooms a barrel-vaulted\npassageway runs west, with doors opening north and south\nfrom it into these rooms, before turning south to run along the\nwest boundary of the building. The passageway is lit by six\npossibly modern windows in the west boundary wall. Windows\nin the east wall of the passageway admit borrowed light to\nrooms ‘G-I’, all of which appear to be part of the remodelling.\nToward the south end of the corridor a door opens west into\nroom ‘J’, which houses modern latrines.\n\nAt its south end the corridor opens into a tall chamber\n(marked ‘stairwell’ on the plan), which contains a modern\nflight of reinforced concrete stairs that give access to the\ncouncil chamber (p/ate 35.19). The barrel vault of the stairwell\nappears to be modern. A shallow-domed room (K) to the west\nof the stairwell is also a later addition, as may be inferred from\na vertical joint in the exterior masonry between it and a small\nzwan-like chamber (L) which opens on the south side of the\nstairwell. This chamber sits above the entrance portal and\nappears to belong to the original foundation.\n Also part of the original foundation is a cross-vaulted hall\n(M) which sits on the earlier vault of the outer porch at Bab al-\nNazir. The date of that porch is not known but its semicircular\nfrontal arch (see plate 35.20) would tend to indicate a pre-\nCrusader construction. The Ayyabid wall of the Wafa’iyya (no.\n44) on the south side of the street abuts against the porch and\nis clearly posterior. Hall ‘M’ is entered from the south end of the\ngallery (see plate 35.15). A group of three windows in its west\nwall gives a splendid view over the city (plate 35.22). The larger\ncentral window is surmounted by a slit, and has a little stone\nbalcony supported by two roll corbels projecting from its sill\n(see plate 35.23). These windows are arranged to be as nearly\nas possible in the centre of the west wall of the hall, which\nmeans they are not centred on the earlier porch below.\n\nINTERPRETATION\nAlthough little can be deduced with confidence from the layout\n of the building owing to the major remodelling done in the\n1920s, it seems possible that the founder, Manjak al-Yasuff,\nintended the building to include residential quarters for his\nown use during his term as tarkbdn in Jerusalem. As noted\nabove, there is little in the present layout that is typical of a\nconventional Mamluk madrasa, which is the term Mujir al-Din\nuses to describe it. Not enough is known about the residences\nof Mamlik amirs to say what was typical, in Jerusalem at least,\nbut certain features like the small prayer hall and the domed\nloggia with its fine view and its associated staircase connecting\nit with the Haram, seem appropriate to such a residence. The\npossibility cannot be ruled out that a madrasa was located on\nthe lower floor—where there is an open courtyard and an zwan\n—and that the upper floor initially served as Manjak’s temporary\nresidence. The mention of a ‘residence on the roof in a tenth/\nsixteenth-century Ottoman document (see above, p. 386)\nmight recall that original arrangement.\n 1 Mujir, 375.\n\n2 CIA (Haram), 115-16.\n\n3 Al-‘Umari, Masdlik, 160-61.\n\n4 Mujjir, ii, 37-8.\n\n5 GIA (Ville), 284-5.\n\n6 Mujir, /oc. cit.

Mujir, 392,\n61 This is known from a letter dated 7 July 1925 in the files of the Palestine\n\nArchaeological (Rockefeller) Museum (File no. 78 Jerusalem’, letter reference\nnumber 4474/ATQ/1758),\n ','HARAM FAGADE, ENTRANCE, UPPER FLOOR, INTERPRETATION'),(36,'STREET FACADE (figs. 36.5 and 36.10; plate 36.1)\nThe facade is bounded by the Kilaniyya to the left (west) and by\nthe narrow upstand of rough stonework, evidently all that\nremains of some earlier building, to the right. A later shop\nfurther to the east abuts on this masonry upstand.\nNotwithstanding Taz’s illustriousness, the facade of his\nfoundation is unusually modest. The entrance is a simple\nundecorated doorway quite different from the grand entrances\nto the pious foundations erected by his peers. The only\nelaborate decoration is concentrated around an iron-grilled\nwindow which occupies a large part of the lower facade.\nEnclosed by a quirked ogee frame moulding, the window is\nconstructed in red and cream-coloured ablaq masonry. A\nmonolithic lintel bears the dedicatory inscription and flanking\nblazons. Above the lintel a course of ablag revetment Is\ndesigned to resemble a flat relieving arch with trefoil joggling\nto interlock its five pseudo-voussoirs. The masonry coursing of\n the window does not coincide with that of the rest of the facade,\ngiving the impression that the window has been inserted into\nan existing wall.\n\nA cavetto moulding runs across the ground floor facade,\nseparating it from the upper floor. The cavetto has moulded\nstops at either end; the left-hand stop abuts on the Kilaniyya and\nthe right-hand stop abuts on the masonry upstand that supports\nthe east end of the upper floor where it oversails the ground\nfloor facade by 0.59m.\n\nImmediately above the lintel of the entrance door and\ncentred a little to the right of it there is a strange opening\nblocked with a coursed rubble infill. The semicircular head of\nthe opening is not an arch — there are no voussoirs — and it is\nsupported now only by the infill wall; when open there must\nhave been some other means of support, possibly a timber\nframe. The opening has been pierced through the masonry of\nthe facade presumably in Ottoman times since a stone,\napparently in re-use, in its left jamb bears traces of a lightly-\ncarved fretwork pattern typical of Ottoman work. Two blocked\nsockets, one on each side of the opening, suggest some sort of\ncantilevered support, possibly for a timber mashrabiyya oriel\nwindow like those projecting from many neighbouring\nbuildings (plate 29.1). Small cavities cut in the masonry above\nand on each side of the opening would have helped to secure\nsuch a structure, while four small sockets in the second course\nof masonry above street level might have retained some\nsupporting framework. Traces of plaster around the opening\nare further signs that this part of the facade was enclosed at\none time.\n\nThe masonry of the upper facade is quite homogeneous,\nevidently all Mamlik work (plate 36.2). The fenestration is\nsymmetrical about the central axis. The main feature is a large\npointed-arched opening concealed by a timber oriel window\nof typical nineteenth-century Ottoman construction.\nPresumably it replaces an earlier Mamlak mashrabiyya\nwindow of which no trace survives. It is flanked by a small\ngrilled window on either side, each with an undercut slit in the\nstone course above its lintel. Above the arched opening are\nthree plain windows, the central one now blocked. A cavetto\nmoulding with downturned finials at each end runs across the\ntop of the facade; the carving of this moulding is much rougher\nthan that of the lower cavetto, possibly because it is less clearly\nvisible from the street.\n\nVESTIBULE (plan, fig. 36.3)\n\nThe entrance door opens into a low vestibule from which\ndoors in each side and in front (plate 36.3) lead to the three\ncomponent parts of the building; two cross-vaulted chambers\n(A and B) to the west; a passageway to two vaulted halls (C and\nD) to the north; and a staircase on the east side leading to the\nupper floor. The present form of the vestibule is not original\n\nCS Tl  — SC ee wt [marae Sao es\n and the various alterations to it are discussed below.\n FRONT CHAMBERS ‘A’ AND 8B’\n\nThe floors of these two chambers are raised 0.93m above the\nfloor of the vestibule, requiring four steps from the vestibule\nup to the first chamber (A). These steps reduce the clearance\nunder the doorhead to 1.75m — too low for easy passsage — and\nit seems likely that the floor level of the chambers was\noriginally much closer to that of the vestibule (see below, p.\n408).\n\nThe dedicatory inscription on the window lintel leads one\nto suppose that chamber ‘A’ contains the grave of the founder,\nthough there is no other sign of it. The ceiling is and must\nalways have been cross-vaulted, not domed as was usual for\nMamluk tombs.\n\nA pointed-arched opening placed off centre in the north\nwall of chamber ‘A’ leads to the second cross-vaulted chamber,\n‘B’. A pointed wall arch 0.61m deep occupying the full length of\nthe west side of chamber ‘B’ accounts for the asymmetrical\nplacement of that opening. A rectangular window in the north\nwall of the chamber opens into the first of the northern halls\n(C). This window is partly blocked by an arched recess ina later\nwall built against that end of the chamber; the purpose of the\nsecondary wall is not apparent.\n\nNORTHERN HALLS ‘C’ AND ‘D’\n\nFrom the entrance vestibule a plain door (plate 363) opens\ninto an unlit passageway (plate 36.4) which runs alongside\nchamber ‘B’, described above, to give access to the two\nnorthern halls. A late Ottoman inscription built into the east\nwall of the passage was first recorded in 1865 by Sandreczki in\nthe Harat al-Sharaf, about 100m north-west of the Taziyya.”8 In\n1914 van Berchem” saw the same inscription in the same place\nas Sandreczki (near where we subsequently found a Mamluk\nepitaph”). Its presence now in the Taziyya testifies to building\nwork there at some time after 1914 when for unknown reasons\nit was transferred. A blocked opening beside the inscription in\nthe east wall of the passage, under a cross-vaulted bay, may\noriginally have been a window that was put out of commission\nby the later construction of adjoining buildings. The present\noccupant, Mr Abdullah Dajani, says that his wife’s grandfather\nmade several alterations to the property about seventy years\nago.\n\nAt its north end the passage opens into large hall ‘C’, the\nfloor of which is covered with rubbish. It is cross-vaulted at its\nsouthern end and barrel-vaulted to the north where a later vault\n(plate 36.5) has been inserted to provide an entresol. Access to\nthis later entresol is by means of a staircase from the upper\nstorey cut in the thickness of the eastern boundary wall (fig.\n36.4).\n Various openings pierce all four walls of hall ‘C’. Beside\nthe exit from the passage in the south wall is the window into\nchamber ‘B’ described above. A recess above that window\nserves no obvious purpose. Four openings in the east wall are\narranged in pairs, one above the other (plate 36.6). The pointed\narches in undisturbed masonry of the two southern openings\n(the lower of which is blocked) suggest that they belong to the\noriginal construction. Of the two northern openings, the lower\none with its well-built jambs also appears to be original, though\nits head has been dismantled and replaced by a relieving arch\nbuilt in the outer face of the wall at some later date (plate 36.6).\nThe window above it appears to be a later insertion, possibly to\nlight the entresol. In the north wall a small window opens\nunder the crown of the vault. In the west wall there is a wall\narch, now blocked up (plate 36.7), and, to the north of it and\npartly blocked by the entresol, two openings into the western\nhall. Both openings are formed in well-built ashlars, one of\nwhich bears the mason’s mark referred to above. The left-hand\n(southern) opening has a flat lintel, the right-hand one a slightly\n pointed arch (plate 36.8).\n\nApart from these two openings, the western hall, ‘D’, has\nno other doors or windows, only five arched recesses (two in\nthe south wall, two in the west wall (plate 36.9), and one in the\nnorth wall). If these recesses once contained openings there is\nno trace of them now except in the north wall recess where the\nlintel of a blocked door or window is identifiable; the lower\npart of all the walls is concealed by an accumulation of rubbish\non the floor.\n\nThe east and north external walls of halls ‘C’ and ‘D’ display\nat ground floor level a general uniformity of construction. The\nmasonry of the east wall is interrupted by what seem to be\nsecondary — structural modifications including two\nsuperimposed semicircular arches (plate 36.6) apparently\nintroduced to reinforce the wall and, immediately to the north\nof them, a tall sloping-topped buttress with the same function.\nThe same masonry returns to form the north boundary wall,\nnow largely obscured by accumulated debris.\n UPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 36.4)\nIn the north-east corner of the entrance vestibule (plate 36.3)\nfour steps lead east up to a small landing from which a further\nsix steps rise north to another landing with a door to the south\nleading over a high step to a small mezzanine chamber over the\nvestibule (section, fig. 36.9). This mezzanine appears to be a\nlater intrusion formed by the construction of a new floor\nspanning across the vestibule (which originally rose\nunobstructed to the full height of the present mezzanine\nceiling). The piercing of the round-headed opening visible in\nthe facade (above, p. 403) must have been done at the same\ntime. An original recess in the east wall of the vestibule was\npresumably blocked then too; it seems originally to have\nhoused the lower steps of the staircase to the upper floor,\nreplaced by the four steps which now protrude into the\nvestibule.\n\nFrom the landing beside the mezzanine the staircase\n(plate 36.10) continues up to a landing where one door Opens\nwest into a barrel-vaulted ivan and another Opens north into a\n\ncourtyard. All the upper floor rooms are reached from the\ncourtyard.\n To the south is the zvdin, its pointed-arched opening now\nblocked up save for three new windows (plate 36.11). A door\nin the south-east corner of the ian gives access to a stair that\noriginally led up to the roof; the opening on to the roof is now\nblocked. A timber floor (see plate 36.12) has been inserted\nacross the iwdan at some time to provide an extra room in the\nvault space (section, fig. 36.6). This new room is reached by way\nof a later external stairway that runs against the wall blocking\nthe iwan (plate 36.11) before turning into a corridor alongside\nthe iwén’s west wall. This corridor occupies the site of a\npresumed gallery that originally belonged to the Kilaniyya\n(above, p. 335).\n\nA door flanked by two windows (the west one now\nblocked) in the rear wall of the ivan (plate 36.13) opens into\na large cross-vaulted hall. The principal feature of this main hall\nis a tall pointed-arched opening into the timber oriel window\nthat protrudes from the street facade (above, p. 403). Low\nwindows flank the arched opening (plate 36.14) and three\nsmaller windows (the central one now blocked) surmount it.\nArched recesses fill the west and east walls of the hall; a small\nwindow opens under the crown of the eastern recess.\n The other rooms on the upper floor are arranged round\nthe north, west and east sides of the courtyard. Almost all of\nthem appear to be Ottoman or later. The paving of the\ncourtyard appears, however, to be original though its former\nextent is not known; the later buildings have given it a Z-shape\nin plan.\n\nAt the south-east corner traces of a springing course in the\nmasonry above the door of the main staircase seem to indicate\nthat there was once some sort of porch there. Nothing else\nsurvives of it. A well-head about 2m north of the door would\n have been sheltered by such a porch. The present well-head is\nmodern but it probably replaces an earlier one. It connects\nwith a cistern beneath the ground floor by way of a masonry\nshaft built out from the east wall of hall ‘C’ on the ground floor.\n\nAt the south-west corner the stairs up to the later room in\nthe vault of the zvdn described above separate the western\nabutment of the zwan from two small chambers (plate 36.15),\nthe southern one cross-vaulted and oriented north-south, the\nnorthern one oriented east-west. Both are later additions, as\nobviously are the three privies on the east side of the courtyard.\nTo the north of the privies is the entrance to the stairs down to\nthe entresol (above, p. 403) and, in the north-east corner of the\ncourtyard, a modern room built during the present tenant’s\nlifetime.\n\nTo the west of that modern room stand the remains of a\nruined vault (plate 36.16), evidently structurally homogeneous\nwith a large domically-vaulted room beyond, which is entered\nthrough a plain doorway under the ruined vault. At the north\nend of this room a barrel-vaulted recess, spanning the full\nwidth of the room, leads up one step to the main domically-\nvaulted area to the south. The domical vault is supported by\npointed wall arches on three sides and the barrel vault of the\nrecess on the north side, a typical Ottoman construction\ntechnique. The decoration too is typically Ottoman: paired\nwindows with complex ogee heads surmounted by a central\noculus, a very elaborately carved stone sideboard (plate 36.17)\nopposite the entrance door, and ornamental plasterwork on\nthe dome (plate 36.18) in a style that can be dated to the\neighteenth century.*!\n\nBATH-HOUSE\n\nA small door in the north wall of the domically-vaulted room\nleads into an exquisite private bath-house comprising small\ninterconnected chambers with perforated domes (plates\n36.19-36.24) which are very similar in design and execution to\nthe domes of Mamluk bath-houses. It may be that this private\nbath is a Mamlik construction retained during the Ottoman\nrebuilding, but the possibility that it is Ottoman cannot be ruled\nout.\n\nPURPOSE OF THE BUILDING\n\nThe layout of the Taziyya is quite unusual. The inclusion of\nearlier structures within the complex, and subsequent\nalterations to it, do not conceal the fact that it has few of the\nusual features of a tomb or of a madrasa. Even the zwdan on the\nupper floor is untypical, serving rather as an antechamber to\nthe main hall. While it is impossible now to assign a specific\npurpose to each room or group of rooms, the general\narrangement is that of a somewhat grand residence. The\npresence of a small bath-house on the upper floor tends to\nconfirm this impression.\n\nHow, then, is the dedicatory inscription on the street\nfacade to be explained? That inscription states that this is the\nfunerary complex (turba) of Sayf al-Din Taz who died in 763/\n1362. It must, therefore, have been cut after his death. On the\none hand there is some agreement in historical sources that Taz\nwas buried in Damascus and, in any case, if the present building\nwas built to include a tomb for Taz we should expect to finda\ndomed chamber for the tomb. There is none. Yet on the other\nhand the present tenant claims that there is one grave under the\nfirst of the ground floor chambers (A), next to the street, and\nthree under the second (B). The raised floor of these two\nchambers suggests that some sort of grave markers or\ncenotaphs might have been left intact under a new floor which\nwas laid at some time when the building was remodelled for\ncommercial or domestic use. The bequeathal of three tomb\ncoverings in 781/1379 (above, p. 401) may also indicate the\npresence of one or more graves at that time.\n\nHowever, whether or not burials were made in the\nbuilding, it seems reasonably clear that it was not designed with\nae purpose in mind. A likely sequence of events may be listed\nthus:\n (1) Taz retires to Jerusalem in Jumada I 762/March 1361 and\nacquires the site — already partly or wholly occupied by existing\nstructures — for his new residence.\n\n(2) He endows it as a madrasa with members of his family\nnominated as overseers of the endowment.\n\n(3) At the end of 762/1361 he is transferred to Damascus where\nhe dies on 22 Dhi’l-Hijja 763/10 October 1362 and is buried in\n the Cemetery of the Sufis there.\n\n(4) Memorial window — with a funerary inscription and Taz’s\nblazons carved on the lintel — is inserted in the facade.\n\n(5) Building functions as a madrasa with a’ Koran School.\nDomestic appurtenances retained, presumably for use by the\noverseers of the endowment, Taz’s own descendants.\n 2 CIA (Ville), 286.\n\n3, Shuja‘z, i, 150.\n\n4 Sultik, ii, 731.\n\n5 Sulttk, ii, 746 and 752.\n\n6 Khitat, ii, 73; Sulitk, ii, 859 and 897.\n\n7 Nui. v, 147; Sulttk, iii, 3 (Taz first took refuge with his sister’s husband, Tuqtay\nal-Dawadar) and 7 (Taz replaced Arghin al-Kamili, who took his fief in Egypt,\nMinyat Bani Khasib).\n\n8 Nuj., v, 151 (correct the date 758); Sultik, iii, 40.\n\n9 Nuj., v, 175 and 183-4; Sultik, iii, 65 and 78.\n\n10 Durar, ii, 315.\n\n11 Dhayl, Cairo Ms. Ta’rikh 5615, 25 (Taz died in the Ablaq Palace in Damascus),\nbut Nuj., v, 183-4 (Taz died in Jerusalem).\n\n12 Suliik, ii, 886-7.\n\n13 Durar, ii, 75; Nuj., v, 522-538.

The\nlower courses appear to belong to some earlier structure of\nunknown date, the ruins of which served as the basis for the\npresent building. The upper courses are of smaller stones\nabove that earlier masonry. These incorporate at the east end of\nthe north frontage the springing of an arch that once spanned\nthe street (see plates 4.1 and 4.2). The upper storeys are later,\nalmost certainly Ottoman additions.\n\nThe fenestration is quite plain, consisting of one\nrectangular window in the north frontage and three in the east\nfrontage. The middle window in the east frontage has a typical\nMamluk iron grille; the other two are narrow slits.\n\nThe entrance portal (plate 37.1) at the south end of the\neast frontage is remarkably plain. It consists ofa pointed-arched\nrecess containing the entrance door, which has been reduced\nin width and height at some time. The original lintel, two\ncourses above the present one, is surmounted by a relieving\narch of simply-joggled voussoirs with rebated joints. In the\ntympanum, one course above the relieving arch, is 4\nrectangular recess with a bevelled border, which evidently was\nintended to accommodate an inscription. The portal lacks the\ncustomary stone benches on either side.\n\nINTERIOR (plan, fig. 37.3)\n\nThree steps lead up from the street to the entrance door, which\nopens into a vaulted vestibule. A door in the far (west) wall of\nthe vestibule leads into a cross-vaulted chamber from which a\nstaircase rises west then east to the upper floors.\n\nA doorway in the north wall of the vestibule leads into a\npassage cut through a massive wall (2.31m thick) that seems to\nbe a remnant of an earlier structure. A deep recess (measuring\n2.45m from west to east) opens in the east side of the passage.\nIt appears to have been hollowed out of the core of that massive\nwall. It is lit from the street by a high-level slit window, and now\ncontains a privy.\n\nThe passage leads to a large hall (marked ‘a’ on the plan,\n\nJig. 37.3) lit by the grilled window in the east frontage. This hall\nis roofed in three bays by barrel vaults at the east and west ends\nand a taller vault between them. The centre vault may bea later\ninsertion, added when the upper floor was developed, in which\ncase this part of the hall will have been open to the sky.\n\nA door in the middle of the north wall of hall ‘A’ leads into\nhall ‘B’, which is now divided by later partitions that were\nprobably added to support load-bearing walls on the upper\nfloor. The hall is cross-vaulted and lit by a high-level slit\n window in the east wall and a larger window in a recess in the\nnorth wall. A well-head in the south-east corner of the hall gives\naccess to a Cistern.\n\nIn the west wall of hall ‘B’ a door opens into what is now a\nshop (‘Lions Gate Bazaar’), but which may once have formed\n part of the ribat. The shop comprises two vaulted rooms (C and\nD), which are connected by a wide opening, presumably\nmodern, in the common wall. The shop’s wide doorway on the\nstreet is obviously modern (see plate 37.3), perhaps replacing\nan earlier window.\n ','STREET FRONTAGES, INTERIOR'),(38,'ENTRANCE (plate 38.1; fig. 38.3)\n\nA short flight of five steps rises eastward against the base of the\nminaret to the threshold of the entrance portal. The portal\nconsists of a tall pointed-arched recess with a door in the rear\nwall flanked by stone benches. The door lintel, still bearing\nfaint traces of the foundation inscription, is surmounted by a\nrelieving arch of red and cream-coloured ablaq joggled\nvoussoirs. Above this arch the stonework has been renewed\naround the restoration inscription. The tympanum of the\n portal is filled with four tiers of muqarnas corbelling. The\nportal arch is slightly recessed in the surrounding masonry and\nframed by a cyma reversa moulding around the extrados.\n\nThe entrance door opens into a small vestibule from\nwhich a dog-leg stair rises north, turns east then north again to\na landing with a blocked door in its west wall. This door\npresumably led into a chamber within the base. From the first\nlanding the stair continues to rise northward before turning\neast against the Haram’s north enclosing wall to emerge on the\nroof of the portico. 4.30m to the south a door in the east side of\nthe masonry plinth (plate 38.2) leads to the spiral staircase\nwithin the core of the minaret.\n\nSHAFT (elevation, fig. 38.3; section, fig. 38.4; plate 38.1)\n\nThe masonry plinth supporting the minaret is rectangular in\nplan, measuring 4.58m (the same size as the base) from east to\nwest and 4.00m from north to south. The top of the plinth is\nchamfered on all four sides. The chamfering of the west side is\nwider and deeper to reduce the top of the plinth to a square in\nplan. Above the plinth a series of prismatic triangles and\npyramidal corner buttresses (see plate 38.2) makes the\ntransition from square to octagon. A roll moulding decorates\nthe top edge of the octagon, above which inverted muqarnas\nniches round off the eight corners (see plate 38.3) to complete\nthe transition from the plinth to the cylindrical shaft.\n\nThe plain ashlar masonry of the shaft is relieved by three\nmoulded string courses and two friezes of incised joggling. The\nlowest of the three ‘storeys’ is quite featureless except for two\nslit windows, one facing roughly north and the other roughly\nsouth, which light the internal staircase. A roll moulding\nseparates this storey from the next. Half-way up the second\nstorey are two circular windows, one facing roughly south-east,\nthe other north-west. The windows are surrounded by circular\npanels of incised counterchange joggling which interrupt an\nincised frieze of similar joggling (see plate 38.4). A cavetto\nmoulding decorated with a repeating muqarnas motif\nseparates the second storey from the third. A single north-\nfacing circular window surrounded by incised joggling\ninterrupts an incised frieze similar to that in the second storey.\nOn the west side of the shaft the continuity of this frieze is\nbroken by two stones incised with a more elaborate\ncounterchange motif (fig. 38.5), which surely indicates some\nlater rebuilding.\n\nAta level three courses above the frieze, the top courses of\nthe shaft and the muezzin’s gallery were dismantled and\n completely renewed in 1346/1927-28, possibly as a result of\ndamage caused by the earthquake in July 1927. Early\nphotographs such as the one cited in note 3 show that before\nthat renovation there was a south-facing circular window at the\nsame level as the north-facing one in the third storey and that\nthe muezzin’s gallery was supported by two tiers of continuous\ncircumferential corbelling (see plate 54.9). The present\nmuezzin’s gallery is supported by two tiers of muqarnas\ncorbelling which, like that used in the nearly contemporaneous\nrenovation of the Fakhriyya Minaret (no. 23), was evidently\nmodelled on corbelling at the Ghawanima Minaret (no. 10).\n\nDATE\nThe base including the entrance portal with the foundation\n inscription is — apart from the incorporated pier of the earlier\nHaram portico — obviously Mamlik. The plinth and zone of\ntransition appear to be integral with the base and so to be\nMamluk also. Similar zones of transition were used in eighth/\nfourteenth-century minarets in Egypt’ and Syria.° The zone of\ntransition would support either an octagonal or a cylindrical\nshaft. Octagonal-shafted minarets were common in Syria’ and\nPalestine,” though none exists in Jerusalem. On the other hand,\nwe know of only two other eighth/fourteenth-century Mamluk\nminarets with circular shafts, both in Aleppo” and both different\nin style and execution from the Bab al-Asbat Minaret. All other\nminarets with circular shafts in Jerusalem are Ottoman. One at\nthe Jamr\' al-Mawlawiyya is surprisingly similar to the Bab al-\nAsbat Minaret; it bears an unpublished inscription recording\n that it was built in 995/1586-87. Friezes of incised\ncounterchange joggling are also a common feature of Ottoman\nminarets in Jerusalem such as one at the Tomb of David, which\nis probably part of the conversion of that building into a\nmosque in 930/1524.\"°\n\nThere is some justification, therefore, to suppose that the\nshaft of the Bab al-Asbat Minaret may be an Ottoman\n reconstruction. The zone of transition shows, however, that if\nthe present shaft is not Mamluk then the one it replaces must\nhave been either circular or octagonal. Mujir al-Din, in an\napparent allusion to its different shape from the other (square\ntower) minarets, described it as the most graceful in form and\nbeautiful in appearance of the four minarets around the\nHaram.!!\n Notes\n\n1 CIA (Haram), 133-36.\n\n2 Mujir, 375, 380, 439, 608.\n\n3 Eg., CIA (Planches), \\xxi.\n\n4 The original stonework is shown in CIA (Planches), \\xxii.\n\n5 Layla ‘Ali Ibrahim, ‘The Transitional Zones of Domes in Cairene Architecture’,\nK des O, x, 1975, 15-20.\n6 CIA (Alep), pl. clvi.\n 7 Ibid., \\xviii, cxxv, cxlviii, cl, cli, clvi, clvii; E.

Over the left part runs an\nunusual cornice carved with a series of protruding muqamas\nelements; the right-hand part of the cornice is missing (plate\n 39.4). It returns a short distance southwards at the left-hand\nend. Since this return runs not at right-angles to the rest of the\ncornice but at an angle of about 110°, it seems likely that the\ncornice was originally intended for some other building.\nIndeed, the manner in which the ashlar portal is set into the\nrubble masonry of the street wall indicates that the whole\nportal was inserted into that earlier wall. This may have\noccurred when the shaykh’s house was formally established\nand endowed as a zawiya.\n\nFour steps now lead down to the threshold of the entrance\ndoorway at the back of the portal recess, suggesting that the\nstreet level has risen about a metre since the portal was built\n(see section, fig. 39.3). The monolithic lintel over the entrance\nis supported at each end on small shoulders carved with three\ntiers of muqarnas (plate 39.5). Stone benches flank either side\nof the recess.\n\nThe vault over the recess is curious (plate 39.4). It springs\nfrom three points: the front two springings are tucked in\nbehind the quirked ogee springers of the portal arch and the\nthird springing, decorated with fluting, is in the centre of the\nrear wall above the doorway. Although much obscured by\nsuccessive coats of plaster and paint, the triangular vaulting\npattern can still be discerned rising to a small hexagonal cupola\nat the crown (see plan, fig. 39.2).\n\nINTERIOR (figs. 39.2-39.4).\n\nThe very irregular arrangement of multifarious rooms varying\nin size and construction technique gives the impression that\nthe zawiya was established in an existing group of loosely\nrelated structures. The architectural detailing and the masonry\nof the walls is quite heterogeneous, and the floor levels vary\nconsiderably (see sections, figs. 39.3 and 39.4).\n\nOn the assumption that the entrance portal was added at\nabout the time when the zawiya was formally established\nbefore 770/1368, as seems likely, it is possible to assign other\nparts of the building to the same period on the basis of their\nsimilar masonries. While the bulk of the visible masonry is\nrubble, the vestibule, the staircase, the eastern part of the south\nwall of the courtyard and the splay-face cornice over the whole\nsouth wall are built of ashlars dressed in the same manner as\nthose of the portal, as delineated in fig. 39.4. The conjunctions\nbetween these areas of ashlar and rubble suggest that the\nrubble walling is earlier than the ashlar, as appears also to be\nthe case on the street frontage (above).\n\nOf the earlier structures two, the northern chamber on the\neast side and the southern chamber on the west side of the\ncourtyard, belong now to neighbouring houses. Another of the\nearlier structures, the western chamber on the south side of the\ncourtyard (marked ‘X’ on the plan), originally opened on it\nthrough an arch like a small zwdan (fig. 39.4). At least one of the\nvoussoirs of the arch must have been re-used since it alone has\nborder fillets in the quadrant chamfer moulding around the\nintrados of the arch. The rubble arch opening into the\nsplit-level chamber at the northern end of the west wall of\n side of entrance door\n\nthe courtyard is undecorated. At the back of this chamber is the\nsmaller of the two cenotaphs (plate 39.6).\n\nThe later ashlar masonry is more sophisticated. The\nstaircase, built across the front of an earlier room, has an arch\nunder it to maintain access to the room. This arch has an oddly-\nshaped head (fig. 39.3) decorated witha splay-face moulding in\na style strangely reminiscent of Crusader architecture.\nNonetheless, the quality of the carving is indifferent, just as one\nmight expect in this comparatively insignificant and\nimpecunious foundation of the eighth/fourteenth century.\n\nA symmetrical arrangement (plate 39.7, Jig. 39.4) of two\nrectangular windows flanking a horseshoe-arched recess\ncontains the doorway leading to two deep chambers at the\n south-east corner of the complex. Both chambers have a\nmibrab. The eastern one, divided by a fine timber screen of\nsome antiquity (plate 39.8) houses the larger of the two\ncenotaphs (plate 39.9). The present inhabitants of the\nBistamiyya claim that it marks the grave of Abii Yazid al-Bistami\nhimself, and that the smaller one in the north-western chamber\nis his wife’s. These attributions are of course apocryphal; Abu\nYazid is buried in Iran. Chances are that the graves belong to\nlater shaykhs of the zawiya buried according to custom in the\nlocal home of their order.\n\nSome modern alterations have been made: in the west\nroom on the south side and in the south room on the east side\nof the courtyard the vaulting has been hacked away, probably to\n raise the practical ceiling height; and the zwédn arch and the\narch under the stair have been largely built up to form\n\ndoorways more appropriate to the bedrooms which their\nassociated chambers have now become.\n Pa, Yer ne tenet\n\n1 Mujir, ii, 48,\n\n2 Sijill 57, 377 (3), and Sijill 58, 317 (3).\n\n3 Sijill 90, 294 (1), and Defter 522 (Ipsirli, 24).\n\n4 Facs. ofa survey of the city ‘... made in order to ascertain the names of streets,\nete. ..’, by Ch.

Although the\npresence of a different type of masonry in the lowest courses\ndoes not necessarily denote the remains of an earlier building\n(above, p. 439), there is reason to think that it does so here. The\neast wall which forms the street facade is unusually thick\n(1.54m) and its thickness seems to have been determined by\nthe previous existence of the three lowest courses; while\nconstruction of both the main entrance and the door to the\nsouthern vaults has clearly involved breaking through these\nlowest courses (plate 40.3). What that earlier structure might\nhave been is not known, though its eastern boundary appears\nto coincide with that of the present construction.\n\nAbove the earlier masonry the facade is composed of\nmuch smaller stones. The dressing of these stones is very\ndistinctive, each one having one or occasionally two panels of\npicked rustication bordered by a plain marginal draft (plate\n40.3). Around the window and door openings the masonry is\ndressed smoothly, which suggests either that the rusticated\nstones are in secondary use and the masons cut only the more\nelaborately shaped stones around the Openings or,\nalternatively, that the rusticated stones were dressed by one\ngroup of masons and the smooth stones around openings by\nanother. Similarly rusticated masonry found only 100m from\nthe Lu’lu’iyya in the chevet of a partly rebuilt church (plate\n40.4), possibly the twelfth-century Church of StJulian, confirms\nthat the rusticated masonry may be in secondary use. The same\nsort of rusticated masonry in the north wall of the nearly\ncontemporaneous Hanbaliyya Madrasa (781/1380) is used\nabove two courses of much larger stones, as at the Lu\'lu’iyya.\n\nA few odd pieces of this masonry are found in the interior\nof the Lu’lu’iyya in places that were originally plastered over.\nThis does not mean to say that there was a surplus of stones\navailable for re-use. Damaged or otherwise unsuitable stones,\neither newly-cut or re-used, could well have been deemed\ninappropriate for use on the facade and relegated to the\ngeneral construction of interior walls and vaults, There are,\nhowever, several stones without the distinctive rustication in\nthe upper part of the facade, which Suggests that the stones\n\nwere being re-used and that the supply had been exhausted by\nthat stage,!°\n Se alata ne cin tees Ee rahe ooh age eh tonne hem) fe meds\npoor quality masonry. This generally consists of roughly\nsquared stones laid in regular courses, originally all covered\nwith a coat of plaster. Openings are spanned by simple arches\nof crude workmanship or by thin lintels, most of which have\ncracked. Yet in places where the stonework was not plastered\nit is of a high quality. The quoins and frontal arches of the four\niwans are of well-cut ashlars as are two doorways in the passage\nbehind the south Zvdaz (below, p. 428). These doorways have\nflat, undercut relieving arches over their lintels similar to those\nover the windows in the facade.\n\n(ii) Compostion of the Facade (fig. 40.6, plates 40.2, 40.3 and\n40.5).\n\nThe tall and extensive street facade is imposing despite the\nsimplicity of its decoration and its partial obstruction by\nstrainer arches built in 1976 to resist an alarming outward lean\nthat the facade had developed, possibly as a result of the 1927\nearthquake. A continuous quirked ogee moulding separates\nthe ground floor from the upper floor. This moulding provides\na clue to the extent of the complex. At the north (right-hand)\nend of the facade it returns (plate 40.6) to include a small room\nspanning the street (marked ‘A’ on the upper floor plan, fig.\n40.5). At the south end it runs across the entrance to the vaults\nsouth of the madrasa and continues half-way across a buttress-\nlike tower built into the re-entrant angle of the street corner. A\nsimpler cavetto moulding forms a cornice over the upper\nstorey. This too extends half-way across the tower at the south\n\nMeith, east tae\n\n end but is now missing from the north end of the facade.\n\nThe composition of the facade is asymmetrical. At the left\n(south) end, adjacent to the corner tower, a doorway\nsurmounted by a window opens into the southern vaults. This\ndoorway has been altered relatively recently; its original form\nmay be seen in a photograph taken by Creswell in 1920 (plate\n40.3). Next is the main feature of the facade: the entrance portal.\nIt is a simple pointed-arched recess decorated with re-used\nmarble imposts (see above, p. 95) and a splay-face moulding\naround the extrados of the red and cream-coloured ablaq\nvoussoirs. At the rear of the recess the doorway, also built in\nablaq masonry, is surmounted in the tympanum of the arch by\na rectangular grilled window lighting a vestibule. Beyond the\nportal are two windows at different levels opening into the east\ntwan of the madrasa; the higher of these is now obstructed by\none of the modern arches. There is a third window, which\nOpens into a room in the north-east corner of the site.\n\nAbove the quirked ogee moulding the fenestration (plate\n40.5) reflects the disposition and importance of the first floor\nrooms. Above the portal and the door to the left are two pairs\nof rectangular mullioned windows each surmounted by a\ncircular oculus and, above that, a slit window (one of which is\nnow blocked); these all light an important reception hall that\nonce enjoyed a fine view to the east (plate 40.19). To the right\nare two single rectangular windows of diminishing size lighting\nrooms ‘B’ and ‘C’ (fig. 40.5).\n\n(iii) Ground floor\n\nThe modest pointed-arched entrance leads into a cross-vaulted\nvestibule. On the right (north) side of this there is a plain door\nleading into the east zwén of the madrasa, which comprised a\ncentral courtyard roofed by a folded cross-vault with an\noctagonal oculus at the crown. The west, north and east sides of\nthe courtyard are confronted by deep Zwdmns, but on the south\nside there is only a shallow recess, with no mibrab but a\ndoorway in the centre (plate 40.7). This door, as will appear\nfrom its description given below, was evidently the main\nentrance to the madrasa, rather than the door entering the east\niwan from the vestibule. Irregularly-shaped chambers fill the\nnorth-east and north-west corners between the other zwdmns.\n\nTo enter a madrasa through the gibla wall, dispensing with\na mibrab, was quite out of the ordinary, and is hard to explain\nexcept by exigencies of the site and the necessity of adapting\nthe accommodation to pre-existing structures. The gibla iwan,\nusually the deepest but here used simply for an entrance, was\ntoo shallow for assembly for tuition or prayers. Teaching must\nhave been conducted in one or more of the other three zwans.\n This can never have been very satisfactory since the whole\nmadrasa was lit and ventilated only by the roof light over the\ncentral courtyard and windows in the eastern 7wan. That iwan\nwas lit, before 1976, by two windows set at different levels in the\neast wall, the higher central, the lower toward the right (plate\n40.8). To the left, where for symmetry a third window might\nhave been expected, there is only a deep niche. If that was once\na window no trace of it remains in the outer face of the wall.\n\nReturning now to the vestibule we may explore the\nstructures which, on the south and west sides, restricted the\narea available to the planners of the madrasa.\n\nFacing the outer portal, the west wall of the vestibule has\nbeen radically altered in modern times. The present doorway\non the west side (plate 40.9) gives access through a short\npassage into a staircase leading up to the first floor. The\ndoorway is not original. The original doorway was in the right\nhalf of the wall, and its lintel is still in position. Except for a\nsmall window-like aperture, that has now been blocked up. It\ngave access to a barrel-vaulted passage along the south wall of\nthe madrasa. Half-way along the passage, on the right side, is the\nwell-built doorway (plate 40.10) which leads into the south\niwan of the madrasa. The carefully dressed and jointed jambs\nand lintel of this doorway (surmounted by a joggled keystone\nbetween two cantilever stones relieving the lintel) and the\ncavetto mouldings on either side show that it belongs to the\noriginal construction and was in fact the main entrance to the\nmadrasa.\n\n——\n The far end of the passage is partly obstructed by an\nobtrusive rubble shaft (plate 40.11) which connects an\nunderlying cistern to a well-head in the upper floor. The shaft\nis obviously a later insertion, possibly replacing an original\nwell-head at this level. Beyond it a doorway, (plate 40.11, fig.\n40.7) constructed of ashlar masonry with a flat relieving arch\nover the lintel like the main entrance to the madrasa, leads into\na vaulted chamber (now largely filled with debris) and on to an\nirregular arrangement of vaults and arches (plate 40.12). These\nappear to belong to an earlier structure. They extend along the\nwest side of the madrasa past an undecorated doorway into the\nwest iwan and on to a blocked opening which apparently led\nto a second staircase at the north-west corner of the site, giving\naccess to the upper floor. Subsequent alterations made in\nadapting the building to domestic use (see below) have\nobliterated all remains of the staircase, except that the vaulting\nof the passage rises eastwards towards the blocked Opening as\nif to roof such a staircase (plate 40.13) and the vaulting of the\nnorth-west corner room has been kept low as if to carry it. A\nstaircase in this position would have supplemented the main\nStaircase from the vestibule, permitting direct access from the\nmadrasa to the upper floor through the doorway in the west\niwan. In this way students could come and go between the\nschool and their lodgings on the upper floor, while the founder\nreached his private apartments by the main staircase.\n\n(wv) Mezzanine (fig. 40.4)\n\nThat main staircase serving the upper floor was formerly\nentered by an opening (which no longer exists) close to the\nnear (east) end of the passage, where its position is indicated by\na small transverse excision in the barrel vault over the bottom\nStair. It lay conveniently close to the main doorway into the\nmadrasa.\n\nThe staircase led up to a large landing now roofed with\nsteel beams and concrete — a late-nineteenth or twentieth-\ncentury technique.’ Presumably it was originally vaulted,\nthough the floor-to-floor height between the landing and the\ncourtyard above is only about 2.5m —a very shallow space in\nwhich to construct a traditional vault to span the 2.93 x 2.91m\nlanding.\n\nA simple doorway leads off the landing into a cross-vaulted\nchamber to the west. This chamber is said by local inhabitants\nto contain a tomb, but when the debris that filled it was cleared\nout in May 1983 no trace of a tomb was found.\n\nTo the east of the landing a very low and narrow L-shaped\nroom sits over the passageway below (shown in section, fig.\n40.7). The entrance to this room was presumably off the\n landing although there is no sign of a doorway there. Until it\nwas blocked in 1983 that room could be entered through a\nhigh-level opening in the rear wall of the gibla twain (see plate\n40.7). There was also a tiny window opening just under the\nvault of the vestibule (plate 40.9).\n\n(v) Upper floor (fig. 40.5)\n\nFrom the mezzanine landing a flight of eleven steps leads\nnorthwards to the main upper floor. Of the original\naccommodation on this level only the eastern range\noverlooking the street survives intact. The rooms on the north,\nwest and south sides all appear to have been rebuilt, though\ntheir arrangement around an open courtyard probably follows\nthe original layout. The octagonal oculus of the madrasa opens\nin an irregular masonry plinth (see figs. 40.5, 40.7 and 40.8) on\nthe east side of the courtyard, which is now filled with a jumble\nof concrete-block walls and shacks (plate 40.14).\n\nAt the north side of the courtyard there is nothing but the\nremains of the springing of a vault in the north-east corner to\nestablish the former existence of structures there.\n\nOf the rooms on the west side only the two southern ones\nappear possibly to be more or less original; the others have\nbeen largely rebuilt. The entrance to the southernmost room is\nsituated, like that of the western room of the south range, over\nthe staircase landing. The staircase itself arrives at the upper\ncourtyard beside the doorway of the central room on the west\nside. This room is now divided to form latrines and a corridor\nleading to a western courtyard surrounded by a further group\nof rooms, not included in the survey. The western courtyard\nand its associated rooms lie beyond the west boundary of the\nmadrasa on the ground floor but it is possible that they once\nserved as ancillary accommodation for the madrasa. They can\nbe reached now only by way of the main staircase. The\narchitectural style of these buildings is Ottoman but here too\nthere are signs of considerable rebuilding. In this western\ncourtyard there is another well-head, formed from a hollowed-\nout column base (plate 40.15), over a second cistern located\njust north of the deepest of the ‘southern vaults’.\n\nOn the south side of the principal courtyard there are two\ncross-vaulted chambers. The eastern one originally opened on\nthe courtyard as an iwéin. The springer and two voussoirs of the\nfrontal arch survive, along with traces of a splay-face moulding\naround its extrados at the south-east corner of the courtyard\n(plate 40.16).

The lowest steps are missing, as are others higher up\nwhere a new window has been opened (p/ate 40.17),\n\nThe east range consists of three handsome rooms and the\nsmall chamber (A) spanning the street. Whatever the Original\npurpose of this small chamber over the street was, it now serves\nas a bathroom. Windows with low sills in both north and south\nwalls (seen in section, fig. 40.6) allow full advantage to be taken\nof the lively views up and down the street, perhaps originally\nfrom behind mashrabiyya screens. Access to it is from the north\nroom of the east range. Built into the north wall of this room\nthere is a re-used stone decorated with a scallop shell motif\n(plate 40.18) reminiscent of the tiny squinches often used in\nAyyubid dome construction but here carved on a flat surface\nwith a ‘broken arch’ frame of the type often found in the rear\nwalls of water fountains. Its original purpose is unknown.\n\nThe central room of the east range, entered from the\noculus plinth, is set back from the line of the other rooms to\nallow clearance for the folded cross-vault of the madrasa, which\nrises higher than the other vaults. Its floor is at the same level\nas the others in the east range, requiring three steps down to it\nfrom the plinth. There is a door in the south-west corner,\nplaced so as to open on the centre of the adjoining room to the\nsouth. This latter room comprised two cross-vaulted bays each\nlit by a double window with central mullion. It was entered\nfrom the courtyard by a door on the axis of the northern bay;\nand the door (mentioned above) in the centre of the north wall\ngave access to the adjoining room. A modern partition now\ndivides the two halves of the room and has necessitated the\nopening of a new doorway to connect the southern half to the\ncourtyard.\n\nBy analogy with other roughly contemporaneous Mamlik\nfoundations like the Manjakiyya (above, pp. 384-398) and the\nTashtamuriyya (below, pp. 460-474) it seems likely that this east\nrange of rooms served as the residence of the founder, the\nAmir Lu’lu’ Ghazi. The double-bayed room with its anteroom\nto the north and its fine view of the Dome of the Rock (plate\n40.19) would have been an appropriate place for him to receive\nhis guests. As for the rest of the upper floor, it is now too much\naltered for it to be possible to deduce how it might have been\nused originally, whether for accommodating students and\nteachers attached to the madrasa or as part of the founder’s\nresidence or as a combination of hoth\n SOUTHERN VAULTS (Jig. 40.5)\n\n(i) Street vaults\n\nThe main series of vaults to the south of the madrasa extends\n25.5m westwards exactly on the alignment of the present street\nwhich leads eastwards from them to join the valley street, Tariq\nal-Wad, opposite the west entrance to the Siiq al-Qattanin (see\nlocation plan, fig. 40.1). At the west end of the last vault there is\nwhat appears to be an arched opening, now blocked ( plate\n40.20). If this series of vaults were to continue for a further 26m\nwestwards it would open into the Siig al-Khawajat, one of the\nparallel triple markets.’* It is conceivable therefore that these\nvaults are built on the line of some much earlier street whose\nexistence can be detected only in their alignment. Nothing can\nbe deduced from their construction since all are plastered.\n(ii) Vaulted chambers to the south\n\nA further two vaulted chambers to the south are entered from\n the first of the street vaults (plate 40.21). Both are solidly built\nwith squared masonry walls and rubble cross vaults; an ashlar\ntransverse arch separates the two vaults. Cutting across the\nnorth end of the more easterly of these chambers is a staircase\nleading up from the street to various dwellings to the south and\nwest of the Lu’lu’iyya, built partly over the ‘street vaults’. This\nstaircase was obviously built after the vault it cuts through. It\nwas probably built after the Lu’\'lu’iyya also, for at the upper level\nit runs against the wall of the room (D) in the upper floor of the\nmadrasa (plan, fig. 40.5).\n\nThe part these southern vaults played in the running of the\n baralietihe ffm re yet\n\n1 Mujfr, ii, 46-7.\n\n2 CIA (Ville), no. 42.\n\n3 Mujir, ii, 47.\n\n4 Defter 522 = Ipsirli, 36; Defter 602, 457.\n\n5 Mujir, loc. cit.\n\n6 Haram no. 162, dated Ramadan 795/July 1393, contains the testimony of a\nwoman from ‘Ajliin taken in the rab‘ of Lu’lu’, and Haram no. 747, dated Dht\'l-\nHijja 796/October 1394, has the testimony of a woman from Hama.\n\n7 Sijill 4, no. 4326.\n\n8 Sijill 92, 350 (1).\n\n9 Sijill 151, 368.\n\n10 Sijill 57, 349 (2).\n\n11 Sijill 57, 464 (8). ee\n\n12 To be precise, the phrase ‘their ancestor’ appears only in the authorisation to\nact as agent (tawkil), see note 10 above, where it may possibly be an error.

The upper courses of\nmasonry are more or less regular in height and contain several\nstones with one or occasionally two panels of picked\nrustication like those in the facade of the Lu’lu’iyya (above, p.\n426).

The chalky monolithic door lintel is now badly\neroded and appears to be on the brink of collapse. The load on\nit is relieved somewhat by a flat relieving arch of elaborately\njoggled red and black ablaq voussoirs.\n\nINTERIOR (plan, fig. 42.3)\n the diagonally opposite corner of the vestibule a door opens\ninto the central courtyard. The vestibule is thus arranged to\nform a bent entrance whereby the courtyard is practically\ninvisible from the street.\n\nA barrel-vaulted recess (A), 0.36m wider than the\nvestibule, opens north from it. Its arched opening is now partly\nblocked by a later wall (see plate 42.3). This recess, like other\nchambers in the northern part of the madrasa, has an angled\nback wall following the alignment of the street. Beside the\nentrance doorway, a door in the east wall of the vestibule (plate\n42.4), leads into a long corridor that runs south within the east\nboundary wall of the madrasa. It was (poorly) lit by a slit\nwindow (now blocked) in that east wall. In the south wall of the\nvestibule a door opens into a cell (B) on the east side of the\ncourtyard.\n\nThe courtyard, now cluttered with shanties (plate 42.11),\nis enclosed on the east, west and north sides by a series of cross-\nvaulted cells and by a cross-vaulted iwdn opening on the south\nside. The two cells (B and C) on the east side, each lit by a high-\nlevel slit window, have been conjoined by the removal of the\ncommon wall. In the process, the door of ‘B’ has been converted\ninto a window. On the west side of the courtyard four doors and\nfour high-level slit windows open into three cells (G-I) and a\nporch leading to the west annex (see below). Here also two\ncells (G and H) have been combined and the redundant door\n(of H) converted into a window. At the north end of the\ncourtyard are three doors surmounted by slit windows. The\ntwo eastern doors open into two cells (L and M), and the\nwestern one leads into a passageway giving access to two cells\nto the west (J and K) and a tiny cubicle to the north. The south\nwall of cell J) has been breached at some time to link that cell\nwith the adjoining cell (1) to the south.\n\nThe upper part of the courtyard walls has been rebuilt on\nall sides, where later structures have been added on the roofs\nof the cells. The only unencumbered roof is on the west side\nabove the porch and cell ‘G’. Here the masonry is intact and\nincludes a simple splay-face cornice which must originally have\ncontinued round the east, west and north sides.\n\nThe ivan at the south end of the courtyard rises about two\nmetres higher than the cells on either side. Its pointed frontal\narch springs from muqarnas imposts, carved slightly\ndifferently on either side (plates 42.5 and 42.6). The top of the\narch has been rebuilt with new voussoirs, but the lower part\nsurvives on both sides, where a bold quirked ogee moulding\nframes the extrados (see plate 42.7).\n The handsome miéhrab (plate 42.8) in the middle of the\nrear, gibla wall has been clumsily repaired and the fine details\nare obscured by several coats of paint. Nonetheless the original\nform remains discernible (fig. 42.4). A quirked ogee moulding\nframes a rectangular panel of red and cream-coloured ablaq\nmasonry containing the pointed-arched niche, which is flanked\nby nook-shafts with re-used Crusader bases and capitals. The\narch is built of ablaq voussoirs which extend inwards and\ndownwards to an arch-shaped hub at the centre of the conch.\nMuch of this stonework is now missing, and several voussoirs in\nthe arch have been replaced. The second course of stones\nabove the mibrdb is slightly recessed between elaborately\nmodelled terminals as if to receive an inscription that was never\ncarved . The upper part of the wall, above the frame moulding,\nhas been hewn away to provide a ledge where pigeons nest.\n\nIn the east wall of the zvdn two doors open into two small\ncells, one (E) barrel-vaulted and one (D) cross-vaulted like the\nothers. A recess in the east wall of ‘E’ opens into the corridor\nfrom the entrance vestibule. There are various irregularities in\nthe masonry at this end of the corridor which, though difficult\nto see clearly for piles of debris and old newspapers\n(containing nests of rats), do suggest that this opening is a later\nbreach. A change in the vaulting of the corridor (see plan, fig.\n42.3) seems to indicate that it originally extended only as far as\ncell ‘D’ where a door (now otherwise not identifiable) opened\nin the east wall of that cell. Why the builders should have\nprovided such an independent access to cell ‘D’ is not known:\nit is a very unusual feature.’\n\nOpposite the two doors in the east wall of the zvdn a door\nand a window open into a room (F) on the west side, which is\nroofed by two cross vaults. Above this room is an upper-floor\nchamber with a window opening under the vault of the ivan\n(see plate 42.9). This upper room, inaccessible to us, was\nreached from the west annex.\n\nThe cross-vaulted porch at the south-west corner of the\ncourtyard is entered by a plain door indistinguishable from\nthose of the cells. Inside, there is a door in its south wall to\nroom \'F’, At the west end the porch opens through a wide\narchway to a small yard around which the components of the\nwest annex are disposed. To the south a door and a window\nopen into a chamber (N) that we were unable to enter. To the\nwest two doors open into two small rooms (O and P). The first\nof these (O) was also inaccessible to us. The other (P) now\ncontains a privy. These two small rooms are situated under an\nopen stairway which rises against the north and west sides of\n the yard to give access to the roof of the madrasa and the upper\nfloor room on the west side of the zvdin.\n\nA modern doorway has been pierced in the yard’s north\nboundary wall, at the bottom of the stairway. This doorway\nleads into a larger yard, presumably a modern creation,\nenclosed by the west wall of the madrasa and by two free-\nstanding walls to the north and west. It is reached from the\nstreet by a modern door in the north wall. Another two modern\ndoorways, with slightly projecting stone frames similar in detail\nto the doorway at the foot of the stairs, have been made in the\n west wall of the madrasa to give independent access to cells ‘T\nand ‘kK’. These doorways will have been built relatively recently\nwhen the building was converted into three separate dwellings.\nTwo little marble basins beside the west wall of the main\ncourtyard of the madrasa (plate 42.10), both apparently part of\nthe original Mamlik fabric, may have drained water from the\nsurface of the courtyard into a cistern, from which water could\nbe drawn at a well-head at the base of the southern abutment of\nthe archway from the porch to the west annex. The present\nwell-head is modern but it probably replaces an earlier one.\n 1 Mujir, ii, 44.\n\n2 One such cubit (dhira‘ najjari) = 77.5cms , see Hinz, Islamische Masse, 60.\nOne carpenters’ cubit is one and a half normal ones (Ibn al-Athir, Kamil, Beirut\ned., xi, 457, s.4.575/1179).\n\n3 Sijills 30, 330-1, and 31, 48 and 386 (1).\n\n4 See note 1.\n\n5 Sulitk, iii, 360.\n\n6 Suliik, iii, 373 and 377.\n\n7 For his career, see Durar, ii, 46-7; Ibn al-Furat, ix, 4; Suliik,\nv, see index; Ibn Qadi Shuhba, i, 226-7.\n\n8 Two inscriptions survive which may be attributed to Baydamur, when\ngovernor of Damascus, one with certainty and one less so.

The only known teacher in the madrasa in the\nMamluk period was in fact a Shafi\'i (see above, p. 438). Indeed, Mujir al-Din,\nhimself a Hanbali, observes wistfully that there were no Hanbalis inJerusalem for\nmany years until a new Hanbali imam was appointed in 890/1485 (Mujrr, 384).\nHowever, he subsequently lists several notable representatives of Hanbalism in\nJerusalem in the eighth/fourteenth and nintl/fifteenth centuries (Mujir, 592-602).\n ','STREET FRONTAGES, ENTRANCE PORTAL, INTERIOR'),(43,'nan',NULL),(44,'HARAM FRONTAGE (fig. 44.3)\nAbout 7m south of Bab al-Nazir, in that part of the Haram wall\n\nwhich later formed the east boundary of the Wafa’iyya, al-\n‘Umari noted the window ofa hall that was a waqf of the Haram\n and at that time (c.745/1345) served as lodgings for the\nsuperintendent of the Haram awqaf.> This window still exists,\nthe northernmost of five plain windows Opening on the Haram\n\nfrom the Wafa’iyya. The southern four windows did not exist in\nal-‘Umari’s time.\n\nSTREET FRONTAGE (plate 44.1)\n\nThe street frontage is three storeys high. The two lower storeys\nbelong to the Wafa’iyya and the house associated with it; the top\nStorey is a later Ottoman addition (see plate 44.2). The\nconjunction between the frontage of the Wafa’iyya and that of\nRibat al-Mansiri to the west shows that the ribat is posterior.\nThe masonry of the Wafa’iyya frontage is not homogeneous and\nincludes some stones with distinctive Crusader tooling and a\nmason’s mark which appear to be in secondary use, indicating\n that the construction is probably post-Crusader, perhaps\nAyyubid. In the upper part of the wall four re-used stones bear\nfragments of two Arabic inscriptions dating from the fourth/\ntenth or fifth/eleventh century.\"\n\nThere are few openings in this frontage: two windows\nfitted with masbrabiyya screens in the upper storey (the left-\nhand one surmounted by a slit window) and a rectangular\ngrilled window and a pointed-arched door with a slit window\nabove it in the lower storey.\n\nINTERIOR (plan, fig. 44.3)\n\nThat door leads into a barrel-vaulted chamber which serves as\na vestibule from which two doors open, one east and one south.\nThe door to the east opens into another barrel-vaulted\nchamber, lit by the grilled window in the street frontage. From\n the south door a short passage to the east admits to the north-\nwest corner of a long hall extending eastwards in three vaulted\nbays up to the Haram wall, where it is lit by the window\nobserved by al-‘Umari. In the south side of the embrasure to\nthat window a deep recess in the thickness of the wall might\nonce have contained a staircase to the upper floor.\n\nThe western bay of the long hall opens southwards\nthrough a cross-vaulted extension into a small open courtyard,\nwhere a staircase against the west wall now serves the upper\nfloor. On the southern side of the yard an archway opens into\na barrel-vaulted room at the south-west corner of the zawiya.\nThe area to the west of these compartments is inaccessible\nsince four openings into it are blocked. To the east, between\nthese compartments forming the western and northern sides of\nthe zawiya and the Haram, the remainder of the ground floor\nconsists of six rooms in two parallel ranges. These rooms\nagainst the Haram wall are lit by windows which were not seen\nby al-‘Umari, suggesting that the rooms were constructed at\nsome time after 745/1345. The northernmost of these rooms\ncontains a large anonymous cenotaph. From the southernmost\npair of rooms two short passages lead south to two\ninterconnected barrel-vaulted chambers between these rooms\nand the northern chamber of the Ribat of Kurt (see above, p.\n148).

The\nnorthern recess now contains the lower part of the modern\nstaircase to the Manjakiyya (above, p. 387); the southern one is\npartly obstructed by a narrow stair built against the east wall to\nserve the Ottoman buildings on the top floor of the Wafa’iyya.\nThe original extent of this southern Zvdn (dotted on the plan)\nis shown by a straight joint visible in the east wall of the eastern\nroom confronting the street. A deep recess has been cut\nthrough the rear wall of the zvén, evidently to help light the\nlong hall of the zawiya.\n\nThe date of construction of the porch is not known, though\nits semicircular frontal arch suggests that it is early.\nConjunctions in the masonry of the street frontage show that it\ncertainly predates all parts of the Wafa’iyya, and there are\nindications that the gate itself is Umayyad for, though its arched\nopening was rebuilt in about 600/1204\"* and an inner porch\nadded in 707/1307-8, traces remain of the springings of an\nearlier semicircular arch that matches other Haram gates for\nwhich an Umayyad date of construction has been postulated\n(above, p. 45).

The waqf documents would also\nhave specified the particular use of the various rooms to the\neast of the turba and on its roof, together with the original ways\nof communication, of which much has necessarily been altered\nin the six centuries since Tashtamur’s death.\n\nThe structural fabric of the building and its decoration tell\nof various compromises due to the limitations of either space\nor finance, and one might add the pressure of time. For this is\nwhat the combined literary and epigraphical evidence\nsuggests: if it was some time in Ramadan 784 that Tashtamur\nhad asked to be excused from his office and allowed to reside\nin Jerusalem (possibly after Barqiq’s accession on the 19th),\nand ifthe year 784 given in the inscription refers, as usual, to the\ndate of completion at least of the bulk of the structure, then\nthere could have been only three full months for its\nconstruction. Apart from architectural evidence this time factor\nis taken here as an additional argument for considering the\neastern parts of the complex (at the frontage and the rear) as\nlargely pre-existing. In other words, upon arrival in Jerusalem\nTashtamur would have acquired a building or two along this\nprominent road, and will have only demolished and rebuilt as\nmuch as was needed for the planned mausoleum-madrasa unit\nand an appropriate entrance, making use also of existing\nboundary walls; the other (eastern) parts were simply taken\nover and made into a coherent residential area. Considering\nthat from the demolition much of the building material was\nreadily available on site, and considering the long tradition of\nthe local masons in building with stones of all sizes and\nhistorical periods, there is every reason to accept that within\nthe three months Tashtamur’s makdn was largely completed,\nincluding his reception hall or gaa on the vault across the\nstreet.\n\nThere is, moreover, additional architectural evidence to\nthe effect that the monumental portal unit was installed\nprefabricated, which would naturally have contributed\nlikewise to the speeding up of construction works. This\nevidence mav he concidered firct\n PORTAL\n\nIt can be seen that the muqarnas portal was designed\nindependently of the rest of the layout, since it necessitated\nvarious adjustments in the plan and elevation of the\nsurrounding structure. Had it been sited on the exact centre-\nline of the frontage, like the axis of the vestibule (plan, fig. 45.3),\nits frame moulding would have impinged on the width of the\nadjacent shop recess (elevation, fig. 45.7, left). The portal itself\ncould not, of course, be made narrower, since its width was\nlinked to the geometry of the muqarnas (as shown in AG.\nWalls’ analysis, fig. 45.12D) and to the width of the cantilevered\nashlar stones from which that was carved (fig. 45.12A). The\nwhole had therefore to be shifted in the other direction\n(westwards) (plan, fig. 45.3), making the right jamb of the door,\nat the centre of the recess, come flush with the vestibule wall\ninside. Any further shift would have made the door too narrow\nand would have impinged on the springing of the terminal arch\nof the street vault (fig. 45.12A).\n\nEven so further adjustments were necessary on the left\nside of the portal (elevation, fig. 45.7) where the springer of the\nstreet vault had to be moved to the left, thus reducing the bay\nover the westernmost shop recess and causing the window of\nthe room above to be recentred. It is also worth noticing that\nthe frontal stones of the two upper tiers of the mugarnas hood\nhave been smoothed into a curve producing a trefoil outline\ntogether with the frontal arch of the semidome above. One may\nwonder why this decorative effect was left without the usual\nemphasis of a moulding. This, together with the excessive\nwidth of the portal, or its hood, not anticipated in the layout\nplan, raises the question whether this portal may not originally\nhave been made for another building, whether or not actually\n installed there. In other words, had it been dismantled from\nsome other site or had it been acquired ready-made from a\nbuilder’s yard? Considering Tashtamur’s eagerness to\ncomplete the building with its foundation inscription before\nthe end of his year of arrival, either possibility would have\nspeeded up the work. The slight off-centredness of this\nprincipal entrance is, however, of no consequence visually,\nsince there is no overall decorative scheme for the facade, still\nless a symmetrical one as in the Turba Kilaniyya obliquely\nacross the road.\n\nMAUSOLEUM\nThe mausoleum, the most important building unit of the\nwhole, was of course placed on the best part of the frontage, in\nthe higher west wing, which is also at the juncture of two urban\nthoroughfares. The size of the tomb chamber is somewhat\nlarger than any other built on this street or elsewhere in\nJerusalem in Mamltk times. Made as large as possible in the\nspace available, it takes up almost the whole width of that wing,\nexcept for a narrow strip bordering the Maydan Lane (plan, fig.\n45.3). It is approximately square and is expanded on each side\ninto a high pointed-arched recess. The transition to the dome is\neffected by means of two-faced pendentives spaced out to\nsupport a twelve-sided string course and drum (plate 45.8 and\nsection, fig. 45.8); these show the remains of pairs of shallow\nmugqarnas elements applied to the obtuse corners of that\ndodecagonal course.*’ The dome rising from the drum has its\nbase marked by a rounded-off string course; it is in profile\nslightly stilted and thus distinguished from the domes of purely\nlocal tradition which are generally more squat.\n\nThere is a mibrab, soberly cut in large ashlar blocks in the\n south (qibla) wall (plate 45.7), to stress, as customary, that\nalthough a memorial to a person, it was above all a place for the\nworship of God — for orthodox Islam has always denounced\nsuch commemoration as concealed idolatry. It is set between\ntwo recesses of which the left (eastern) one was originally a\nwindow opening to the madrasa, and so providing a physical\nlink with those pious studies of religious sciences of which the\nfounder, in establishing and endowing his tomb, has assured\nthe perpetual performance. Such architectural openings,\ngenerally found in tomb chambers of the time, are an\nindication of the ardent medieval belief in, and aspiration for,\nthat ‘baraka’ or beneficent divine influence, spiritual but felt\nalso as substantial, which emanated from acts of piety. And\nsince that was derived also from the blessings invoked by\npassers-by on the tomb, those who, like Tashtamur, could\nafford it would buy sites on prominent streets, where the\nstream of passers-by was dense and continuous. Hence the\ngreat popularity of this section of Tariq Bab al-Silsila as a site for\nfunerary monuments, even more so than sites along the\nborders of the Haram, which was closed at night; and hence the\ninvariable practice of providing a tomb chamber with at least\none, preferably (as in Tashtamur’s), with two large grilled\nwindows opening on the street.\n\nThe sills of these windows are flush with the floor inside\n and as broad as the dome-bearing wall they were set in. Here\ngenerally took place the supreme and most obvious of the acts\nof piety from which ‘baraka’ was derived — readings by\nprofessional readers of the Koran. It was certainly to honour\ntheir worshipful task of spreading the word of God (for the\nbenefit of both those buried within and those passing outside)\nthat these window sills were especially enhanced with\ndecoration: here a patterned pavement of marble mosaic (in\nblack, two shades of brown, and white). The place is marked off\nfrom the rest of the room by its own raised sill, composed of\ntwo pieces of white marble with a reddish piece of marble\ndovetailed in (note the trefoil shape of the joints in plate 45.12).\n\nThe tomb chamber is that part of the complex on which\nmost of the decorative effort was spent, within the means at\nTashtamur’s disposal. Thus its entrance was especially\nembellished outside and inside: in the vestibule, the door\njambs were constructed in bichrome courses, the flat relieving\narch above the lintel given a curvilinear joggled inlay (now\npainted over), and the whole was surrounded by a rectangular\nframe moulding which ends on both sides ina curl (plate 45.9).\nThere is a bronze door knocker (plate 45.10). This entrance to\nthe mausoleum in the west wall of the vestibule was further\nemphasized by a folded cross vault in the tunnel vault of the\nvestibule (plan, fig. 45.3). Within, the arched recess of the door\n MAaMLUR JCTUSALETL\n\nis capped by a radiating motive carved from stucco rather than\nstone (plate 45.11).\n\nExternally, in the principal facade (elevation, fig. 45.7), the\ntwin mausoleum windows are spanned by massive monolith\nlintels, and their jambs are of course constructed in that\nubiquitous ablag device for emphasizing and_ attracting\nattention. The whole is set in a tall moulded frame which\ncontains the foundation inscription with it own eye-catching\nborders of joggled crenellated motifs in strongly contrasting\nablagq effect — there was no space to make a complete frame\n(plate 45.3, note how the particular disposition of the white\nmarble components, pointing up and down, seems, however,\nto frame the inscription).\n\nThe text of the inscription was kept to the bare essential\nand, what is quite extraordinary, the basmallab was omitted. To\njudge from Max van Berchem’s epigraphic survey, there is no\nother case of such an omission in the foundation inscriptions of\nJerusalem. Here the reason must have been the lack of space,\nfor it had obviously been Tashtamur’s wish to endow his turba\nwith both the popular charities of a sabil providing water and\na kuttab for the care of orphans, and room had to be found for\nboth of them customarily at the frontage of the building. A\nglance at the elevation drawing (fig. 45.7) will show that it was\nparticularly the accommodation of the alcove on brackets —\nwhich is here called a kuttab — that has restricted the decorative\nframe around the mausoleum windows and hence the extent of\nthe inscription band within.\n\nOne may wonder what has prevented the calligrapher\nfrom condensing the ¢hzluth-type lettering further for the\ninclusion of the four words of the basmallab. But then, he had\nalready condensed it notably by superimposing letters by three\nand in one place by four; going any further would probably\nhave been against the rules he was working to in a one-line\ninscription, which is quite adequate and well balanced as it is.\nWhether or not the omission of the basmallah was in the enda\ncompromise due to calligraphic aesthetics, the limitation of the\nfacade decoration of the mausoleum was above all an\narchitectural compromise, and one that actually also concealed\nthe spaciousness of the mausoleum interior.\n\nSABIL-KUTTAB\n\nThe interpretation of the rather curious architectural\narrangement at the north-western corner of the mausoleum\nsuggests itself by a comparison with what was built in Cairo at\nthe time. It happened precisely during the years when\nTashtamur was Grand Dawadar there that a combination of a\nsabil room with a kuttab directly above was first built, and that\nin such a particular siting, namely at the corner of the mosque-\nmadrasa-mausoleum complex of the Grand Amir Yljay al-\nYusufi who had married the Sultan’s mother.*® It was an\nimprovement on the allocation of separate places to them, as in\n the madrasa-mausoleum complex which Sha‘ban had built for\nhis mother a few years earlier.” This novel arrangement, which\nhereafter became the standard formula for sabil-kuttdbs in\nMamltk Cairo, will surely have been a matter of discussion\namong the amirs, and favouring it Tashtamur will have\nexplained it to the local builders of his Jerusalem makdn. They\ndid their best to comply, displaying considerable inventiveness\nin producing space for each of them at the north-west corner of\nthe mausoleum (which alone in the complex was directly\nexposed to two thoroughfares) taking advantage of the massive\nwalls meeting there (plans, figs. 45.3 and 45.4; section, fig.\n45.11).\n\nAs for the working of the sabi/, there is a well-head in the\ncorner of the tomb chamber, above a cistern from where the\nwater was drawn (plan, fig. 45.3; section, fig. 45.8); and there is\na raised niche ‘s’ beside it in the wall adjacent to the recess ‘cl’\noutside, which has its own raised niche in the rear. The two\nniches are separated only by a very thin wall and water will have\nbeen poured down from the higher one (s) into the lower one\n(cl) for dispensing in the street.\n\nAs for the accommodation of the kuttdb ‘c2’ (plan, fig.\n45.4) it is likewise effected largely within the thickness of the\ncorner walls, but it is also half-projected from the facade on\nattractively carved cantilevered corbels (plate 45.1), whereby\nthe room inside becomes ¢c.2m square. There is an extension to\nit in the upper rear (‘c3’, fig. 45.11) reached by a ladder;\nalthough not high enough for an adult to stand in, it was\nperhaps used for storage of books, and probably also as a\nretreat for the teacher. Access to the Ruttdb is via stairs within\nthe western boundary wall of the mausoleum, now entered\nonly from the side of the tomb chamber; however, originally\nthere will also have been the usual access for the children from\noutside, through a now walled-up door (to ‘c2’) in the Maydan\nLane (fig. 45.11).\n\nMADRASA\nAdjacent to the mausoleum in the rear of the site is the large\nfour-iwan hall ‘b’ that represents the core of the madrasa. Its\nprincipal axis, on which lies the deeper gibla iwan in the south,\nis sited roughly central between its eastern and western\nboundary walls, each of which contain parts of older structures\n(cf., e.g., the unnecessarily massive eastern boundary wall in\nwhich recesses are hollowed out from both sides: plan, fig. 45.3\nand section, fig. 45.10 where remains of an older arch are seen).\nThere is a certain decorative emphasis given to the gibla\nwan in that a triple-arched window” was installed under its\nvault (plate 45.13) above the place of the mihrab, which van\nBerchem has seen, but of which no traces remain. However, as\nusual in this fashionable iwvdn-scheme for creating a\nmonumental interior (largely independent of boundary walls),\nall decorative means are gathered around the central rectangle\n\ni Ri ac Dea TIR an mtb\n\n — here a perfect square — between the four frontal arches of the\niwans. Apart from a subtle ornament applied to both the\nspringers of the arch of the gibla iwan no directional emphasis\nis given, except towards the centre, where the volume of the\nroom is increased by sinking the court and raising the vaulting\nsystem in relation to the level and vaults of the zwéns. At the\nborders of the sunk court the kerb stones are decoratively\njoggled in two contrasting colours, and a shallow octagonal\nbasin of marble is placed centrally under the octagonal skylight\n(section, fig. 45.10) forming the centre of a patterned\npavement.\n\nThe four-iwan hall is the largest interior space in this\ncomplex and much levelling has been done in the sloping\nconditions of the site. It is interesting to note, though, that only\none of the four corner spaces of this hall shares its level, i.e., that\nin the south-east (both those in the west are higher,” like the\nascending Maydan Lane outside, and that in the north-east is\nnotably lower). One may wonder what was the reference point\nfor the level adopted for this hall, since it had obviously not\nbeen easy to establish even for that of the south-east corner\nroom ‘b1’, because of the fabric of the ancient wall on which\nthis room was built (cf. elevation, fig. 45.9 and plate 45.5). As the\nsurvey drawings have made the levels readily appreciable, this\notherwise hidden effort of the builders may be briefly noted in\na separate paragraph.\n\nLEVELS\n\nThe general level of the madrasa iwéins is found to correspond\nexactly to that adopted for the sill under the mzqarnas hood of\nthe principal entrance (part section, fig. 45.12B). This\nimportant portal sill, in its turn, seems to have been positioned\nwith reference to the highest point in the street-level at the\n Se Ss AORN CAT EVA\n\nfacade, which is at the north-west corner (elevation, fig. 45.7);\nhence it came to be placed rather high in the middle of the\nfacade, requiring four steps, of which three were set in front of\nthe building in the street (elevation, fig. 45.7; in greater detail:\nfig. 45.12 A, B and C where the semicircular shape of the\nsuccessively narrowing steps is shown).\n\nThere remained, however, a slight practical problem as\nregards the access to the mausoleum, for the floor of the tomb\nchamber, raised above the burial vault, was considerably\nhigher than the level of both the portal and the madrasa (for the\nmadrasa-mausoleum relationship, see section, fig. 45.10). It\nwas cleverly solved by building up the vestibule by one step for\nits entire length. Two further steps were needed; one was made\nthe doorstep of the mausoleum entrance and the other —a final\nhigh step up — was placed at the inner face of that door, as seen\nin the east-west section, fig. 45.8.\n\nCommunication between the new turba unit and the\nsimply appropriated older parts in the east was limited in the\nground-floor to the ‘sunk’ corner room between the north and\neast zwans. Here internal stairs (of four to five steps) will once\nhave given access to both the ablution place in the well-room\n‘el’ and the latrine ‘L’ (plan, fig. 45.3, the short passage leading\nto the latter is seen slightly obstructed in plate 45.15 by the\nsubstructure of the stairs to the middle floor; for its stucco half-\ndome, see plate 45.14).\n\nIn thus relating the level of the madrasa hall to that of the\nprincipal portal a certain median level was established for\ncommunication between the mausoleum, in the highest part of\nthe frontage, and the dependencies of the madrasa, of which\nthe ablution place ‘e1’ in the east is level with that of the lowest\nshop in the frontage (section, fig. 45.9); this room (e1), though,\ndoes not necessarily date from the same time. Whatever its\nearlier date, the fact that its centrally placed window in the\nsouth wall was half obstructed when the adjacent corner of the\nmadrasa was built (for the oblique opening thus formed, see\nplan, fig. 45.3 and elevation, fig. 45.9) is sufficient to show that\nit was an older structure annexed by Tashtamutr’s builders.\n\nRESIDENTIAL QUARTERS\n\nSome living accommodation was already available in the\nmarket unit with its three rzbi‘rooms. No longer used in their\noriginal function as commercial letting, these rooms have lost\ntheir separate access as well as their uniform size (cf. the layout\nof the rubit ‘rooms in the Siig al-Qattanin, fig. 24.3). At least one\nimportant modification surely dates from Tashtamur’s time: the\nextension of the westernmost room on this level into the\nmasonry behind the apex of the mugarnas hood (plan, fig.\n45.4); the floor level of that extension corresponding neatly\nwith the top of the upper mugarnas course was apparently\nbuilt simultaneously with the installation of that portal\ndecoration (section, fig. 45.12B). Another modification was that\nthe usual open-air landing at the rwbit‘ level was partially\ncovered by the stairs leading up to the g@ a or reception hall on\nthe roof court (fig. 45.9), with a small cross-vaulted room\nadded at the middle floor landing of these stairs (section, fig.\n45.8; plan, fig. 45.4).\n\nTwo further, larger, rooms (e2* and e2°) were gained for\nliving accommodation on this middle floor when the tall\neastern corner rooms of the ivan hall were subdivided by a\nnew floor (plan, fig. 45.4). Both were made accessible from\noutside the madrasa, using the existing long well-room ‘el’ as\na kind of stepping stone, as seen in fig. 45.9 for the north-\neastern room ‘e2””,\n\nIn the other upper corner room in the south-east, ‘e2*’,\nwhere contact with the well-room below was less direct, four\nsteps were accommodated within a bent passage cut through\nthe thickness of an abutting wall (plan, fig. 45.4), a fifth\nattractively decorated with a row of mugarnas elements being\nset in front of it (section, fig. 45.9). The room ‘e2’ was built as a\nkind of ante-chamber from where one ascends to ‘e2” which\nwas in all probability the Amir’s personal abode, being not only\nthe largest room on this level, but also the only one there\n enjoying an unobstructed view onto the Haram; moreover, its\nwindow is the only one on this side to be decoratively\nemphasized from outside, as seen in plate 45.5. Considering\nTashtamur’s reputation as seeking to learn and understand the\nlaws of the religion he adopted, it is not improbable that he had\nasked his builders to provide a direct access from this place to\nthe madrasa room below (cf. the beginning of a small stairway\nwithin the thickness of the south wall in room ‘b1’, (fig. 45.3);\nno traces of its issue are now seen above).\n\nThere is a single room ‘e3’ above the ante-chamber which\nbelongs to this residential setting and has the benefit of an\nadditional window in the east wall towards the Haram (see\nLevant, xi, fig. 9); it is also embellished internally by a large\nfluted cap in the apex of its vaulting (section, fig. 45.9) and may\n well have been built for Tashtamur’s son Ibrahim, who died\nnine years after his father and was buried in his turba,\naccording to the only funerary inscription that exists there.”\nThe northern part of this residential middle floor may, in\ncontrast, have been more specifically for the women of the\nAmir’s household, which would explain the installation of pairs\nof massive consoles under the 7zbi “type windows at the street\n(not found in the Stq al-Qattanin mb‘) for carrying\nmashrabiyyas.\n\nA Mamlik amir’s residence would not be complete\nwithout a g@a or reception hall of some architectural\ndistinction, and that it was sited here on the vault across the\nprominent Tariq Bab al-Silsila made it duly important. Its\nextent was, of course, limited there by the domed tomb\n chamber in the western wing, but the maximum was achieved,\nas can be seen in the elevation fig. 45.7. Internally the\nfashionable four-iwan scheme was applied to give it a focal\npoint, of course, only two iwéns could be developed to a\ncertain depth, the other two being reduced to shallow arched\nrecesses not even marked like the others bya slight elevation in\ntheir level (section, fig. 45.7). The usual folded vaulting system,\nterminating in a shallow fluted cap, was adopted to enhance the\ncentral square, but it was here made only slightly higher than\nthe cross vaults of the zvans.\n\nOn the opposite (south) side of the large roof court (the\nrooms marked ‘Q’ in the drawings which subdivide it now are\nmodern), a shallow external iwém, facing north (plate 45.16),\ngives access to the only other decoratively vaulted room on this\nlevel — naturally the one in the south-east with the view onto the\nHaram (g) (plan, fig. 45.5). The vaulting system over its square\npart (section, fig. 45.9) is basically the same as in the q@4, or in\nany other area of consequence apart from the mausoleum, i.e.\nthe madrasa hall, the entrance to the mausoleum and the third\nfloor room ‘e3’ of the annex. This room ‘g’ was in fact built\nencroaching on the roof of the annex room ‘e3’ (plan, fig. 45.5).\nA repaired earthquake rift in the south wall (see Levant, xi, pl.\nxxxva) indicates that much of this room, including its vaulting\nsystem may be a reconstruction. Perhaps it was in connection\nwith such a rebuilding that its only window came to be placed\noff-centred, both inside (plan, fig. 45.5) and outside in relation\nto the other windows below (plate 45.5).\n\nThere is a small arched doorway, now walled up, in the\neast wall of the courtyard in front of this room (plate 45.16),\nwhose external frame is seen in elevation in fig. 45.9. It was\noriginally reached from the landing in front of the third floor\nannex room ‘e3’ — probably by wooden stairs. Thus all three\nresidential rooms of the south-east corner (e2*, e3 and g) with\na view onto the Haram were put into communication. This\ntogether with their more pronounced decoration, either inside\nor outside, is architectural evidence suggesting that the gaa\nmay here have been a mere traditional requisite of an amiral\nresidence, whereas the real focal point of Tashtamur’s life in his\nJerusalem makén was in sight of the holy precinct.\n SUVEVU\n\n* This assessment of the building, first published in 1979 and 1980 (Levant, xi, pp.\n138-61, and xii, p. 163) is largely based on the extensive survey material\nestablished between 1971 and 1973 by A.G. Walls. His drawings —8 horizontal and\n14 vertical sections — were reduced in number for that publication and\nrecomposed. This was done in 1978 by R. Kent who redrew and ina few instances\nrevised the material (without, however, taking into account the structural changes\neffected in 1976 in connection with the redevelopment of the Old Jewish\nQuarter). Some of these drawings are published here. I have rewritten that article\nand adapted it to the subheadings devised for this book. Several people have\nadvised me on the wording of the text; special thanks are due to Dr Terence Walz\nand, above all, to Robert Hamilton who, in addition, has recast and condensed the\nsections on the portal and the mausoleum.

The variety of masonry types\nand course heights indicates that the lower part of the wall has\nbeen rebuilt in places, possibly more than once. The masonry\nof the upper part of the wall is more or less uniform except at\nthe right-hand (southern) end where it has been rebuilt in\nrecent years. Modern strainer arches span the street to buttress\nthe frontage.\n\nThe fenestration comprises three small rectangular\nwindows at the upper level and two grilled windows opening\non the tomb chamber at the lower level. The iron grille of the\nright-hand lower window is typically Mamlik with spherical\nbosses at the intersections but it was obviously intended for a\ntaller opening (see plate 46.1), perhaps an earlier window\nreplaced by the present one. The grille of the left-hand window\n\nis altogether cruder and both it and its window must be later\ninsertions.\n The main feature of the frontage is a recessed entrance\nportal (plate 46.2) to the right of these windows. The ashlar\nmasonry of the portal is quite different from that of the rest of\nthe frontage and it looks as if the portal was made elsewhere\nand then inserted into an existing wall. The same phenomenon\noccurs at another zawiya, the Bistamiyya (above, p. 421), and we\nspeculate that the portal might have been added to the Shaykh’s\nhouse when it was formally established and endowed as a\nzawiya.\n\nThe shallow (0.40m deep) portal recess is spanned by a\npointed horseshoe arch, the keystone of which is undercut to\ngive a very tentative ogee profile to the arch. A splay-face\nmoulding frames the portal, rising vertically on either side and\ncontinuing horizontally across the top. Directly above the\nkeystone of the arch the moulding bends upwards to form a\nminiature ogee arch. At the bottom of the vertical runs of the\nmoulding two curious stone bosses sprout inwards from it.\nBoth the ogee arch form and these sprouting bosses are\nextremely unusual.\n\nThe entrance door is flanked by low stone benches, and\nhas jambs of red and cream-coloured ablaq. The lintel is badly\nweathered and cracked but traces of a carved border\ndecoration are still recognizable (plate 46.2). Above the lintel\nis a course of simply joggled voussoirs with a more elaborate\none in the middle. The voussoirs appear to be laid upside-\ndown, emphasizing the non-structural nature of the decoration\nand also suggesting that the portal was erected by relatively\n unskilled or inexperienced workmen. A small rectangular\nwindow pierces the tympanum of the arch.\n\nTo the right (south) of the portal a water trough is built\ninto the street frontage (see plate 46.3).\n\nINTERIOR (plan, fig. 46.2)\n\nThe entrance opens directly into the long main hall, which is\nroofed in three bays by cross vaults springing from responds in\nthe side walls. In the south wall of the eastern bay is a plain\nmibrab. A door in the south wall of the western bay opens at the\nfoot ofan open stairway which rises against the outer face of the\nsouth wall to the upper floor. This will be the ‘stairway near the\nentrance’ mentioned in the report of 1066/1656 cited above. A\ndoor in the south wall of the central bay of the hall opens under\nthis stairway; it has no reveals and appears to be a later\ninsertion.\n\nIn the north wall of the western bay, behind a modern\npartition wall, a door and a window open to the cross-vaulted\ntomb chamber. A modern gabled timber cenotaph draped with\nbaize marks a grave in the south-east corner of the chamber. Mr\nYusuf Natsheh, Director of the Islamic Archaeology\nDepartment of the Awgaf Administration, kindly informs us that\na stone trapdoor in the floor under the cenotaph opens to a\nshort flight of steps down to a burial vault closed by double\nstone doors. This vault presumably contains the remains of\nShaykh Muhammad and his descendants (see above).\n 1 Mujjir, ii, 161 and 47.\n\n2 For the vocalisation, see CIA (Ville), 126, note 8.\n\n3 Mujir, ii, 160-1; Ibn Qadi Shuhba, i, 203; Durar, iii, 425-6.

(The left-hand [easternmost] portal,\nwith a trefoil head, shown in fig. 48.6, belongs to the imdra of\nKhassaki Sultan, built next to the palace in the middle of the\ntenth/sixteenth century; see above.) The east and west\nentrances are blocked, the masonry of the east portal has\ndeteriorated quite badly in places, and an extra storey has been\nbuilt in modern times over the right-hand (western) part of the\nfacade, but this detracts little from its original impressiveness.\nOf the three, the east portal is the most elaborate. Its deep\n(2.06m) recess, built of red and cream-coloured ablaq\nmasonry, has a border of red stones enclosed by parallel\nquirked ogee mouldings (plate 48.1). A string course of ablaq\njoggling runs around the recess above the door lintel. This\njoggling is of natural limestone inlaid with black stone that has\nweathered to a grey colour here and elsewhere on the facade.\nFour tiers of muqarnas ‘stalactites’ support a slightly pointed\narch of red, black and cream-coloured voussoirs and a\nsemidome decorated with four drop-shaped inserts of black\nstone weathered to grey. In the rear wall of the recess a circular\noculus, now blocked, is framed by a panel of limestone\nelaborately carved to take an inlay of black stone, red glass\npaste, green glass and possibly turquoise faience.\'? Almost all\nof the inlay is now missing. Ambiguous dovelike terminals in\nthe four corners (plate 48.2) have drilled ‘eyes’ and carved\n‘beaks’ to heighten their (presumably adventitious) avian form.\n The central portal (plate 48.3) is the smallest and least\nimposing of the three, though it encloses the widest doorway.\nIt comprises a shallow (1.01m deep) recess spanned by an\nunusual cinqfoil arch, the top lobe of which is in the form of a\ntiny cloister vault (plate 48.3). The arch and the upper part of\nthe rear wall of the recess are built of red, black and cream-\ncoloured ablaq, but the joggled voussoirs of an oculus and\nstring course above the door are of black stone and plain\nlimestone painted red to simulate ablaq. More traces of red\npaint survive on alternate courses of the jambs. Moulded\ncorbels support each end of the lintel so as to reduce the span\nover this doorway, which at 2.22m is the widest of the three. It\nis the principal entrance to the main hall and is designed to\npermit easy access: the usual stone benches on either side of\nthe recess are absent, and the corners of both the recess and the\ndoorway are chamfered to reduce abrasion.\n\nThe west portal (plate 48.4), 1.56m deep, is somewhat less\nimposing than the east one but is also finely decorated and\nimpressively tall. Its red and cream-coloured ablaq stonework\nis enclosed within a quirked ogee frame moulding which\nextends in a double profile around the extrados of the pointed\nhorseshoe arch over the recess. The two mouldings are linked\ndirectly at the springing level and indirectly by a single loop\nabove the keystone. Four steps flanked by stone benches lead\nup to the door. Immediately above the lintel a string course of\njoggled ablag identical with that of the east portal runs around\nthe recess. At a higher level above the door there is a\nrectangular window with an inlaid star-pattern border. The\ninlay, where it survives intact, consists of pieces of reddish\nstone, grey-black stone and turquoise faience. An inscription,\nextending across the full width of the portal, rises up around\nthe window to frame it and its decorative border. The\ninscription contains no historical information, only the\nbasmala and verses 46-55 of siira xv of the Koran.\'®\n\nThe large circular window (diameter of opening: 1.31m)\nbetween the central and west doorways lights the main hall. It\nis surrounded by a double quirked ogee moulding enclosing\nfour concentric rings of low-relief chevrons, two carved on the\nouter wall face of the voussoirs and two on the splayed intrados\n(plate 48.6).\n\nThe fenestration of the upper floor rooms and the\nstaircases is unremarkable: rectangular windows with, above\nthe three in the middle of the facade (see fig. 48.6), undercut\nrelieving blocks and slit windows (two of which are now\nblocked) The four rectanoular and two = round-headed\n windows at second-storey level over the right-hand part of the\nfacade belong to the later additions mentioned above.\n\nThe storerooms in the western annex to the right of the\nwest portal appear to have been built at the same time as the\npalace for the following reasons: (1) the masonry, though it\ndoes not course through with that of the palace, is similar to it\nin colour and texture; (2) the design of the flat relieving arches\nover the door and window lintels — two cantilevered stones\nwith a simply joggled keystone between — is similar to that\nfound in several parts of the palace, such as above the service\nstair window on the facade and above the doorway into the roof\nstaircase; (3) the design of the chamfered corners at either end\nof the annex’s street frontage, with a pyramidal base and a\nmuqarnas head (see plate 48.7), is typically Mamluk; (4) there\nis no opening in the west wall of the west vestibule of the\npalace, suggesting that the storerooms were expected to abut\non that wall; (5) if the annex was not built at the same time as\nthe palace then the west end of the palace’s facade would have\nbeen delimited by the west portal’s frame moulding, an\nexceedingly awkward and unlikely procedure for Mamlik\nbuilders whose normal practice was to extend the masonry\nsome distance beyond the frame moulding before turning the\ncorner, as happens at the east portal.\n\nThe stonework of the annex’s upper facade is smaller and\nless finely dressed than that of the lower storey and appears to\nbe later work. It is contained between two towers of earlier\nmasonry, part of the same construction as the lower storey,\nwhich rise almost to the full height of both storeys at either end\nof the facade. The decorated chamfers (mentioned at (3)\nabove) are carved into this earlier masonry. Thus some\nstructure, contemporaneous with the storerooms below, must\nonce have extended between these corners. Later, possibly\nduring an earthquake, the structure, except for the more\nresistant corners, collapsed and was replaced by the present\nhouse.\n\nGROUND FLOOR (plan, fig. 48.3)\n\nEntered through the central doorway, the main hall (36m long\nand 11.5m wide) occupies the major part of the ground floor\n(plate 48.8). It is roofed by a series of ten cross:-vaults\nsupported on a central row of four square pillars, with two\nbarrel-vaulted bays at the south end. Transverse arches span\nbetween the vaults, each springing from similar impost blocks\ncarved with a pair of mugarnas elements (fig. 48.18).\n\nAs the natural contours of the site rise towards the south-\nwest, so the floor level of the hall rises in the same direction\n(sections, figs. 48.9 and 48.12). At the south-west corner of the\nhall the bedrock has been cut away to extend the uniform floor\nsurface; the line of the rock is clearly visible protruding above\nthe floor here (plate 48.9). Above the bedrock in the south-\nwestern bay a platform, 1.32m high, leads to a second arched\nopening in the south wall.\n\nThe alignment of the south wall is quite different from that\nof any other in the vicinity; it corresponds only to the natural\nrock contours. Just as the principal north-south axis of the hall\nruns not at right-angles to the street frontage but at an angle of\n83° to it (plan, fig. 48.3), so the south wall was built on its\npresent alignment presumably for the same reason: to\nminimize tedious levelling of rock outcrops in the south-\nwestern part of the site. A later portico (plate 48.10), almost\ncertainly part of the caravanserai built by Khassaki Sultan in the\nmiddle of the tenth/sixteenth century (above, p. 486), abuts on\nthe outer face of the south wall.\n\nSeveral chambers open to west and east off the main hall.\nOf the three on the west side, only the central one is now\naccessible (plan, fig. 48.3). The doorways into the other two are\nblocked and only a general impression of their size can be\ngained by peering through a high-level window in the east wall\nof the southern chamber or down a well-shaft into the northern\nchamber, which has been converted into a cistern (section, fig.\n48.7). This latter chamber is said by Orphanage officials to\ncontain a mibrab. The central chamber is long and narrow,\n running more or less parallel to the street rather than at right-\nangles to the hall, apparently here too in an effort to skirt the\nrising rock surface. A recessed well-head in the south wall\nopens into a cistern cut in the bedrock.\n\nA window and four doors open in the east wall of the hall.\nThe wide, pointed-arched window at the north end of the wall\nopens into the east entrance vestibule. Its sill is at the level of\nthe floor of the hall, which is 0.86m higher than that of the\nvestibule. To the right of that window two rectangular\ndoorways give access to two cross-vaulted rooms, the first of\nwhich is aligned like the vestibule at right angles to the facade\nand the second is aligned more or less parallel with the hall.\nThese doorways may be later insertions for they are not well\nmade and in each of them a short flight of steps leading down\nfrom the hall looks like an afterthought. The blocked doorway\nbetween the two rooms is equally crude and may also be a later\ninsertion. Doorways in the east walls, now blocked, are\nprobably the original means of access. A doorway in the south\nwall of the second chamber, possibly in its original place\nthough much modified in recent years, has steps leading up to\na high zwan-like vault. In the west wall of this zvdn a pointed-\narched doorway into the main hall, similar in construction to\nthe vestibule window at the north end of this wall, is obviously\noriginal. The zvam opens south on a small courtyard. (An\n opening in the west wall of the courtyard, connecting it with the\nmain hall, is plainly a later insertion.) A tunnel-vaulted passage\nimmediately east of the zvdn connected the courtyard with the\neastern yard (p. 485) which is now enclosed by later buildings\nbelonging to Khassaki Sultan’s ‘imdira (above, p. 487). From the\nsouth side of the courtyard a window, apparently replacing an\nearlier door, opens into a series of three vaults which now\nhouse the Orphanage kitchens. The southernmost of these\nvaults (plan, fig. 48.3; section, fig. 48.12) is clearly a later\naddition but the others may originally have existed alongside\nthe palace even though no clearcut structural connection exists\nbetween them and the rest of the palace. In any case\nconsiderable alterations have been made here and it is\nimpossible to be sure what does and what does not belong to\nthe original construction.\n\nFrom the street, the west entrance leads into an entrance\nvestibule aligned at right angles to the facade. Square in plan\nwith pointed-arched recesses in its west and south sides, it is\nroofed by a shallow saucer dome supported on triple-faceted\npendentives (plate 48.11); a more conventional high dome\nwould have intruded into the room above (section, fig. 48.7). In\nthe east wall there are two doorways (see section, fig. 48.7). The\nlarger, on the right, opens on a small landing at the foot of a\nwide staircase (1.36m) leading up to the first floor of the\nbuilding. This is the only main access to that floor. The east-\nfacing archivolt of that doorway is decorated in an unusual\nmanner: its voussoirs are extended downwards at an angle of\n10° to the vertical to form a tympanum, the underside of which\nis the intrados of the segmental rear vault of the doorway (plate\n48.12). The smaller left-hand doorway opens into an irregular\nchamber which once housed a staircase. The staircase has now\n entirely disappeared except for a high level window, which lit\nit from the street, and a blocked Opening in the wall opposite,\nwhere it ascended southwards to the upper floor (fig. 48.3).\nThe sill of that opening is at the precise level (2.85m) above the\npresent floor which the stair, as reconstructed in Jig. 48.17,\nwould have reached at that point. There are further traces of\nthis stair, which we shall call the ‘service Stair’, at upper floor\nlevel (p. 493). In the south wall of the vestibule there is a\nblocked opening’” into the chamber,!8 now a cistern, to the\nwest of the main hall, described above, p. 488. Although the\nbottom of the Opening is hidden behind an accumulation of\nrubble on the floor of the vestibule, it may have been a door\ninto a staircase down to the floor of the adjoining chamber,\nwhich is two metres lower than the vestibule. That chamber\nand the vestibule with the stairs between them could provide\nthe only direct link between the main hall and the upper floor.\nThe east entrance, the grandest of the three, leads directly\ninto a small vestibule, Square in plan, with a beautifully\nconstructed ashlar folded cross vault. At the crown the vault\nculminates in an octagonal cupola filled with an intricate\n eseeenpagee en SNES pe ye Cok eA I ee eee es NIE BAD SEL ULL VV ALE OER VV CHO,\nas to open on the facade beyond the frame moulding of the\nportal (fig. 48.6). Abutting on the internal lintel of the window\nis a half arch intended to support a staircase. The blocked\nentrance (1.02m wide) to this staircase faces the doorway into\nthe chamber.\n\nMEZZANINE (fig. 48.4)\n\nThe staircase from the east vestibule led up to a mezzanine\nconsisting of a landing and three rooms directly over the gound\nfloor vestibule and the series of rooms to the south of it. This\nStaircase may still exist but it is wholly inaccessible; in the very\nlimited space available it can only rise in the manner shown in\nfig. 48.16 with about seventeen steps including three winders\non each of three right-angled turns up to a landing alongside a\ndoor into the northernmost of the mezzanine’s three folded-\ncross-vaulted rooms. The bulk of the staircase was built into a\npointed-arched recess, the upper voussoirs of which project\nabove the landing (plate 48.15).\n\nBeyond the landing a balcony (plate 48.16) to the south\noverlooks the east yard. (A blocked doorway on the east side of\nthe balcony is a later addition intended to connect the balcony\nwith a room over the entrance to the imdra of Khassaki\nSultan.) It is possible that some sort of verandah, perhaps\nconstructed of timber, once extended between the balcony and\nthe roof of the tunnel-vaulted passage 9.5m directly to the south\n(see ground floor plan, fig. 48.3). A raised pavement in the east\nyard follows exactly this line. Otherwise no trace of a verandah\nsurvives except for a ledge between 0.05m and 0.11m wide\nalong the east wall of the palace, which might just have carried\nthe ends of floor joists, and a curious blind arcade above (plate\n48.17) which might have supported a lean-to roof. Such a\nverandah could have provided the central and southern rooms\nof the mezzanine with individual access through the doors in\ntheir east walls, though breaks in the masonry coursing at the\nbottom of the jambs of these doors may indicate that originally\nthey were windows with higher sills.\n\nThe three rooms of the mezzanine are now\ninterconnected by doors in the common walls. The central and\nsouthern rooms have tall windows opening to the west that\nhelp to light the main hall. The northern room, over the east\nentrance vestibule, has a circular oculus, now blocked, which\nopened in the centre of the decorated panel in the rear wall of\nthe east entrance portal.\n\nThe southern room of the mezzanine backs on the rear\nwall of the ivan mentioned on p. 489 above, the vault of which\n(seen in section on fig. 48.10) rises nearly to the full height of\nthe mezzanine rooms. Since the original staircase is blocked,\nthe mezzanine is now reached by way of a modern stair leading\nup to a cantilevered reinforced concrete walkway (plate 48.17)\nto the southern room.\n\nUPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 48.5)\n\nThere is no sign of the mezzanine’s staircase having continued\nto the upper floor. The main staircase to the upper floor was\nfrom the west entrance vestibule, described above. This\nstaircase emerges under a round-headed arched recess at the\nwest end of a rectangular courtyard, which provided the main\n access to ali the first foor apartments and to their roof. The\nshape of the arch over the recess suggests that it has been\nrebuilt but we may presume that it replaces a similar recess\nwhich originally sheltered the head of the main staircase.\n\nThe service stair from the west entrance to the upper floor,\nwhich may have been intended to allow a guard to move freely\nbetween the floors without resorting to the main staircase,\nemerged in an alcove (plate 48.18) in the room at the north-\nwest corner of the courtyard (fig. 48.5). This may have been a\nguardroom. It has a large window in its north wall opening\nunder the arch of the west portal, and a short passage leading\neast through a plain door into the courtyard.\n\nBeside that door an ornamental pointed-arched recess\n(plate 48.20) at the west end of the north wall of the courtyard\ndistinguishes the entrance to the original staircase to the roof.\nThe entrance opens into a short passage leading up by four\nsteps to a landing — now accommodating a latrine — from where\na further flight of steps (now blocked and plastered over) led\noff westwards before turning south to continue over the vault of\nthe service stair and on to the roof. This flight of steps was\noriginally lit from the street by a small window directly above\nthat of the service stair (shown in elevation, fig. 48.6). The\nwindow now lights a second latrine, built on the line of the\nformer staircase, and reached by a later stairway at the west end\nof the courtyard. That later stairway partly blocks the arched\nrecess at the head of the main staircase. It rises to a half-landing\nwhere it turns west through a round-headed doorway before\n turning south to an opening on the roof, now blocked by the\nlater addition of an extra storey. A modern reinforced concrete\nextension has been made to the stairway to serve that extra\nstorey.\n\nIrregular masonry in the upper walls reveals that some\nalterations have been made on at least three sides of the\ncourtyard.’ Only the east wall retains a moulded cornice — now\nsurmounted by a later parapet (plate 48.21) — which probably\ncontinued round all four sides. But since the courtyard paving\nappears to be largely undamaged except at the west end (plate\n48.21), it may be assumed that the alterations were generally of\na relatively minor nature: repairs rather than renovation.\n\nPassages lead off from all four corners of the courtyard.\nThe one at the north-west corner leads to the guardroom,\ndescribed above. The one at the south-west corner runs past a\ndoor (now blocked) into a barrel-vaulted room to the south\nand on behind the west wall of that room to a small recess\ncontaining what appears to bea shaft to allow water to be drawn\nup from the well-head in the room below. (The passage is now\nused as a store and is so filled with multifarious objects that a\ncomplete inspection was not possible.) At the east end of the\ncourtyard there are another two passages. The northern one\ngives access to the easternmost of the rooms ranged along the\nnorth side of the courtyard and continues southwards to open\non the roof of the mezzanine staircase. The southern one has a\ndoor in its south wall opening into a room in the south-eastern\ncorner of the courtyard. A modern doorway has been opened\nin the west wall of this room to connect it to a cross-vaulted\nroom, now fitted with ten shower baths, which was originally\nentered from the courtyard.\n\nThe solitary room at the east end of the courtyard, now\nused as a laundry, is well sited — with flanking passages to\npermit a healthy flow of air on all sides — originally to have\nhoused the latrines. The nearby room in the south-eastern\ncorner of the courtyard still contains four stone basins (plate\n48.22) which may well have belonged to the original bath-\nhouse. A drain uncovered beside the east entrance portal (plate\n48.25, fig. 48.6) in 1982 when a new sewer was being laid under\nthe street is in an appropriate place to have served both latrines\nand bath-house in such a location.\n\nIn the centre of the courtyard’s south wall another passage\nleads to the salient feature of the palace, the great reception hall\nconsisting of a central sunken court with axial zwvdns opening\nfor almost its entire width to east and west (plate 48.23). Folded\ncross-vaults over the west Zwvdn and the central court rise to\noctagonal oculi, the one over the court being splendidly\n decorated with three tiers of stone mugarnas (plate 48.24),\nOriginally both were probably sheltered by raised lantern\ndomes to admit light and fresh air but exclude the wind, rain\nand snow of a severe Jerusalem winter. The folded cross-vault\nover the east zwdn has no oculus but a shallow circular\ndepression at the crown, which appears to be the result of later\nreplastering. In this zvdn, however, which is well lit by three\nlarge rectangular windows in the east wall, the original vault\nmay never have had an oculus. Of the three windows, the\ncentral one has a semicircular light above its lintel and a\ncircular oculus above that (fig. 48.8). These windows look out\non a glorious view over the valley to the Dome of the Rock.\n\nTo the south of the reception hall is a group of eight\nancillary rooms, of which the four that are contiguous with the\nhall appear to be original. Those further to the south extend\nbeyond the south wall of the ground floor and are partly\nsupported by the Ottoman portico (p. 488, plate 48.10). They\nmust therefore be later additions. Since the alignment of the\npresent south wall at this level coincides with that of the\nOttoman portico it is probable that the two are\ncontemporaneous. All internal walls have a thick coating of\nplaster concealing what evidence there may be in the\nstonework of the line of the original southern boundary, which\nseems not to have coincided with the immensely thick wall at\nthe south end of the main hall on the ground floor. A suggestion\nfor the original layout is shown in fig. 48.14.\n\nWESTERN ANNEX (plans, figs. 48.3 and 48.5).\n\nOnly the two easternmost storerooms on the ground floor of\nthe annex were accessible to us. Both are entered from the\nstreet. They are barrel-vaulted and extend southward evidently\nas far as was possible without resorting to extensive excavation\nof the bedrock. Since the bedrock rises in a south-westerly\ndirection, the eastern storeroom extends the further back of\nthe two.\n\nAt the west end of the annex, at the corner of a blind alley\nleading off to the south, the lowest courses of masonry” appear\nto be vestiges of an earlier building which previously occupied\nthis corner (plate 48.7). Considerably more of the same\nmasonry forms the corner at the other side of the alley,\nsuggesting that the alley itself was already there in earlier times.\nThe main street, ‘Aqabat al-Takiyya, runs east towards Bab al-\nNazir, one of the Haram gates, on the line of a street that almost\ncertainly dates back to Roman times.\n\nThe present house on top of the storerooms is a later\nconstruction (see p. 488). It has a modest entrance portal (plate\n48.7) opening in the lane mentioned above. Its construction\nand decoration is analogous to that of others belonging to the\nlate-sixteenth or seventeenth century.\n\nThe western annex may have provided additional storage\nspace and lodgings for staff attached to the palace. Alternatively\nit might have been rented out to produce extra funds for the\nrunning of the palace or for the upkeep of the charitable\nfoundation connected to the princess’s tomb (see no. 49).\n\nINTERPRETATION\n\nIn its heyday the palace of Sitt Tunshuq must have been a\nsumptuous residence, the only one of its kind in Jerusalem. In\naddition to the main hall occupying most of the ground floor\nand the reception hall and courtyard on the upper floor, it\ncomprised no less than twenty-five rooms and four staircases.\n\nWithout access to the endowment deeds mentioned above\n(p. 485) any attempt to assess the original purpose and use of\nthe various components of the building must rely on\ninterpretation of the architectural fabric, a process complicated\nby various repairs and alterations.\n\nThe principal components are nonetheless clearly\nidentifiable. The main hall on the ground floor is the nucleus of\nan tstabl, a standard feature of palace architecture where horses\nwere stabled and groomed.”! The various chambers around the\nhall would have accommodated the stable’s appurtenances:\n located in the mezzanine) and so on. The open yards to the east\nand south were presumably paddocks where the horses could\nbe exercised. A plentiful supply of water was an essential\nrequirement and though the present fountain in the east yard\nappears to be Ottoman, it may replace an earlier source of\nwater at this spot. Otherwise the only alternative water supply\nwas the rock-cut cistern in the central chamber on the west side\nof the main hall.\n\nThe great reception hall on the upper floor is a gaa\nconsisting of a central sunken court (durqd a) with axial ivans\nopening to east and west off it. A gd is a typical feature of\nMamluk palace architecture and several other examples\nsurvive in Cairo.” But whereas the qa as in Cairo usually had\ntimber roofs, the durqd‘a and iwdns here have folded cross\nvaults.\n\nThe only access to the whole complex seems to have been\nfrom the street by way of the three entrance portals. The varying\nsizes and degrees of ornamentation of these portals appear not\nto reflect the hierarchy of functions they serve.\n\nThe central portal presents no particular problems of\ninterpretation: it is designed to allow the easy movement of\n\n animals and supplies to and from the stables. On the other\nhand, the west portal which is the main entrance to the piano\nnobile is somewhat suprisingly not the most elaborately\ndecorated. That distinction belongs to the east portal which, in\nterms of its function, seems to be the least important for it gives\naccess merely to the mezzanine and the east yard. There are,\nhowever, two factors that may explain its special emphasis: it is\nthe first of the entrances to be reached by people coming from\nthe Haram, and it is directly opposite the tomb of the founder,\nwhich has a similar panel of inlaid strapwork over its entrance\n(plate 49.1) as if visually to associate the two foundations. The\nwest portal, the main entrance to the palace proper on the\nupper floor, boasts the only inscription, part of the Koranic\nstra ‘A\\-Hijra’, somehow appropriate for the palace ofa refugee\nfrom Timir’s onslaught:\n\n... We shall strip away all rancour that is in their breasts;\nas brothers they shall be upon couches set face to face; no\nfatigue there shall strike them, neither shall they ever be\ndriven forth from there. . . .\n Notes\n\n1 Mujir, ii, 54.\n\n2 Mujir, ii, 65.\n\n3, See CIA (Ville), nos. 94 and 94 bis.\n4 Muir, ii, 64-5.\n\n5 Haram no. 246.\n\n6 St. H.

Access to the doorway, the\nthreshhold of which is about 7.50m above the surface of the\nHaram, was by way of a portico below the facade which\nextended west from the Is‘ardiyya. Mujir al-Din states that this\nportico was built at the same time as the Subaybiyya.’* Only the\nright-hand (east) abutment of the portico survives against the\nlast pier of the portico under the Is‘ardiyya (see plate 51.1). Part\nof the Ottoman barracks was built above the Haram facade in\nthe nineteenth century. When the barracks was demolished in\n1923-24 to make way for a new school (see above, p. 207) the\nwindow over the door was dismantled.\n\nThe masonry of the facade is pink and cream-coloured\nablaq. The lintels of the left-hand window and of the door are\nof mottled red granite. The lintel of the right-hand window\n(now missing) was presumably of the same material. At either\nend of the door lintel are two blocks of limestone into which\nhave been carved similar composite blazons enclosed by lobed\nmedallions (plate 51.2). The left-hand medallion has twenty-\nfour lobes, the right-hand one has forty. The blazon consists of\na three-fielded shield: upper field blank; on the middle field a\ncup charged with a napkin displayed on the middle field of a\nthree-fielded shield; on the lower field a cup.\n\nSTREET PORTAL\n\nAbout 40m to the north of the Haram facade stand the remains\nof a monumental entrance portal on the south side of the street,\nTariq al-Saray al-Qadim (plate 51.3). A line drawn through the\nmiddle of the door in the Haram facade drawn perpendicular\nto that fagade would, if produced northwards, pass almost\nexactly through the middle of the portal in the street. The two\ndoorways appear to be at roughly the same level. This suggests\nthat the street portal belongs to the Subaybiyya. Since both\ndoors are blocked and the interior quite inaccessible there is\nno way of confirming the suggestion, but in this context it is\nworth recalling that Mujir al-Din includes the Subaybiyya in his\nlist of buildings that could be entered from inside and outside\nthe Haram.\"\n\nOnly the right-hand (west) side and the base of the east\nside of the street portal survive. Certain features of the\ndecoration — pink and cream-coloured ablaq, a joggled string\ncourse, the disposition of a quirked ogee moulding which\nforms a rectangular frame for the portal as well as extending\nround the extrados of its pointed arch (see reconstruction fig.\n51.2) — are characteristically Mamluk in style. These features\nwere rarely used together before the end of the eighth/\nfourteenth century (the closest parallel is the west door of the\npalace of Sitt Tunshuq, see above, p. 487), which tends to\nconfirm that this portal may have belonged to the Subaybiyya.\n\nOne stone in the right-hand jamb of the portal is incised\nwith two curious marks (plate 51.4) the significance of which\nremains to be established.\n ','HARAM FACADE, STREET PORTAL'),(52,'The minaret rises directly from the left-hand (east) side of the\nentrance to the Khangah. Column drums built into the bottom\ncourse of the base strengthen the footing.\n\nThe shaft (see plate 52.1) is quite symmetrical, being\ndecorated similarly on all four faces. The base storey is plain. A\ncyma recta moulding separates it from the second storey, which\nhas a slit window surmounted by a roundel in each face. The\nroundels are composed of six skew-faceted voussoirs carved\nwith a zigzag —a distinctive feature found also at the Jami‘ ‘Umar\nMinaret (no. 50) and at the Jawhariyya (no. 58) — and\nsurrounded by a billet moulding. A piece of broken glazed\npottery has been used to fill the roundels on the north, south\nand east sides (see plate 52.2). These potsherds, different in\neach roundel, would repay further investigation.\n The second storey is divided from the third by a cavetto\nmoulding with a repeating muqarnas motif (plate 52.2). The\nthird storey is pierced by paired slit windows each with a little\narched head cut in the common lintel, which is supported by a\ncentral column. A billet moulding divides the third storey from\nthe fourth, which is quite plain save for three corbels on each\nside carrying the muezzin’s gallery. The gallery surrounds an\neight-sided chamber and is sheltered by a modern corrugated\niron canopy. The lantern above is capped by a circular drum\nand plain ashlar dome. Recesses flanked by engaged columns\nand spanned by pointed arches of gadrooned voussoirs open in\nall eight sides of the lantern. A continuous splay-face moulding\nframes the extrados of the arches. The recesses on the cardinal\naxes contain openings: small windows in the north, west and\nsouth sides, and a larger window or door in the east side (see\nplate 52.3).\n 1 See CIA (Ville), 87-88 and references cited there.\n\n2 Mujir, 512.\n\n3 The portal appears to belong to Saladin’s conversion of the building in 585/\n1189 — MAE, ii, 162 n. 1; M.H.

The ground floor fagade survives largely\nintact, but most of the upper floor facade has gone.\n\nOver the years the ground level of the Haram has risen,\nconcealing the bottom of the facade. A pit was dug against the\nfacade in 1979 to reveal a stone pavement in front of the\nbuilding, 0.70m below the present ground level (plate 54.2).\n\nFrom Mujir al-Din’s description (above, p. 105) we know\nthat the Ghadiriyya extended eastward from the Karimiyya.\nImmediately to the east of the Karimiyya is a curious half arch,\nnow blocked, followed by a small portico of four bays. To the\neast of the easternmost bay of the portico there is a plain door\ninto the chamber marked ‘A’ on the plan (fig. 54.3).\n\nNext to that chamber the right-hand part of the facade\nprojects 3.43m further into the Haram to align with the face of\nthe earlier portico to the east.

Each of the\nwindows is surmounted by a pseudo-relieving arch with\nrebated joints around the voussoirs, above which are pointed\nslit windows (the upper part of the left-hand one is missing and\nthe lower part blocked). Between the two right-hand ones is a\n AL-Ghddiriyya\n\nsomewhat larger window with an unusual trilobed head. A\ndiaperwork moulding extends across the facade above these\nwindows to abut on the haunch of the earlier portico to the east.\nThe western part of this moulding is missing. It can be assumed\nto have run across the full width of the salient part of the facade.\nTraces of a simpler cavetto moulding run ata lower level across\nthe facade of the portico to the west.\n\nAbove the diaperwork moulding the lower part of the\neastern end of the upper floor facade survives. At a point\nroughly above the trilobed window a vertical break in the\nmasonry may indicate the position of a jamb of a window in that\nfacade, though the masonry to the left of the break is very\nsimilar to that on the right and the whole upper facade is too\nincomplete to allow any firm conclusion to be drawn about its\noriginal appearance. Elsewhere the masonry of the upper floor\nfacade (including a re-used volute finial, see plate 54.3) is\nclearly a later rebuilding except at its west end where some of\nthe original masonry survives. In that surviving masonry a\nshallow recess with a sloping sill is spanned by three tiers of\nmugqarnas corbelling (plate 54.4). This recess contains a\nwindow, now blocked.\n\nThe entrance portal is set back 0.06m in the salient facade.\nIt is built of a red and cream-coloured ablaq enclosed by\nquirked ogee frame moulding that accommodates the set-back.\nThe entrance door is in the rear of a slightly pointed horseshoe-\narched recess. Several voussoirs and the keystone of the arch\nare composite; that is, composed of two stones. The coursing of\nthe ablaq masonry in the spandrels is adjusted to align with\nindividual voussoirs at the extrados of the arch, a technique\nobserved previously at the Khatiniyya (no. 31) and the\nArghiiniyya (no. 32). On either side of the doorway are the\ncustomary stone benches. Traces of the defaced foundation\ninscription are barely discernible on the door lintel, which\ncarries a pseudo-relieving arch composed of rebated voussoirs\nlike those over the windows. A rectangular window opens in\nthe tympanum of the arch.\n\nGROUND FLOOR (plan, fig. 54.3)\n\nThe blocked half-arch at the west end of the building opened\ninto a passage that led north to the area beyond the Haram wall.\nThe four bays of the portico are roofed by cross vaults\nseparated by transverse arches. A door (now blocked) in the\nnorth wall of the portico once led to structures that no longer\nsurvive beyond the Haram wall (see below). The door at the\neast end of the portico gives access to the small cross-vaulted\nchamber, ‘A’.\n\nThe main ground floor rooms occupy the wider, eastern\npart of the building. Here the plan is dominated by three\nsubstantial masonry piers, the south faces of which are on the\nsame alignment as the facade of the portico to the west. To the\nsouth of the piers stand three barrel-vaulted rooms (B-D) and\na cross-vaulted vestibule. To the north of the piers a barrel-\nvaulted passageway (plate 54.5) runs along the northern\nboundary wall. The reasons for this extraordinary layout are\nnot apparent; presumably the piers and their interconnecting\narches were intended to support some structure on the upper\nfloor, which no longer survives (see below).\n\nBecause of the rise in the level of the Haram surface, three\nsteps now lead down to the threshold of the entrance doorway,\nwhich leads directly into the vestibule. The splayed embrasure\nof the window above the doorway is skewed so as to open\nexternally in the centre of the tympanum of the portal and\ninternally more or less in the centre of the vestibule’s south\nwall (plate 54.6). The vestibule opens north under the arch\nspanning between the middle and west piers. A doorway (plate\n54.8) beside the west pier opens south into room ‘B’, lit by a\nwindow in the Haram facade. There is a cupboard-like recess in\nits east wall. From the space between the east and middle piers\ntwo doors give access to the two eastern rooms (C and D), lit by\nwindows in the Haram facade. Room ‘C’ has cupboards in its\neast and west walls. The door into room ‘D’ turns through 90°\nto open in the west wall of the room. An unusual feature of\n these doorways into rooms ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ is their arches, which\nare semicircular and not pointed as was usual in the Mamlik\nperiod. A second, wider door leads into room ‘D’ from the\nnorth at the east end of the passageway. At the west end of the\npassageway a hole roughly 0.60m in diameter has recently been\nopened into chamber ‘A’ but there is no sign of an earlier\nopening. Chamber ‘A’ must have been reached only by way of\nthe door in the Haram facade.\n\nThe lighting of the passageway is complicated. There are\nno windows in the north wall. Some light is borrowed from\nroom ‘C’ through a high-level window in its north wall (plate\n54.7) and additional light percolates in from the trilobed\nwindow in the facade through a long tunnel that runs through\nthe upper part of the wall between rooms ‘C’ and ‘D’ (see\nsection, fig. 54.6).\n\nUPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 54.4)\nA staircase in the west pier (plate 54.8) leadine to the ween.\n floor is now blocked. It obviously led west to the upper floor\nwhere, evidently, the major part of the Ghadiriyya stood. Today\nonly the blocked window at the west end of the facade and\nremains of a folded cross vault beside that window bear witness\nto the earlier structure (see plate 54.10). Since folded cross\nvaults are almost invariably square in plan, we can reconstruct\nthe original shape of the room (marked ‘E’ on the plan) roofed\nby that vault as shown dotted on fig. 54.4. The reconstruction\nshows that the room extended about 1.50m further north than\nthe present north boundary wall. That this was indeed the case\nis confirmed by early photographs (such as plate 54.9). These\nphotographs, taken before the Birkat Bani Isra’1l was filled in,\nreveal that the lower part of the Haram’s north wall is much\nthicker than the upper part and that a series of arches were built\non top of the lower part of the wall to support an extension of\nthe western wing of the Ghadiriyya out over the pool. The exact\nlayout of that extension is not entirely clear, but the\nphotographs show that to the east of room ‘E’ a second staircase\n led down to various structures to the north of the portico. It\nmust have been to these structures that the door in the north\nwall of the portico gave access. None of them survives. Nor do\nany of the upper floor structures such as those mentioned in\nthe contract dated 964/1557 (see above). At the east end of the\n upper floor a parapet wall separates the Ghadiriyya from the\nroof of the adjoining portico where the Tiliiniyya Madrasa\n(built before 800/1398) once stood. That madrasa, as Muir al-\nDin records, was reached from the stairs of the Bab al-Asbat\nMinaret.”\n s£yVeryo\n\n1 Al-‘Umari, Masdlik, 157.\n\n2 Mujir, ii, 40.

It extends 19.46m west from the entrance portal of the\nRibat of ‘Ala’ al-Din (which projects 0.82m further into the\nstreet). At a point 13.11m from the ribat’s portal a salient\ncontaining the entrance to the Hasaniyya projects 0.35m from\nthe rest of the frontage. This salient has undergone major\nrepairs at some time, but otherwise the frontage remains\nlargely intact.\n\nThe lower courses of masonry in the lower storey are\ndifferent from the upper courses, which are similar to those of\nthe upper storey (see plate 55.1). The masonry of the repairs at\nthe west end is, of course, different from the rest. Its date of\nconstruction is not known. All that can be said is that it was built\nafter the ribat, since it blocks the east archway of its portal, and\nbefore — perhaps immediately before — the construction of the\nHasaniyya. At the east end a pointed-arched doorway (now\nblocked) once gave access to the space between the street\nfrontage and the south wall of the vaulted halls of the ribat. This\nspace is now inaccessible.\n\nThe main facade is on the upper storey, set back 0.02m\nfrom the frontage of the lower storey and extending eastward\nover the portal of the ribat where it projects south to follow the\nalignment of the portal. It is arranged more or less\nsymmetrically about a central slit window which opens in the\nassembly hall above the mihrab. The lintel of that window is\n decorated with an arch of miniature gadroon voussoirs on the\nouter face and a moulding on the soffit (plate 55.2). On either\nside of this window two large rectangular windows are set in\npointed-arched recesses. The arch of the left-hand (west)\nrecess has been replaced with a crude segmental arch. Though\nseveral stones in the right-hand arch have also been replaced,\nenough of it survives to show that it (and presumably the left-\nhand one) were decorated with gadroon voussoirs (plate 55.3).\nThe right-hand window retains its original grille. To west and\neast of these windows are a further two, both surmounted by\nslits. The east one is directly above the entrance portal of the\nribat.\n\nAt the west end of the frontage the entrance salient,\nincluding a short upper-storey extension supported on two\ndamaged roll corbels (plate 55.4), is about 2m lower. Much of\nthis appears to have been rebuilt.\n\nENTRANCE (plate 55.5)\n\nThe entrance has lost its original form in the rebuilding and\nnow consists of a plain segmental-arched doorway. The lowest\ncourses of masonry survive, however, and two clear breaks in\nthe masonry on either side of the doorway reveal that the\noriginal door was set in a recess and flanked by stone benches.\nThe lintel of the present door, bearing the foundation\ninscription (plate 55.6), appears to be in its original position.\nThe rebuilding of the doorway has masked much of the text of\nthe inscription but enough is legible to show that it belongs to\nthe Hasaniyya.\n\nThe doorway opens into a landing at the foot of a flight of\nStairs rising eastward to the upper floor. A blocked window in\nthe north wall of that landing may belong to the Qashtimuriya\nMadrasa which, according to Mujir al-Din, was near the\nHasaniyya; it was endowed in 759/1358. The south-east corner\nof the wall containing that window can be seen as a break in the\nmasonry some 2.37m to the east (see fig. 55.4).\n\nUPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 55.3).\nThe stairs lead up to a wide top landing from which one door\nOpens west into a small room (A) perhaps intended for the\nbawwéb, and a second leads into a barrel-vaulted passage that\nruns north then west. At the west end the vault of the passage\nhas collapsed. It leads into a group of mostly ruined structures\nthat might well originally have provided living quarters for\npersonnel on the establishment (see above).\n\nAt the corner where the passage changes direction it is\n roofed by a folded cross vault. A door in the east wall under this\nvault leads under a small porch into the open courtyard of the\nmadrasa. A cavetto cornice similar to that on the facade runs\naround three sides of the courtyard (see plate 55.7); the east\nside has been replaced (see below). Two cells (B and C) on the\nwest side of the courtyard, one of which (B) was locked and\ninaccessible to us, are lit by high-level windows on the\ncourtyard. On the north side are three cells ( D-F) with\nwindows overlooking the courtyard of the ribat to the north.\nThe common wall of cells ‘E’ and ‘F’ has been removed and the\ndoor from the courtyard into ‘E’ blocked. Both cells are now\nentered through the door of ‘F’ (which has a rebuilt head — see\nplate 55.7). In all probability a fourth cell occupied the north-\neast corner of the building, but it and the original structures on\nthe east side of the courtyard have been replaced by a modern\nconstruction. The cells on the east side of the courtyard were\nprobably similar to those on the west side . At the south end of\nthe east side a corridor runs east to give access to two rooms (G\nand H) situated above the entrance portal of the ribat. Room ‘G’\nhas a window in its north wall overlooking the courtyard of the\nribat, and room ‘His lit by the windows above the ribat’s portal.\n\nOn the south side of the courtyard a plain door flanked by\ntwo rectangular windows opens into the assembly hall. Above\nthe door is a small triple window comprising two arched lights\nsurmounted by a circular oculus (see plate 55.8) of a distinctive\ntype observed earlier at the Sallamiyya (no. 25) and the\nBasitiyya (no. 53).\n\nThe assembly hall is roofed in three bays by a folded cross\nvault with narrower cross vaults to east and west. The bays are\nseparated by two transverse arches rising from double-\nmuqarnds springers reminiscent of ones in the Palace of Sitt\nTunshuq (see fig. 48.18). The folded cross vault has single\nmuqarnas springings and a fluted cupola at the crown (see\nplate 55.9). Besides the windows on the courtyard, the hall is lit\nby windows overlooking the street (described above). Two\ncupboards open in the north wall and a third (now blocked)\nopened at the south end of the west wall. Opposite that third\ncupboard a door (also blocked) opened east into room ‘H’.\n\nMARBLE PANELLING\n\nThe outstanding feature of the assembly hall — indeed, of the\nwhole building — is an unusually well preserved marble dado\nincorporating a mibrab. This dado originally ran around all\nfour walls but some sections of it, particularly on the north wall,\nare missing. It is composed of vertical panels of fine red marble\n and black bituminous limestone framed by narrower strips of\ngreyish marble. In two places, about one metre to either side of\nthe mibrab in the south wall, the marble frame is in the form of\nan arch with a circular loop at the apex. The spandrels of the\narched frames are filled with white and black marble and the\ntympanums with red marble. Below the tympanums each frame\ncontains a panel of rare black-and-white speckled marble. The\nmarble will have come from old columns sliced along their\nlengths — a customary Mamluk (and earlier) practice. The\npanels are bedded on white plaster, and discrepancies such as\nrough chipping of the edges are filled with plaster which has\nbeen coloured appropriately red, black or grey to match. The\nwhole dado is capped by a timber bead, which separates the\npanelling from the plastered wall surface above.\n\nMIHRAB (plate 55.10)\n\nThis beautiful mihrab, one of the finest in Jerusalem, is lined\nand faced with a veneer of marble with a mosaic revetment in\nthe conch. A quirked ogee moulding frames the upper part\nwhere it projects above the dado. The lining is arranged in two\ntiers. The lower tier is the same height as the dado and consists\nof a grey marble frame containing seven slightly countersunk\npanels of alternately red marble and black limestone with\ntrilobed heads. At the apex of each of the seven panels is a little\ncircular depression in which the remains of a turquoise faience\nstud can still be seen.\n\nA timber bead separates this tier from the upper tier and\n extends onto the wall face on either side to meet the frame\nmoulding. At this level the grey marble lining contains seven\npanels of mosaic, five in the recess and one on each side on the\nwall face. This mosaic is composed variously of strips of\nmother-of-pearl and chips of turquoise faience as well as red,\nblack and yellow stone. The lining has come away in places to\nreveal wooden battens reinforcing a plaster bed.\n\nAnother timber bead separates this tier from the conch\nand the marble facing around it. An arch-shaped stone at the\nbase of the conch has the word ‘Allah’ incised in it to receive a\npaste filling that no longer survives. The mosaic pattern of six-\npointed stars and hexagons is composed of rhombs and\ntriangles of red, black, yellow and brownish stone and tiny\npieces of turquoise faience.\n\nThe veneer of grey marble around the conch is made up of\nthree large slabs complemented by three smaller pieces at the\ntop. The flamboyant decoration of this veneer — representing\nan arch of very elaborately joggled voussoirs within a frame of\novals and trefoils enclosing swags with trefoil finials in the\nspandrels — is actually an intaglio filled with red paste and\nbitumen. In this way a striking effect is achieved without the\nenormous difficulty of using real marble for the inlays. This\ntechnique developed in Cairo in the late eighth/fourteenth\ncentury, perhaps as a result of a shortage of marble.‘ This is the\nonly instance in Jerusalem. Discontinuities in the design where\nadjoining marble slabs meet suggest that the patterns were\ncarved before the slabs were raised in place. A groove chased\nround the extrados of the arch forms a loop at the apex, runs\nalong horizontally and then descends, thus forming a\nrectangular frame around the spandrels. The groove is\nencrusted with gold leaf. The circular loop at the apex is\nhollowed out as if to receive some kind of filling, of which no\ntrace survives. Four similar circular sockets at the corners of the\nouter frame above the dado and two in the loops above the\narched panels of the dado are likewise empty. Since the rest of\nthe panelling survives largely unplundered except for the\nbroken-off faience studs in the lower lining of the mihrab it is\nperhaps likely that these sockets once contained faience\nbosses.\n ','STREET FRONTAGE, ENTRANCE, UPPER FLOOR, MARBLE PANELLING, MIHRAB'),(56,'EXTERIOR ( plates 56.1 and 56.2)\n\nEach of the four external walls incorporates a pointed arch,\nblocked up except for a plain entrance door in the east side and\nrectangular windows in the other three sides.

The stone-\n\nfaced dome rises directly from the roof and culminates in a\nstone crescent finial.\n INTERIOR\n\nTwo crude steps lead up to the entrance door.

Early photographs show that a northward\ncontinuation of the facade formerly encompassed the upper\npart of Bab al-Qattanin (see plate 31.1), and this may have\nbelonged to the ‘Uthmaniyya. It was demolished in the 1920s.\nBeyond Bab al-Qatténin it contained a window that was\ndecorated very like the present window at the south end of the\nfacade, which has ablag jambs and is set ina recess spanned by\nfour tiers of mugarnas corbelling supporting a shallow fluted\nconch (see plate 57.2).\n\nTo the right (north) of this southern window are paired\nrectangular windows surmounted by a small muqarnas-\nheaded slit window above their central mullion. Further to the\nright is a single window, decorated like the paired ones with a\njoggled red and cream-coloured ablaq pseudo-relieving arch\nover the lintel and surmounted by another high-level\nmugqarnas-headed slit window. Between the two slit windows,\na curious feature in the form of a mugqarnas capital from a\nhexagonal column (fig. 57.9) projects from the facade.\n\nThe most striking feature of the facade is a large double\nwindow, the pointed arches of which are supported by three\nre-used marble columns. Above the window a panel of red and\ncream-coloured ablaq contains two roundels each composed\nof interlocking radial voussoirs. A continuous diaperwork\nmoulding runs around the extrados of both arches and\nencircles the roundels. At the top, above the roundels, a course\nof ablag joggling extends across the panel, which is framed by\ndownward vertical extensions of the billet cornice moulding.\nThese descend to the level of the springings of the arches,\nwhere the moulding ends at each side in an unusual angular\nreturn (see plate 57.3). Indistinct traces visible in van\nBerchem’s photograph” taken in 1893 suggest that the billet\nmoulding originally continued across the top of the panel.\n\nTo the right of the double window is a recess spanned by\nfour tiers of muqarnas corbelling supporting a shallow, fluted\nconch. This recess contains a grilled window with ablaq jambs\nand two ablaq pseudo-relieving arches above its monolithic\nlintel. To the right of that window is a smaller plain rectangular\nwindow.

The latter projects 1.96m beyond the frontage of\nthe portal, continuing the outer line of the terrace.\n\nThe annex extends westward from beside the entrance\nportal as far as the present entrance to the eastern wing of the\nAblutions Place, which now serves as a ladies’ lavatory. It is\nthree storeys high. A distinct change of masonry at top floor\nlevel shows that the top storey is a later construction, perhaps\npart of the repairs proposed in 1066/1656 (see above, p. 546).\nOf the two lower floors, the upper is at the same level as the\nground floor of the madrasa, while the lower forms a basement\nunderneath. A flight of eight steps in the street— one more than\nin al-‘Umari’s time, due no doubt to later resurfacing of the\nstreet — leads down to the basement level. At this lower level the\nannex has two doors opening from the street into two vaulted\nrooms that must once have been the shops referred to in the\ndocument cited above. The left-hand (eastern) door has\nobviously been rebuilt in recent years; originally it was\nprobably pointed-arched like the right-hand one. Both doors\nhave small windows above them. A window at the west end of\nthe basement facade lights the western room. Above the\nbasement four rectangular windows light three rooms at\nground floor level, described below.\n\nAs mentioned above, the decorated facade of the tomb\nchamber and the entrance portal (plate 57.4)”’ is separated\nfrom the street by a little terrace reached by a flight of seven\nsteps ascending from the street beside Bab al-Mathara (see\nplan, fig. 57.3). The principal features of this facade are framed\nby a quirked ogee moulding which extends across the base, up\nround stone benches flanking the entrance, back across the\nfacade one course above the base before rising beside the\nHaram wall (which is the eastern extremity of the facade),\nreturning right to pass above the lower window of the tomb\nchamber and then stepping up over the entrance portal and\ndown next to the annex (which is the western extremity of this\npart of the facade). Within this stepped frame moulding the\nstonework is red and cream-coloured ablagq.\n\nThe grilled lower window of the tomb chamber Opens in\na shallow recess with a sloping sill and four tiers of muqarnas\ncorbelling at the head. A joggled string course runs across the\nfacade above the level of the window lintel. Above the lintel the\nstring course incorporates a decorative relieving lintel with an\nundercut soffit. A specially elaborate piece of joggling is inlaid\nin the face of that relieving lintel. A pointed-arched window\nvertically above the grilled window also lights the tomb\nchamber. It opens in the plain masonry of the upper left-hand\ncorner of the facade, which is not enclosed by the frame\nmoulding. The dome of the tomb chamber rises above this\nmasonry, but not high enough to be visible from the confines\nof the narrow street.\n\nThe tall, pointed-arched portal recess contains the\nentrance door and a high-level window. The lintel over the\ndoor is slightly recessed behind the surrounding masonry. A\ncourse of distinctively-shaped voussoirs above it has a queer\narcuated soffit as if to represent a relieving arch. Above that\ncourse runs the joggled string course, here composed of\nspecially elaborate voussoirs like the one over the tomb\nchamber window. Two courses above that is the inscription\ncarved ona sunken panel with bow-shaped ansae at either end.\nThe window in the upper part of the recess has a muqarnas\n head and fluted conch which, though damaged by the later\ninsertion ofa timber window frame, bears astrong resemblance\nto two of the windows in the Haram facade.\n Re ER ETOUL AE TRS ST. Ee Te at She ee Oe ne) tener eae\n\ninsertion ofa timber window frame, bears astrong resemblance\nto two of the windows in the Haram facade.\n\nWEST FRONTAGE (plate 57.6)\nThe west frontage is composed of a hotchpotch of walls, most\n\nof which appear to belong to later rebuildings.\n Fone eee LAE LEY YA\n\nGROUND FLOOR (plan, fig. 57.3)\n\nThe entrance door opens into a square vestibule roofed bya\nfolded cross vault, which has a little octagonal recess decorated\nwith mugqarnas at the crown.\n\nA double door on the left (plate 57.7) opens into the lofty\ntomb chamber (10.92m high), which has windows in three\nsides: two on the street; one on the Haram; and one (now\nblocked) in a pointed-arched recess which opened south on\nthe courtyard of the madrasa. The window in the east side,\noverlooking the Haram, may have belonged originally to one of\nthe cells mentioned by al-‘Umari (see above) which predated\nthe present construction, for its embrasure is splayed\nasymmetrically as if an earlier opening in the Haram wall had\nbeen adjusted so as to open in the middle of the east side of the\ntomb chamber.\n\nAt a higher level, directly under the dome’s zone of\ntransition, a splay-face moulding in the west wall of the\nchamber reduces the plan to a perfect square (see plate 57.8\nand fig. 57.7). The transition from this square base to the\ncircular dome is effected by squinches in the four corners.\nBetween the squinches are four arched windows, blind ones in\nthe east and west sides, one now blocked in the south side, and\none in the north side which remains open.\n\nOn the floor of the chamber are two cenotaphs, one of\npinkish stone and the other of wood (plate 57.9). These stand\non a low stone plinth. Four stone posts decorate the corners of\nthe stone cenotaph. Each of the posts has eight concave sides\nwith lanceolate excisions in the corners and bulbous domical\ncaps carved with the usual ‘drooping petal’ pattern. The\nadjacent wooden cenotaph stands against the south side of the\nstone one. Since it partly oversails the stone plinth, it would\nappear that it was placed there some time after the erection of\nthe stone cenotaph (which presumably marks the grave of the\nfounder, Isfahan Shah). It is the only one in Jerusalem made of\nwood. Its west end (see plate 57.7) is inscribed with the epitaph\nof a lady, Khawand-gan, who died on 23 Shawwal 804/26 May\n1402, about thirty-five years before the construction of the\n‘Uthmaniyya. Koranic inscriptions are carved in the top and\nbottom of the four sides, and ornamental roundels are carved\nin the middle of the south, east and north sides (see plate 57.9).\n\nA door in the west wall of the vestibule, opposite the\nentrance to the tomb chamber, opens into a corridor which\nruns south past a staircase to the upper floor (see below) to\nemerge at the north-west corner of the courtyard. At the north\nend of the corridor there is a short westward extension giving\naccess to the western annex. A door in the north side of this\nextension opens into a cross-vaulted room (marked ‘A’ on the\nplan, fig.57.3) which has a window in its east wall overlooking\nthe terrace in front of the main entrance and a later window in\nits north wall. A doorway in the west side of the corridor opens\ninto a passage leading west to the roof of the eastern part of the\nAblutions Place. From this passage room ‘B’ of the western\nannex is entered, and room ‘C’ is reached through room ‘B’. A\ndoor in the south wall of the passage opens into a small,\nirregular room (D) with a door opening south to the roof of the\nAblutions Place (see plate 57.6).\n\nThe courtyard of the madrasa is now cluttered with an\nassortment of piers and abutments which support cross vaults\ncarrying later structures. Originally the courtyard was\ncompletely open to the sky. Its east wall is the Haram wall, at the\nbase of which the top ofan arch protrudes above the level of the\npavement (plate 57.10); its purpose is not known though it may\nbe connected with a gate passage, now a cistern, located by\nWarren under the courtyard.”* A well-recess at the east end of\nthe south wall of the courtyard (plate 57.10) allowed water to\nbe drawn from the cistern. The lower part of the recess is now\nblocked up. The arch spanning the recess is distinctively\ndecorated with muqarnas elements carved on the voussoirs in\na manner reminiscent of the entrance to the Basitiyya (no. 53).\nA billet moulding adorns the extrados of the arch.\n\nIn the middle of the south wall a pointed-arched opening\ninto the ‘lower mosque’ is blocked up (plate 57.11). A modern\n Staircase now rises across that blocked opening. The mosque\nitself is inaccessible as a result, but a black and white ablaq\nmibrab in its south wall was seen from the adjoining Baladiyya\nMadrasa (above, p. 451).\n\nDirectly opposite the blocked archway in the south wall,\ntwo vertical breaks in the masonry of the north wall of the\ncourtyard indicate that there was once an opening there. Traces\nof a mugqarnas springer at the western break (plate 57.12)\nshow that the opening must have been arched. It was\npresumably an arched recess like a shallow iwan echoing the\narchway in the south wall (as indicated by dotted lines on the\nplan, fig. 57.3). Fig. 57.10 is a sketch of how the north side of the\ncourtyard might originally have looked. On the right-hand\n(east) side of the arched recess a rectangular recess contains\nthe blocked window of the tomb chamber, which is partly\nconcealed by a later vault over this end of the courtyard.\n\nThe west wall of the courtyard is too much rebuilt and\nencumbered with later structures for any clear impression of its\noriginal form to emerge. It was here, presumably, that several\nof the items listed in the 1066/1656 document, such as the\nkitchen and cooking ranges, were situated. It is impossible to\n\ntell whether or not these formed part of the Original\nfoundation.\n UPPER FLOOR (fig. 57.5)\n\nThe original staircase to the upper floor must be the one\nentered from the corridor between the entrance vestibule and\nthe courtyard. A locked door at the bottom of the stairs\nprevented us from surveying this area. All we can say is that after\nrising towards the west the stairs must have turned east and\nemerged in a corridor passing eastward above the southern\nside of the tomb chamber. On the way, the stairs will have given\naccess to upper rooms and roofs on the west and south sides of\nthe courtyard and to the mezzanine room above the entrance\nvestibule, which was lit by the high window visible in the\nentrance portal.”\n\nThe corridor led to a door Opening into the north-west\n corner of the assembly hall. The assembly hall is effectively\ndivided by a modern partition wall into two parts, northern and\nsouthern. The northern part and the ‘loggia’ and another room\nto the north of it were all inaccessible to us, and our description\nof them is based on an unpublished survey made in 1979 by the\nDepartment of Islamic Archaeology, which that department\nkindly made available to us. We were able to reach the southern\npart by way of an archway in the west wall of room \'F’.\n\nAll rooms at this level appear to have been reached only by\nway of the assembly hall. A door in its north wall, beside the\nentrance from the staircase, opens into a square room roofed\nby a folded cross vault. Originally there was a dome resting on\nan eight-sided drum at the apex of the vault (see above, p. 548).\nThis room we call a loggia for it enjoys a wonderful view of the\nHaram through the splendid double-arched window in its east\n wall. A small window at the north end of its west wall overlooks\nthe street. In the middle of its north wall is a door into room ‘E’,\nthe distinctive vaulting of which appears to have been rebuilt,\npossibly in the Ottoman period. This room has two windows in\nits east wall overlooking the Haram, one in its west wall\noverlooking the street, and one in its north wall onto the roof\nof the Haram portico. If the original foundation extended\nnorthwards, as it may have done (see above, p. 547), then there\nwould have been a door in this north wall.\n\nThe northern part of the assembly hall is roofed by a cross\nvault and lit by a high-level slit window above the entrance door\nin its west wall. The assembly hall was divided into two bays by\na wide arch resting on two re-used marble columns with\nCrusader bases and thick-leaf capitals. The archway is now\nblocked. Beyond it lies the southern part of the assembly hall,\nroofed by a folded cross vault rising to a dome on an eight-\nsided drum with windows in each side (see above). It is lit also\nby two rectangular windows surmounted by a central slit in the\neast wall, overlooking the Haram, and by a rectangular window\nsurmounted by a slit in the middle of its west wall. At the south\nend of the west wall a new door has been opened in the corner\nof the hall. The south, gibla wall contains a simple mibrab\nbeside which is a cupboard on the left and a door on the right\n(plate 57.13). These openings have curious double pseudo-\nrelieving arches that contrive to give the impression of\nconcentrating load on the lintels at mid-span (see fig. 57.8).\nOne course above these pseudo-relieving arches a frieze of\nmugqarnas niches extends across the wall, rising as a\nrectangular frame above the mibrab. The wall is built of red and\ncream-coloured ablagq, now painted with whitewash. Between\nthe vertical sides of the muqgarnas frieze a course of joggling\nextends above the keystone of the mhrab arch and, above that,\nasunken panel with decoratively cusped ends is inscribed with\nthe first words of Koran ix, 18: ‘Only he shall inhabit God’s\nplaces of worship who believes in God and the Last Day’.\n\nThe door to the right of the mibrab leads into room ‘F’,\nwhich is roofed by a cross vault at the west end and by an\noctagonal domical vault at the east end; a transverse arch spans\nthe room between the two vaults. A window in the east wall\noverlooks the Haram, while one in a recess in the south wall is\npresumably a later insertion since it opens onto the north zwvdn\n of the adjoining Ashrafiyya Madrasa. An archway in the west wall\n(now partly blocked) opens into a modern room to the west.\nThis archway may once have opened into some earlier\nstructure on the roof of the lower mosque from where water\ndrawn from the cistern (see above) could have been\ndistributed.\n 1 Al-Umari, Masdlik, 162-63.\n2 Mujir, ii, 36.\n3 CIA (Ville) no. 97.\n\n4 SeeA.D.

A report dated 29 January 1921 describes it as a ‘dangerous ruin’ that\nwas shored up with metal piping. (File 78, ‘Jerusalem’ in the archives of the\nPalestine Archaeological (Rockefeller) Museum). The facade was repointed in\n1980.\n\n28 Warren Report No. XLI ‘Bab el-Mathara’, PEFOS, ii, 1869, 107.\n\n29 The document cited on P. 546 above makes it clear that by 1066/1656 there\nwere buildings at this level on both the west and south sides of the courtyard.\nWhether or not they belonged to the original construction is not known, but there\nmust originally have been something on the roof at the south end of the courtyard\nfor the well recess described above has a chimney-like shaft above it that was\nintended to permit water to be drawn from the cistern to that upper level.\n ','HARAM FAGADE, STREET FACADE, WEST FRONTAGE, GROUND FLOOR'),(58,'STREET FACADE (fig. 58.7)\n\nThe street facade is on two levels: the main facade to the left\n(west) of the Ribat of Kurt; and an upper storey facade above the\nRibat (plate 58.1). The continuity of masonry where the two\nparts of the facade overlap shows that they belong to the same\nconstruction. The structure above the upper storey is a later,\nOttoman addition.\n\nThe upper storey facade contains three windows. The\neasternmost is plain. The other two are decorated both\ndifferently and in an unusual manner. The right-hand one\n(plate 58.2) is set in a shallow recess with a sloping sill and\nthree tiers of muqarnas corbelling at the head. It retains its\noriginal iron grille. The lower part of the stone above the lintel\nis incised to a depth of about 0.02m with a curious fretwork\ndesign. Above that, a circle of reddish stones surrounds a\nroundel made up of six skew-faceted voussoirs (one of which\nis now missing) carved with a chevron moulding» The left-\nhand window (plate 58.3) has a sort of hoodmould that runs\nvertically up on either side and continues horizontally over the\nlintel. This moulding is embellished with an incised\ndiaperwork pattern of intersecting triangles: a feature observed\nearlier on mouldings at the Ghadiriyya (no. 54) and the\n‘Uthmaniyya (no. 57). Above the middle of the horizontal run of\nthe hoodmould a circular boss links it with a similarly\nembellished moulding encircling a chevron roundel identical\nto the one over the right-hand window.\n\nThe main ground-floor facade was restored in 1982-83.\nOur description deals with the facade as it was before the\nrestoration, when it retained more of the original masonry.\nThe centrepiece of this facade is a recessed entrance portal\n(plate 58.4). To the left of the portal is a high-level pointed-\narched window surmounted by a small rectangular window,\nwhich appears to be a later insertion. To the right of the portal\nis a group of three windows, of which the lower two were\noriginally a matching pair. The third window, placed above the\nlower pair, is obviously a later intrusion, The left-hand lower\nwindow retains its original configuration of red and cream-\ncoloured ablag jambs and lintel set in a shallow recess spanned\nby three tiers of rectilinear muqarnas corbelling. The adjacent\n These are some arrangements made for lands of the waqfs. The first is an jjara, and the others muqata‘a contracts.\n window must have been identical, but its corbelling was\nplundered to decorate the improvised window above and\nreplaced by a crude arch.\n\nThe horseshoe-arched recess of the entrance portal is\nconstructed of red and cream-coloured ablaq masonry\nenclosed by a quirked ogee frame moulding. Stone benches,\nframed by an extension of the same moulding, flank the\ndoorway. The red monolithic lintel is slightly recessed within a\nquadrant chamfer border. One course above the lintel is the\neffaced inscription panel, also slightly recessed, which is\ndecorated with trilobed ends. Above that panel a small double-\narched window, supported in the centre by a marble shaft,\npierces the tympanum of the portal arch.\n\nA billet moulding forms a cornice over this facade. (A\nsimilar moulding that may once have crowned the upper storey\nfacade now graces the Ottoman structure above it.) A rubble\nwall and half-arch above the lower facade are modern.\n\nDuring restoration work done in 1982 the inscription\npanel, composed of four separate marble slabs, was\ndismantled. It was then discovered that the back of one of the\nslabs bore an earlier inscription containing a royal cartouche in\nthe name of Sultan Faraj ibn Barqiig. It commemorates the\nrenewal (jaddada/juddida) of an otherwise unknown water\ntrough (hawd) some time in the first decade of the ninth/\nfifteenth century (the date is not quite clear).\n GROUND FLOOR (pian, fig. 58.3)\n\nThe double entrance doors open into a cross-vaulted vestibule,\nfrom which further doors open in the west, east and north\nsides. The west one leads into a small, unlit barrel-vaulted\nchamber (A) with a stone bench against its east wall, perhaps\nintended for the bawwdab. The door in the east side opens in a\nshallow recess with a cavetto moulding across the top: a special\nemphasis because it serves the main hall of the madrasa. To the\nnorth a doorway leads from the vestibule through a short\npassage into an iwédn-like vault (R) which opens for its full\nwidth on the courtyard (plate 58.5). In the west wall of this vault\na segmental-arched doorway gives access by way of a small\nlobby to a windowless cell (C) to the west, and a large vaulted\nhall (B) to the south, which is lit by high-level windows in its\nsouth and west walls.\n\nBeside vault ‘R’ a staircase in the south-west corner of the\ncourtyard leads to the upper floors (see below). On the other\nside of the vault ‘R’ a similar zvdn-like vault (Q) formed a porch\n(now blocked) in front of the principal entrance to the main\nhall. A door in its east wall leads into a cell (P), now filled with\nrubble. Some indication of the particular importance of the\nmain hall is given by the elaborate vaulting of this porch (see\nplan, fig. 58.3, and plate 58.6), and by the decoration of the door\ninto the hall, which is framed by a quirked ogee moulding and\nhas a lintel with a convex top surface (reminiscent of that of the\nentrance to the ‘Uthmaniyya) surmounted by a relieving arch of\nsimply joggled ablaq voussoirs (see plate 58.6).\n\nThe main hall has undergone various transformations,\nincluding the insertion of an extra window in the south wall\n(see above), the addition of a reinforced concrete wainscoting\nand, most notably, the introduction of a later vault separating\nthe hall from its original dome (see section, fig. 58.8).\n\nThe open courtyard of the madrasa is unusually long,\nthough this is no longer appararent since a modern double\nstaircase now divides it. Pointed-arched doors (some of which\nhave been given flat lintels in recent times) in the east and west\nsides of the courtyard open into ten barrel-vaulted cells, five on\neach side (D-H and L-P). (Two of the cells on the east side are\nnow inaccessible.) The northernmost door on the east side is\nblocked; a former tenant of the building described it as a\npassage (K) leading to the adjoining building (i.e. the courtyard\nof the Ribat of Kurt).\n\nAt the north end of the courtyard is a cross-vaulted iwdn,\nnow partitioned off (see plate 58.7). A door and window in the\neast wall of the iwdén open to a small room (J), roofed by twin\n cross vaults. A room (I) to the west of the ivan is now quite\n\ninaccessible — the former tenant told us that it contains a well-\nhead.\n inaccessible — the former tenant told us that it contains a well-\nhead. :\n\nUPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 58.4)\n\nThe staircase at the south-west corner of the courtyard (plate\n58.8) rises under a corbelled barrel vault up to a landing lit\nfrom the north by a high-level window (plate 58.9). A short\npassage leads south from this landing to the door into a vaulted\nmezzanine room (A?), which is lit by the double-arched\nwindow (plate 58.10) in the tympanum of the entrance portal.\nOpposite that window a chimney-like recess (now blocked) in\nthe north wall seems to be designed to provide cross-\nventilation.\n\nFrom the first landing three steps rise east to a second\nlanding, from where a further four steps lead north up to an\nopen top landing. On the west side of the top landing a barrel-\nvaulted chamber (D?) opens like a diminutive ivan (see plate\n58.11). A door in the south wall of this chamber leads into a tiny\nroom (C’), which now houses a privy.\n\nNorth from the top landing three steps descend toa gallery\nalong the west side of the courtyard. The parapet wall of this\ngallery appears to be modern, as do all parapet and screen walls\nat this level. The gallery gives access to a range of five cells (E-\nI’). The common wall of two of the cells (G? and H?) has been\nremoved, the vault renewed, and a double window inserted in\nplace of the door of ‘H”. At the north end of the gallery a\nstaircase leads up to the roofs of the cells and of the north iwédn,\nwhich now supports a modern dwelling house. Beyond the\nstaircase a short passage alongside the vault of the zwan leads\nto two small rooms (J* and K’). A strange object beside the\nentrance to ‘K” (see plan, fig. 58.4) looks as if it might be a\nhollow column base through which water could have been\ndrawn from the well said to be in the blocked room (I) below.\n\nFrom the landing at the head of the main stairs, three steps\nlead east up to an irregular terrace at the south end of the\ncourtyard. In the south-west corner of this terrace a door leads\ndown two steps into a low, vaulted room (B?) lit by a (later)\nwindow opening on the street and another opening to the west.\nOn the south side of the terrace a door opens into a queer stone\n‘igloo’ that is actually the interior of the dome over the main\nhall, now separated from it by a later floor. The interior of the\ndome is plastered. The plain exterior is paved like the rest of\nthe roofs (see roof plan, fig. 58.6).\n\nOpposite the door into the dome there will once have\n\n been six steps down to a gallery that runs north on the east side\nof the courtyard to give access to six cells (M?-R?) and, at the\nnorth end, a short corridor to a seventh cell (L?). The party walls\nbetween five of the cells (N7-R?) now contain Openings, but\nthese must be later insertions. At the south end of the gallery\nsome modern outhouses replace the steps down from the\nterrace. The extension of the gallery to oversail the courtyard is\nrecent, as are the stairs at the north end which lead up to two\nmodern apartments over this east range of cells.\n\nAt the east end of the terrace an archway opens into a\nbarrel-vaulted staircase which originally led to an assembly hall\nand loggia over the Haram portico (see below).\n\nNext to that archway is a short passageway which, though\nnow blocked except for a window, seems originally to have\ngiven access to a small inner court enclosed by those rooms\nthat are located on the roof of the Ribat of Kurt. The first of these\nrooms is to the south: a cross-vaulted iwan, evidently the one\nreferred to in a document dated 1093/1681 (see above) as the\n‘middle iwan’. Its frontal arch (see plate 58.12) is decorated in\na unique fashion with paired convex gadroons alternating with\nsingle concave ones, all framed by a hoodmould with\nornamental ‘dog-tooth’ emargination of the inner edge. The\narch is blocked by a modern partition containing a door and\ntwo windows. A window in the rear (south) wall of the zwvan\noverlooks the street. East of the zvdn three steps lead up from\nthe court to a plain door into room ‘Y”, which is roofed by a\nfolded cross vault and a deep barrel-vaulted recess to the east.\nIt is lit by two windows overlooking the street. In the middle of\n the west wall a door (now blocked) connected the room to the\nmiddle zwan. A door at the east end of the inner court opens\ninto a cross-vaulted room (W*), which has a window\noverlooking the courtyard of the Ribat of Kurt to the north.\n\nTwo arched recesses (U? and V*) open in the north side of\nthe court, under the staircase to the assembly hall and loggia.\nBoth are now partly blocked by thin partitions. A door in the\nrear wall of the east recess leads north down four steps to a\nbarrel-vaulted chamber (T?). This chamber is linked to the\nadjoining cell (R*) by a wide opening — presumably a later\nbreach — in the east wall of that cell. The east end of chamber\n‘T” is open, now leading into a flimsy modern appendage to the\neast. To the north of ‘T” a door opens into a narrow, barrel-\nvaulted chamber (S?) lit by a slit in its east wall. It is impossible\nnow to be sure that these chambers ‘T”’ and ‘S”’ belong to the\noriginal construction. They sit directly above the antechamber\nto the main hall of the Ribat, and it is quite likely that they were\nbuilt at the same time. We have suggested above (p. 148) that\nthe antechamber and ancillary structures at the south end of the\nRibat’s courtyard were added by the builders of the Jawhariyya.\nIf so, we should expect there to have been some means of\ncommunication between them and the rest of the Jawhariyya.\nThat might have been achieved by the provision of a stairway\nfrom the now ruined passageway alongside the north wall of\nthe antechamber (see plan, fig. 58.3) up to ‘S” and from there\nby way of ‘T” to the inner court. The structures at ground floor\nlevel are too dilapidated and overlaid with debris (see plate\n7.5) to reveal any trace of such a stairway.\n ASSEMBLY HALL AND LOGGIA\n\nThe barrel-vaulted staircase at the east end of the upper floor\nterrace leads up to a group of rooms (A*-C’) that are plainly of\nOttoman construction. Originally the stairs will have led onto\nthe roof of ‘W” and from there through a door in the upper\nHaram wall to the assembly hall and loggia on the roof of the\nHaram portico. These are listed as a ja@mi‘and a qamdri in the\n1093/1681 document cited above (p. 558). Salzmann’s 1854\nphotograph and Bedford’s 1862 one (plates 63.13 and 35.5)\nshow the remains of the triple-bayed assembly hall with a\nmibrab in its south wall above this section of the Haram portico.\nThe anteroom of the assembly hall of the Muzhiriyya lay to the\nsouth (see below, p. 584). This section of portico was\ndemolished and rebuilt in 1928.*° The loggia, which had a view\nof the Haram according to the document mentioned above,\n must have been to the north of the assembly hall. Only slight\ntraces of its west wall survive. And all that now remains of the\nassembly hall is part of its west wall containing a grilled window\n(now blocked) overlooking the steet. This window opens\ndirectly above the Haram gate, Bab al-Hadid (plate 58.13). On\nthe exterior it has jambs of red and greyish ablaq set in a\nshallow recess with a distinctive pointed arch of chevron\nvoussoirs — a treatment more commonly associated with\nCrusader architecture, though other examples occur in a\nMamluk context at the entrance to the Turba of Barka Khan (no.\n2) (where it may be in secondary use) and at the well-head of\nthe Is‘ardiyya (no. 33).°” The remains of a billet cornice similar\nto the one over the street facade survive above the window (see\nplate 58.13).\n ANUS\n\n1 Mujjr, ii, 37.\n\n2 CIA (Ville), 327-8, no. 99.\n\n3 Daw, iii, 82-4; Nuj., vii, 273-4; Sulitk, iv, 1234,\n\n4 Including the mother of al-Mansir ‘Abd al-‘Aziz b.

On\nthe south face (plate 59.2) this masonry is skewed back in order\nto clear a window (now blocked) in a wall that runs south from\nthe base of the minaret. This wall must be a Crusader or earlier\nconstruction since it contains an engaged column supporting\nvault and arch springings which are obviously remains of some\nCrusader building. We can safely assume, therefore, that this\npart of the base is post-Crusader. The north-west corner of the\nbase is composed entirely of Crusader stones, many of which\nbear masons’ marks. While it is a question whether these stones\nare in situ or not, it is important to note that they include a fine\nmoulding that runs continuously up the north face in what\nseems to be undisturbed Crusader masonry (see plate 59.3). If\nthat masonry is indeed undisturbed it would have appealed to\nthe builders of the minaret as solid foundation.’\n\nThe base of the minaret is bevelled twice on the east face\nand once on the west face to reduce its plan form to a square.\nApart from dish-shaped roundels in the north and south faces\n(see plates 59.2 and 59.3) and a plain projecting roundel like a\nprotruding column drum in the north face, the base is\nundecorated.\n\nFrom the Crusader column mentioned above a half-arch\nspans northwards to provide a bridge giving access to a door in\nthe south face of the base (see plate 59.2). This door opens on\na staircase rising within the core of the shaft to the muezzin’s\ngallery.\n\nA cyma recta moulding divides the base from the first\nstorey, which has pointed horseshoe-arched recesses\n containing slit windows in all four sides. The voussoirs of the\narches are of greyish and cream-coloured ablaq, framed by a\nbillet moulding which extends around the shaft at the level of\nthe springing of the arches. The typanums of the arches are\ninscribed with Koranic verses® (plate 59.4). Above the recess in\nthe south side is a sundial, now very badly worn and lacking its\ngnomon (plate 59.5), which could have been read from the\nbridge to the entrance door.\n\nA cavetto moulding carved with a repeating muqgarnas\nmotif divides the first storey from the second. The second\nstorey also has window recesses in all four sides. Those in the\neast and west sides are spanned by double arches supported on\na central column. The recesses in the north and south sides\ncontain paired slit windows and have mugarnas heads, now\nmuch damaged. The recess in the south side is further\nembellished with nook-shafts in the jambs.\n\nA shallow moulding, similar in profile to the one framing\nthe lintels on the facade of the Almalikiyya (see p. 311 above),\ndivides the second storey from the third. Little diamond-shaped\nwindows pierce all four sides of the shaft at this level. Above\neach of them is a roundel composed like the ones on the facade\nof the Jawhariyya (above, p. 558) of six skew-faceted voussoirs,\nalternately red and cream-coloured, carved with a zig-zag and\nsurrounded by a billet moulding.\n\nAbove the third storey the muezzin’s gallery is carried by\nthree roll corbels on each side. Recesses with pointed arches\ncomposed of gadrooned voussoirs open in all eight sides of the\nlantern. Those on the cardinal axes contain openings: small\nwindows in the north, west and south sides and a door in the\neast side. A continuous billet moulding frames the extrados of\nthe arches.\n ',''),(60,'The southern pier of the colonnade (plate 60.1) abuts on the\nnorth-west corner of the Qubbat al-Nahwiyya, built in 604/\n1207-8. The northern pier is substantially wider (north — south)\nthan the southern since it had to counteract any residual lateral\nthrust from the arcade without the Support of an adjoining\nstructure. The present structure abutting on the northern pier\nis a later (Ottoman) addition. A very shallow mibrab hollowed\nout in the north face of the pier must also be a later addition for\n\nits symmetrical placement takes account of that Ottoman\nstructure.\n The three pointed stilted arches of the arcade spring from\nthe two piers and two columns. The columns, with their\npedestals, bases and capitals, are obviously in secondary use.\nNo part of either column matches, the two being assembled\nfrom a variety of components all apparently Byzantine in origin.\nAbove the capitals are abaci from which the arches spring. The\nabaci are moulded to the same profile as a cornice moulding\naround the piers at the same level.\n\nThe three arches are similar in height and span. The\nmiddle arch is composed of alternately red and cream-\ncoloured ablagq voussoirs. The voussoirs of the outer arches are\ngadrooned on both faces and on the soffits where the\ngadrooning bends upwards in a series of chevrons (see plate\n60.1). A cavetto moulding around the extradoses of the arches\ncontinues at either end to form cornices on the piers. In the\nspandrels of the middle arch are the two inscription plaques on\nthe east face, and on the west face (plate 60.2) two lozenge-\nshaped recesses must once have contained some decorative\ninlay, now missing. A cavetto cornice extends across the top of\nthe arcade. Above that a gabled coping sheds rainwater.\n ',''),(62,'STREET FACADE (figs. 62.6 and 62.7; plate 62.1)\n\nThe facade is arranged asymmetrically about a tall portal recess.\nTo the right of the recess are a small pointed slit window and a\nhigher rectangular window lighting ground floor rooms; at\nupper floor level a recessed panel of ablag masonry contains a\ndouble window with pointed horseshoe arches separated by a\nmarble shaft. At the right-hand (west) end of the facade a\nchamfer with a mzqarnas head protects the north-west corner\nof the building from abrasion.\n\nTo the left of the portal a pair of identical iron-grilled\nwindows are individually recessed under four tiers of finely\nmodelled muqarnas (plate 62.2). Within each recess the\nwindow jambs are of red and cream-coloured ablaq\n supporting a lintel of greyish marble. A relieving arch above\neach lintel has alternate voussoirs of an unusual yellow stone\nlightly incised with arabesque tracery. Similar tracery\nembellishes the next-but-one course above and also the\nrectilinear mugarnas corbelling in a manner similar to that of\nthe Zamani Ribat (no. 61). The design of the tracery and of the\nmugarnas corbelling is slightly different in each recess.\nDirectly above the recesses is a double horseshoe arched\nwindow, identical to the one to the right of the portal, with a\nsmall rectangular window to its left.\n\nThe lofty entrance portal, dominating the facade, is built of\nred, yellow, black and cream-coloured ablaq enclosed within a\nquirked ogee frame moulding (plate 62.1). The shallow\n(0.80m) recess is spanned by eight tiers of fussy muqarnas\ncorbelling and a trefoil horseshoe arch. The door in the rear of\nthe recess is flanked by the usual stone benches. Its lintel is\nsurmounted by a string course of black and yellow ablaq\njoggling. Above the string course a course of red stone\nseparates it from a recessed panel which extends around the\nrecess and onto the facade where it terminates ornamentally\nwithin the limits of the frame moulding (see plate 62.2). High\nin the rear wall of the recess a small squarish window lights one\nof the upper floor rooms. It has a limestone frame 0.20m wide\nincised with tracery similar to that of the paired ground floor\nwindows. The badly weathered mugarnas corbelling rises\nfrom the level of this window’s sill up to the cusps where the\nlateral lobes of the trefoil arch meet the top lobe. This top lobe\nis filled by a very shallow conch, also carved with low-relief\n\ntracerv\n GROUND FLOOR (plan, fig. 62.3)\nThe entrance doorway is arranged with internal recesses on\neither side to allow double door leaves to lie flush with the\njambs. (The present door leaves are not original.) The door\nleads into a cross-vaulted vestibule with openings in all sides: to\nthe east a grilled window (now blocked) into a double cross-\nvaulted chamber (marked ‘H\" on the plan) lit by the paired\nwindows in the facade; to the west into a short passage leading\nto a barrel-vaulted room (A!); and to the south an archway\nSpringing from mugarnas corbels opens for the full width of\nthe vestibule into the courtyard. pert\nThe disposition of Openings around the courtyard is quite\nsymmetrical save for a gadroon-arched well recess at the north\nend of the west wall (plate 62.3), which gives access to a cistern\nunder the building. Two pointed-arched doors in each of the\neast and west walls open into barrel-vaulted cells (B\', C!, F!and\nG’) ventilated by slits (of which only the two southern ones\nremain open — see fig. 62.7) under the crowns of the vaults.\nThe tall barrel-vaulted swan occupies almost the whole of\nthe south side of the courtyard. Its pointed frontal arch springs\nfrom mugarnas corbels (plate 62.4) and its red and cream-\ncoloured voussoirs are framed by a cyma reversa moulding\nwith a circular loop at the crown. Alternate voussoirs (the\ncream-coloured ones) are each made up of two stones (see\nplate 62.5). :\nDeep excisions in the iwan’s barrel vault provide\nclearance for doors in the middle of each side wall. The one in\nthe west wall has been blocked up, rendering the room beyond\n inaccessible, while that in the east wall is now surmounted by\na window not shown in Harvey\'s drawing of 1909 (fig. 62.9).\n\nThe south, gibla wall contains a decorated mibrab flanked\nby shallow (0.21m deep) rectangular cupboard-like recesses.\nThe alignment of this wall is not at right-angles to the main\nnorth-south axis since it follows the line of the pre-existing\nnorth wall of the contiguous Khatiniyya (no. 31). This wall is\nabout 3° off the normal Mecca-orientation of the neighbouring\nqibla walls (of nos. 31 and 32) but this appears not to have\nworried the builders of the Muzhiriyya.\n\nThe pointed-arched mibrab, semicircular in plan with a\nnook shaft on either side, is set in a panel of red and cream-\ncoloured ablag, the upper part of which is framed by a\nrectangular band of black stone enclosing the arch (plate 62.6).\nThe columns, probably re-used Crusader elements, are of\nstreaky white marble resting on Mamluk bases of red stone and\nsupporting vase-shaped capitals (now badly eroded) bearing\narabesque tracery in low relief. The stone course immediately\nabove the capitals is similarly decorated, as is the base course.\nBetween these two courses the mibrab is lined with five strips\nof inlaid stone, two black on each side of a central red one, the\nblack ones having palmette finials and the red one a trilobed\nfinial. The conch is of black stone with four drop-shaped inserts\nof yellowish stone.*°\n\ncnidnnan ™ = eT ee ae ee ee\n\n UPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 62.4)\n\nAt the west end of the north wall of the courtyard three\nsemicircular steps lead into the enclosed staircase to the upper\nfloor (see plate 62.7). Access to the rooms at this level is\nprovided by a gallery round the west, north and east sides of the\ncourtyard. This gallery has been widened on all three sides, the\nextension being supported by a segmental arch spanning the\nnorth end of the courtyard (plate 62.7) and half arches\nSpanning the east and west sides. The gallery is shown as it was\nOriginally without the extension in fig. 31.9.\n\nAll the rooms are roofed with barrel vaults except for two\non the north side (A? and K?) overlooking the street, which are\nmore elaborately vaulted (as shown on the plan, fig. 62.4, and\nSection, fig. 62.8). These two rooms may have served some\nmore important function than the others. The one in the north-\nwest corner appears originally to have been entered by a door\n(now blocked; marked ‘a’ on the plan) at the head of the stairs.\nNow it is reached through a later opening from the adjoining\nroom (B*) which is in turn reached by a later door from the\nroom (C’) to its south, but which evidently was initially entered\nthrough a door (b) opening off the gallery. Room‘C” appears\nonce to have opened to the east for its full width, like an ivan.\n The other rooms at this level retain their original form. That in\nthe south-west corner (E?) has a slit window in its west wall and\na deep cupboard-like recess in its north wall. It opens to the\neast into a low barrel-vaulted windowless chamber (F*) which\nsits above the vault of the gibla iwén. For some reason this\nchamber does not occupy all the available space over the izvdn\nbut has instead a very sturdy north wall varying in thickness\nfrom 1.50m at its west end to 1.85m at its east end, It is now\npiled high with debris, but even if that were removed there\nwould not be sufficient height to stand up in this space (see\nsection, fig. 62.7). To the east of chamber ‘F”’ lie a further two\nsmall barrel-vaulted rooms (G? and H?) in the south-east\ncorner, entered from a porch at the south end of the east\ngallery. Though these rooms along the south side stand higher\nthan the single storey cells of the adjoining Khatiiniyya none\nhas a window in its south wall; indeed three (F?, G? and H2) of\nthe four have no windows at all. Two rooms (I? and J*) on the\neast side are likewise devoid of windows.\n TOP FLOOR (plan, fig. 62.5)\n\nA door at the north end of the east gallery opens into the\nstaircase to the top floor. The stair leads into two small\nchambers, ‘A® and ‘B®, over rooms ‘I”’ and J” of the upper\nfloor. The elaborate vaulting of these chambers caught Harvey\'s\nfancy: ‘curiously ornamented domes and quaintly arranged\nexamples of fan vaulting . . . delight the architect by their\nexcellent combination of structural truth and appropriate\n decoration’. His drawing of the second vault (B*) is fig. 62.10.\n\nFrom ‘B*’ a door opens east into a double cross-vaulted\nporch (D>) leading out to the roof of the Arghtniyya and from\nthere to the former assembly hall above the Haram portico (see\nbelow). Access to or from the staircase could have been\ncontrolled from a barrel-vaulted room (E°) ey to the\nsouth of the porch. A second door opens south from ‘B”’ into a\nlarge hall, ‘C? (now partly divided by a modern partition),\nroofed with two cross vaults and a folded cross vault. The\nelaborate vaulting of the two chambers at the top of the stairs is\nsome indication of the importance of these two halls, ‘C? and\nthe assembly hall. The west part of ‘C?’, with the folded cross\nvault, sits above the gibla iwan and has three windows\noverlooking the courtyard. Here again there are no windows in\nthe south wall, presumably in order not to intrude on the\nprivacy of the courtyard of the Khatiiniyya below.\n\nASSEMBLY HALL\n\nDetached from the rest of the building, the assembly hall lay to\nthe east beyond the roof of the Arghuniyya, ‘over the Haram\nportico’ as Mujir al-Din wrote. Nothing now survives of it\nexcept for a series of vaulting profiles observed in the east face\nof the upper part of the Haram wall. It was, however, still\nstanding in 1909 when Harvey visited, and it is on the basis of\nhis drawings (our figs. 62.11 and 62.12) and his description that\nit can be reconstructed with reference to early photographs\n(such as plate 35.5).\n\nAbutting against the north wall of the assembly hall of the\nJawhariyya (no. 58) stood an anteroom (fig. 62.12) leading\n south into the assembly hall (fig. 62.11). Access to the anteroom\nfrom the roof of the Arghiniyya was by way of a door in the\nupper part of the Haram wall. The room was roofed with a\n folded cross vault rising to an octagonal cupola decorated in\nplaster with two tiers of muqarnas under a fluted domelet. A\ndouble window with horseshoe arches separated by a central\ncolumn (similar to those in the street facade) overlooked the\nHaram.\n\n‘Evidently the assembly hall was vaulted in three bays:\nintersecting barrel vaults to south and north of a central folded\ncross vault rising to an octagonal cupola decorated with\nchevron ribs spreading outward and upward from eight small\nmugqarnas niches. Harvey’s drawing, fig. 62.11, shows only the\ncentral and southern bays but we may assume the third,\nnorthern, one since profiles of three vaults, in addition to that\nof the anteroom, are discernible in the east face of the Haram\nwall; and virtually all assembly halls in Mamlik Jerusalem have\ntripartite vaults. Each bay overlooked the Haram through\npaired pointed-arched grilled windows, and each had paired\nrecesses (now blocked up) in the east wall (visible in the\nsurviving masonry though not shown in Harvey’s drawing).\nThese recesses: must have been cupboards, not windows, for\nthere is no trace of openings in the west face of the wall.\n\nA mibrab in the south, gibla wall of the assembly hall\n(photographed by Creswell in 1920, plate 62.9) was flanked by\nsmall recesses on either hand (fig. 62.11).\n\nTo the south of the assembly hall were further structures\non the roof of the Haram portico (see plate 35.5), demolished\nat the same time as the assembly hall, which probably belonged\nto the ‘Uthmaniyya (no. 57).\n SOU Se\n\n1 An aerial photograph dated 30 March 1925 in the archives of the Palestine\nArchaeological (Rockefeller) Museum, File 78 ‘Jerusalem’, shows the demolished\nportico at Bab al-Hadid and the structures it supported.\n\n2 These drawings, reproduced here as our figs. 62.9-62.12, were made by\nWilliam Harvey in 1909 and reproduced in his article ‘A Saracenic School,\nJerusalem’, The Builder, 2 April 1910, 373-74.\n\n3 Mujir, ii, 37; cf.

A shaykh of this madrasa, Shams al-Din Muhammad b.\nQasim b. ‘Ali al-Shafi\'l, died in Sha‘ban 893/July-August 1488 (Ibn lys, iii, 254).\n19 Ibn lyas, iii, 255.\n\n20 Ibn lyas, iii, 429 and 440.\n\n21 Ibn lyds, iv, 67 and 70-71.\n\n22 Ibn lyas, iv, 75-76.\n\n23 Defter 602, 450.\n\n24 Sijill 30, no. 1425, dated 962/1555.\n\n25 Sijill 58, 94 (1). The Sarara land is frequently mentioned in theJerusalem sijills,\nsee, for example, Sijill 40, 470 (3).\n\n26 Sijill 185, 108-9, dated 1093/1682.\n\n27 Asali, Ma Gbid, 194, quoting Sijill 94, no page cited, but dated Safar 1022.\n\n28 Asali, loc. cit., quoting Sijill 220, 73 and Sijill 267, 150.\n\n29 Asali, loc. cit.\n\n30 This decoration of the semidome is similar to that of the east portal of the\npalace of Sitt Tunshug (above, p. 487). Whether or not this type of decoration is\nmeant to represent the word ‘Allah’ [ie: @)<d\\<all ] remains a matter for\nconjecture.\n ','STREET FACADE, ASSEMBLY HALL'),(63,'GROUND FLOOR (fig. 63.3)\n\n(i) Assembly hall\n\nThe assembly hall incorporates three bays of the west portico of\nthe Haram, built in 737/1336-37, which form the western part of\nthe hall. The eastern part is vaulted in three bays built against\nthese three bays of the portico (see section, fig. 63.8). Four\npiers of the portico support the vaults; two of the piers remain\nfree standing in the middle of the hall and two are built into the\nnorth and south walls (see plan, fig. 63.3). Part of the north wall,\nwhere it abuts against the pier, is carried on a half-arch (plate\n63.2), apparently designed to discharge the weight of the wall\nonto new foundations rather than onto the foundation of the\npier. This sensible precaution minimized the turning moment\non the pier and so reduced the risk of collapse.** To west and\neast of that pier are respectively a grilled window and a door in\nthe north wall of the hall. Both are built of red and cream-\ncoloured ablaq masonry enclosed within a quirked ogee frame\nmoulding. Above the window is a smaller rectangular window,\nand above the door is a pointed-arched window.\n\nIn the middle of the east wall of the hall is a door with a\nrectangular window on either side of it (fig. 63.5, plate 63.3), all\nconstructed in ablaq enclosed by frame mouldings like those\nin the north wall. Each is surmounted by a pointed-arched\nwindow. The three openings in this east wall were restored\nrecently when the Aqsa Mosque Library was established in the\nhall.\n\nA more elaborately decorated window surmounted bv a\n circular oculus opens in the eastern part of the south wall (see\nbelow). A pointed-arched mibrab of red and cream-coloured\nablag occupies the western part of the wall. It has recesses on\neither side to take nook-shafts but these are no longer in place.\nA small rectangular window above the mihrab is now blocked\nup. Between the window and the mibrab a pier of the earlier\nportico projects into the hall (see plan, fig. 63.3; and section, fig.\n63.8). Immediately to the right of the mihrab the wall is stepped\nback in order not to block an earlier window, now a door,\nwhich opens in the rear wall of the east zwdan of the Baladiyya\n(above, p. 449), which is the Haram wall forming the west\nboundary of the assembly hall. Another window of the\nBaladiyya, that of room ‘A’ to the north, originally opened\nunder the Haram portico but now opens into this hall.\n\n(ii) Entrance\n\nThe impressive entrance porch (plate 63.4 and fig. 63.7) stands\ndirectly to the south of the assembly hall. Both the porch and\nthe hall were built together, as the continuity of the masonry\nshows. Therefore, if the Coptic architect in charge of the final\nconstruction of the Ashrafiyya, including the entrance porch,\nretained anything of the earlier assembly hall on the site (see\nabove, p. 591) it must have been no more than its plan and\npossibly its foundations.\n\nThe porch opens through two pointed arches to east and\nsouth. Both arches are similarly constructed of red and cream-\ncoloured ablagq vousssoirs enclosed by a quirked ogee\nmoulding with little loops above the keystones. Iron tie bars are\nused to connect the springings in order to counteract the\ntendency of any residual outward thrust to overturn the\nsupporting pier at the south-east corner of the porch. An\nengaged column carved with low relief arabesques and bearing\na royal inscription in the name of Qaytbay*’ above the base,\narticulates the outer corner of that pier (see plate 63.3). (A\nsmaller engaged column adorns the north-east corner of the\nassembly hall.)\n\nThe vaulting of the porch is a very elaborate form of folded\ncross vault (plate 63.5) of a type that was popular in Cairo\nduring Qaytbay’s reign.” Alternate courses are painted red to\nsimulate ablaq. The south-east corner of the vault appears to\nhave been rebuilt at some time; it also is painted to simulate\nablaq though here the painting and the underlying stone\ncoursing do not coincide (see plate 63.5). A cruciform panel\ncarved in low relief with strapwork star patterns is set into the\ncrown of the vault with four smaller lozenges of arabesque\n inserted between the pointed arms of the cruciform panel and\nthe sides of the vault.\n\nOn the north side of the porch is a stone bench above\nwhich is the grilled window in the south wall of the assembly\nhall (see above) set in a shallow recess spanned by an angular\n mugqarnas hood. The window has ablag jambs and a lintel\ncomposed of three interlocking stones and decorated with low\nrelief carving. Above the lintel is a joggled pseudo-relieving\n— surmounted by the oculus composed of ablaq voussoirs,\na\n\nSo decorated with low relief carving. Each of these\n components is framed by a narrow band of red stone. The three\ntiers of mugarnas corbelling spanning the recess are\ndecorated with low relief arabesques similar to those shown in\nplate 63.6. On either side of that corbelling and in the\ntympanum above, more arabesque carving surrounds three\ncircular royal cartouches of Qaytbay (fig. 63.10).\n\nThe entrance doorway is set in a trefoil-arched recess in\nthe west wall of the porch (plate 63.4). As if to compensate for\nits secluded position, the builders seem to have employed\nevery technique of decoration available to them. It is\nconstructed of black, red and cream-coloured ablaq, each\ncourse being bedded on a thin sheet of lead that, when new,\nwould have appeared on the surface as a thin black line. This\ntechnique of using lead instead of mortar for aesthetic effect\nappears to have developed in Cairo during the ninth/fifteenth\ncentury.”! The lead and the ablagq extend only as far as a double\nquirked ogee moulding (fig. 63.7) which frames the recess (see\nplate 63.4 and fig. 63.5). This moulding extends to frame stone\nbenches flanking the door. At regular intervals little circular\nloops (called ‘mims’ in Arabic since they resemble that letter in\nArabic script) punctuate the moulding. The joggled ablaq faces\nof the benches are decorated with palmette inserts beside the\ntrefoil extensions of the frame moulding. Six courses above the\nthreshhold the inscription recording the completion of\nconstruction” (see above, p. 591) extends around the recess,\ninterrupted by the door opening, and terminates at each end in\ntrefoil ablag finials just inside the frame moulding. The door\nlintel is a single block of mottled grey granite, on either side of\nwhich are small rectangular panels of arabesque carving. Above\nthe lintel is a pseudo-relieving arch composed of intricately\ninterlocking voussoirs of black and cream ablaq. This arch is\nflanked by two panels of carved strapwork. A band of red stone\nframes these panels and the pseudo-relieving arch. A\nrectangular grilled window above the arch lights the vestibule\nwithin. The intricate decoration of the portal culminates in the\nvaulting of the recess. Enclosed by the trefoil arch are two\nmuqarnas corner squinches supporting a shallow semidome.\nAlternate voussoirs of the trefoil arch are covered with\narabesque carving. The same carving is applied also to the\nsurface of the muqgarnas squinches (plate 63.6). The limestone\nsemidome is inlaid with a fantastic pattern of scrolls and\npalmettes in red stone highlighted here and there with inserts\nof a black substance (stone or bitumen) and of turquoise\nfaience. The original timber door leaves, of walnut inlaid with\npinewood according to the wagfiyya,’ bound by beautiful\n SULIT AY EY VA\n\ninscribed brass bands (fig. 63.11), are now in the Islamic\nMuseum on the Haram.\n\nThe doors open in a splayed embrasure to the lofty\nvestibule, which is roofed by a multi-faceted cross vault similar\nto that of the porch except for an octagonal panel in place of a\ncruciform one at the crown (fig. 63.12). It is built entirely of\nlimestone ashlars. A stone bench, originally faced with marble,\n» occupies a pointed-arched recess that spans almost the full\nwidth of the back (west) wall. The rear wall of this recess is the\nHaram wall and in that wall are the remains of one of the\nspringers of that part of the portico that was demolished to\nmake way for the present building (see above, p. 591). To the\nleft (south) of the springer is a curious window with a high,\nsteeply sloping sill like a chute (now partly blocked, see plate\n63.7). This appears to have been an abat-jour admitting light to\nthe vestibule from the outer court above.\n\nOn the north side of the vestibule a pointed-arched\ndoorway, the ablaq voussoirs of which are framed by a quirked\nogee moulding with a loop at the top and volutes under the\nspringers, opens into a small room (marked ‘M’ on the plan),\nnow used for storing coffins, lit by a grilled window in its east\nwall beside the entrance portal.The vault of this room supports\na mezzanine chamber, identical in plan, reached by steps\nthrough an opening in the west end of its floor, and lit by a\nwindow in its south wall opening on the vestibule. The window\nin its north wall, opening above the mibrab in the assembly\nhall, is blocked (see above).\n\nA pointed-arched doorway in the south wall of the\nvestibule, decorated in the same way as the one in the north\nwall, leads through a small cross-vaulted hall (N), lit by a\nwindow in its east wall, to the main staircase to the upper floor.\nThe west end of the hall, at the foot of the stairs, is roofed by a\nfolded cross vault with an octagonal panel of carved strapwork\nset into its crown (plate 63.8). On the west side of this hall is the\ngrilled window of the Baladiyya tomb chamber (see above, p.\n449) opening in the Haram wall.\n\nSTAIRCASE\n\nThe staircase rises in eight flights round a rectangular core (see\nfig. 63.3). All the flights except the top one are roofed by rising\nbarrel vaults. There are landings between the flights, the first\nand third roofed by cross vaults, the seventh (top) by a barrel\nvault, and all the others by folded cross vaults with octagonal\npanels set into the crowns (fig. 63.13). At each eastern landing a\nwindow opens on the Haram. These windows, pointed-arched\n\n—s\n\nee ee\n on the inside and rectangular on the outside, are arranged in\npairs with externally matching sill and head heights so as to\nconceal the fact that there is a stair within (see plate 63.9 and fig.\n63.5). In the north wall of the fourth landing a door (now\nblocked) opens into a mezzanine chamber above the hall \'N , lit\nby a grilled window in its north wall opening on the vestibule.\nThe window grille is made of turned wood: In the south wall of\nthe staircase a vertical break in the stonework marks the\nconjunction between the staircase and the earlier base of the\nminaret (plate 63.10). From the top landing two windows (now\nblocked) opened north into the south ivan of the madrasa (see\nJig. 63.4). A door opens south from the same landing into a\nparallel flight of eight steps that lead up to the entrance to the\nminaret. Just beyond that door a second door (now blocked)\nled into a narrow room (0) lit by a window in its south wall.\n\nUPPER FLOOR (fig. 63.4)\n\nAt the west end of the top landing a pointed-arched door leads\ninto the outer court. The west face of the door (plate 63.11) is\ndecorated like those in the side walls of the entrance vestibule\n(see above).\n\n() Upper terrace\n\nFacing that door is a pointed-arched door, similarly decorated,\nopening at the south end of the west parapet wall of the outer\ncourt. This door opens directly to the upper terrace, situated\nabove the southern part of the Baladiyya. A Parapet wall on the\nnorth side of the terrace shields the courtyard of the Baladiyya\nbelow from view. On the south side of the terrace are six doors\nleading into six vaulted cells (S-X). The first of these (S) was\nprobably lit originally by a window in its south wall,\noverlooking the roof of Tankiz’s ribat (see above, p. 240), now\nblocked by later buildings to the south. Cell ‘T’ was originally\nsimilar to ‘S’. The window in its south wall is now a door. Its\nentrance door was recently blocked and it is now reached from\nthe adjoining cell (U) by way ofa new door in the common wall.\nThe south wall of ‘U’ appears to have been dismantled at some\ntime and replaced by a much thinner wall containing no\nwindow. Cells ‘V-X’ seem never to have had windows in their\nsouth walls, the opening in the south wall of ‘Ww’ being a later\nmodification.\n\nAt its west end the terrace turns north over the west iwan\nof the Baladiyya. In the corner where the south and west parts\nof the terrace meet, a masonry salient contains the door of cell\n‘X’ which is bigger than the others. The double window in its\nwest wall is a later insertion.\n\nOf the five cells that were situated according to the\nwagfiyya™ on the west side of the terrace, nothing remains. The\npresent structures there are modern. Nor does any trace exist\nof the bab al-mutawadda’, the ‘door of the ablution place’,\nwhich according to the wagfiyya was situated at the north end\nof the terrace. It is unclear whether or not that door led into a\nprivate ablution place reserved for the occupants of the\nmadrasa. It is conceivable that it led-to the mihlin chile...\n place immediately to the north (the Siqaya of al-‘Adil built in\n589/1193 which, though much rebuilt, still serves its intended\npurpose to this day).\n\n(ii) Outer court\n\nAt the south end of the outer court are three doors (plate\n63.11), two with pointed arches flanking a rectangular one. The\nleft-hand door opens into a passage (P) leading towards the\nproperty over the Haram gate, which in 895/1490 when the\nwadfiyya was drawn up belonged to the heirs of Shaykh Shihab\nal-Din al-‘Umayri (see above, p. 589). This may be the door\nreferred to in the wagfiyya as the bdb sirr,® the ‘secret door’,\nsince it would have allowed direct access to the madrasa from\nthe house of al-‘Umayri, the first shaykh of the madrasa (see\nabove, p. 592).\n\nThe central rectangular door opens into a small room (Q)\nlit by a window in its south wall. On the left (east) just inside the\ndoor is a low opening, now fitted with a grilled door (plate\n63.12), which leads into a narrow winding staircase down to the\nentrance of the Baladiyya (see above, p. 447). This also may be\nthe secret door referred to in the wagfiyya (the text is not clear)\nsince it allowed access to and from the madrasa that was\nindependent of the main stairs up from the Haram.\n\nA door (presumably a later insertion) in the west wall of\n‘Q’ opens into the adjoining room (R), which is entered\nthrough the third (western) door at the south end of the outer\ncourt. A recess in the south wall may originally have contained\na window, now blocked by adjoining constructions to the\nsouth. In addition the room is lit by a high-level window\n(possibly a later insertion) which Opens north on the upper\nterrace. The west wall has been removed to connect this room\nwith the adjoining cell (S).\n\nThe parapet wall on the west side of the court, like those\nof the upper terrace, shields the Baladiyya courtyard from view.\nIt is remarkable how carefully the privacy of adjoining\nbuildings is preserved.\n\nThe upper part of the east wall of the outer court is\nmissing, though some idea of its original height (about 10.5m)\nmay be gained from Salzmann’s photograph taken in 1854\n(plate 63.13) when part of the wall was still standing. Two\nshallow recesses with sloping sills in the surviving lower part of\nthe wall contain four windows (now blocked), three in the\nsouthern recess (plate 63.14) which opened on the south iwan\nof the madrasa, and one in the northern recess which opened\non the west iwén. The decoration of these windows is similar\nto that of the window in the north wall of the entrance porch on\nthe ground floor: ablaq jambs, lintels composed of three\n interlocking stones carved with low relief strapwork, and\njoggled pseudo-relieving arches (plate 63.15). A sundial in the\nwall between the two recesses was designed to display the time\nwith respect to the beginning of the afternoon prayer and also\nthe beginning and end of the interval during which it was\npermitted to perform the prayer” (see fig. 43.5).\n\nAt the north end of the court stood an impressive portal, of\nwhich only the lower part remains, now incorporated into a\n modern wall (plate 63.16). Its decoration, described in great\ndetail in the wagfiyya,® recalls that of the main entrance on the\nground floor: red, white and black ‘marble’, flanking stone\nbenches, panels of carving on either side of the lintel and\nrelieving arch, a panel of inscription gilded on an azure\nbackground, a window (flanked by two small marble columns)\nabove the door, all set in a recess spanned by a mugqarnas hood\n(see fig. 63.9). The door leaves were of walnut inlaid with\npinewood, bound with filigreed brass bands, with two heavy\nrings of inlaid brass or bronze for handles.\n\nThis doorway gave access to a group of rooms, none of\nwhich survives. Mujir al-Din’s description and the text of the\nwadfiyya tell us that it opened into a vestibule from where a\n short passage (marked ‘Y on the plan, fig. 63.4) leads east into\nthe madrasa. Another door opened north into a vaulted room,\nrichly panelled in marble.” Two windows (the southern of\nwhich is now blocked) in the east wall of this room opened on\nthe north zwdn of the madrasa. Opposite one of these windows\nwas a door into a latrine (mustarah) with a paved floor in which\nwas a basin (bawd) for water. From the latrine, steps led to an\nupper chamber. On the right of its entrance were two windows,\none with a screen of turned wood overlooking the Baladiyya to\nthe west, and another opening on a small yard in which was a\ndoor into a room over the vestibule. From this description it\nwould seem that the largely modern boundary wall of the\npresent structure to the north of the outer court must follow\nmore or less the line of the original boundary walls (see plan,\nfig. 63.4, which includes dotted lines to show how the original\ninternal walls might have been arranged). Room ‘T’ of the\nBaladiyya (above, p. 451), which has a curious shaft in its north\nwall, is directly below where the Ashrafiyya latrine appears to\nhave been located.\n\n(iii) Madrasa\n\nThe passage (Y) from the vestibule leads into the north-west\ncorner of the central court (called diirqda in the wagqfiyya) of\nthe madrasa. Only the lower 5.70m of the west wall (originally\nabout 10.5m high) and of the western parts of the north and\nsouth walls of the madrasa survive. The eastern parts,\noverlooking the Haram, have almost entirely disappeared. On\nthe basis of the surviving remains (plates 63.3 and 63.17) and\nthe text of the wagfiyya we can, however, establish its original\nform and decoration. It had four axial iwdns disposed\nsymmetrically around the central court.\n\nSouth iwan. The south iwén was the largest. The mibrab\nin the middle of its south wall has recesses in each side for\nnook-shafts but these no longer survive (plate 63.18).\nConstructed of plain limestone, the mibrab was originally\ndecorated with some sort of veneer, as pick marks in the\nspandrels indicate. The wagfiyya describes it as being lined\nwith black and white marble, porphyry and mottled granite.\nTo the right of the mibrab are the two windows (now blocked)\nthat opened on the top of the staircase (plate 63.19); to the left\nwere two more windows, overlooking the Haram to the south.\nIn the west wall of this zvdn are the three windows (now\nblocked) which opened on the outer court, and opposite these,\nin the east wall of the ivan, were another three windows\noverlooking the Haram to the east. Above all these openings a\ngilded Koranic inscription,°! the western part of which survives\n(see plate 63.19), ran around the walls of the iwdan and\ncontinued round all the interior walls of the madrasa. A lobed\nroundel within the inscription above the mibrab may once\nhave contained a royal cartouche (see below), but it is too badly\neroded to tell.\n\nNorth twain. The north iwdn was similar to the south zvdn\nexcept for its depth (5.31m as opposed to 8.02m), which\nallowed room for only two windows in its west and east walls.\nOf five arched recesses in its north wall only the western three\n\n meEmMail UPLAte\'OD.4U) lacie Crow he oa oe\niwan. The missing eastern pair were windows overlooking the\nHaram to the north. The three blind western arches could not\ncontain windows since the earlier ‘Uthmaniyya lies\nimmediately beyond them; they were used instead as\ncupboards for books that formed part of the madrasa’s\nendowment.” (The central cupboard has a recent window into\nthe ‘Uthmaniyya in its rear wall.) The eastern cupboard,\nopposite the mibrab, has recesses in each side, presumably for\nnook-shafts matching those of the mibrab but these no longer\nsurvive. The spandrels of the arches are decorated with\narabesque carving in low relief. Above ran the Koranic\ninscription which includes above the eastern cupboard the\nsurviving lower half of a lobed roundel, like the one over the\nmibrab, containing a royal cartouche in the name of Qaytbay.\n\nSalzmann’s early photograph (plate 63.13) shows that the\nexterior decoration of the two eastern windows was similar to\nthat of the windows on the east side of the outer court,\ndescribed above.\n\nTraces of a springing above the west abutment of the\niwan’s frontal arch (visible in plate 63.20) show that the arch\nrose from muqarnas imposts, was slightly horseshoed, and was\ncomposed of red and cream-coloured ablaq voussoirs framed\nby a double quirked ogee moulding with loops (‘mims’) at\nregular intervals around the extrados. It would be safe to\nassume that the frontal arch of the south zwén was similar.\n\nWest iwéin. The springers of the frontal arch of the west\niwan also survive, and these show that though this arch was\ndecorated like that of the north wdén it was highly stilted. The\nreason for this difference can be deduced from the plan (fig.\n63.4), for whereas the north and south iwvdns spanned almost\nthe full width of the central court, the west zwén is flanked by\nthe door of the entrance passage (Y) to the north and by\nanother doorway to the south which gave access to stairs\nleading up to the roof. This meant that the west zwvdn was only\n4,.26m wide compared with approximately 7.65m for the north\nand south iwéims, and so for the west ivan to rise to the same\nheight as these others it had to be stilted. The window (now\nblocked) in the west wall of the zwvén opened on the outer\ncourt.\n\nEast twdan. Nothing whatsoever survives of the east 7wan,\nhutiwe know fram the wading and Miaiir al-Din’s descrintion\n that this was the most significant one. Its frontage on the central\ncourt of the madrasa must have been very similar if not\nidentical to that of the west zwdn, comprising a central stilted\narch flanked by two doorways. What made this zvédn different\nwas the treatment of its east wall. Here was a triple window\noverlooking the Dome of the Rock. It had three arches\nsupported on two marble columns with gilded capitals and\nbases resting on a low parapet wall (the lower part of which\nsurvives — see plate 63.3). The tympanums of the arches were\nfilled with polychrome glass, presumably arranged in\ndecorative patterns set in plaster tracery, with circular shields\nin the centre bearing religious invocations in green glass.” This\ntype of window is called gamariyya in Arabic and the wagfiyya\nrefers to the east zwdn as a maq ad qamari, Mujir al-Din uses\nthe term ‘drima, equivalent to ‘loggia’ in English. The\nsignificant feature of this loggia was the uninterrupted view it\ngave of the Haram and the Dome of the Rock.\n\nThe floors of the central court and the zwans were paved\nwith polychrome marble, and a marble dado covered the lower\npart of the walls. The floor of the court was one step lower than\nthose of the zzvdns; the steps on the south and north sides were\nof white ‘Gaza’ marble, and those on the west and east sides\nwere of ‘Aleppo’ marble.® The courtyard and the iwdns had a\ntimber roof with, in all probability, an octagonal lantern over\nthe centre of the courtyard. Such octagonal lanterns are a\ntypical feature of contemporary madrasas in Cairo. The carved\nwooden ceiling was painted gold and azure. The roof itself was\ncovered with a lead cladding. The ceiling was very high. Al-\nNabulusi, who visited Jerusalem in 1101/1690 and again in\n1105/1693, wrote a detailed account of the building in which he\nclaimed that it was as high as the adjoining minaret, but this is\nclearly an exaggeration. Nevertheless, we know from the\nwagfiyya that the madrasa’s windows were surmounted by\nother windows, and by extrapolating an arch from the\ncurvature of the surviving springer of the north iwdn and\ncollating the result with Salzmann’s photographs, it can be\nshown that the ceiling was not less than 10.5m above the floor.\nGiven this imposing height and the extraordinarily elaborate\ndecoration (plate 63.20) it is easy to understand why Mujir al-\nDin was moved to describe the madrasa as the ‘third jewel’ of\nthe Haram, the other two being the Aqsa Mosque and the Dome\nafthe Rack” (fios 63.6 and 63.9).\n Notes\n\n1 MH.

Rogers, ‘Waqfiyyas\nand Waqf-registers’, K. des O., xi, 1976-77, 185 n. 9.\n\n66 Two quite different reconstructions of the Haram facade have been attempted.\nThe first, by D. Chen, is unrealistic: S. Tamari, ‘Al-ASrafiyya: an Imperial Madrasa\nin Jerusalem’, Memorie della Classe di Scienze morali, storiche e filologiche\nAcademie dei Lincei, xix, 1976, 537-68, pl. v. The second (reproduced here as\nfig. 63.6) gives a good idea of how the madrasa might originally have looked: AG.\nWalls, ‘Al-Ashrafiyya: Third Jewel of the Third Shrine of Islam’, Arts and the Islamic\nWorld, ii, 1984, 7-12.\n\n67 Mujir, 383.\n ','GROUND FLOOR, STAIRCASE, UPPER FLOOR'),(64,'EXTERIOR (elevations, figs. 64.3-04.0)\n\nThe sabil is an often repaired structure of three distinct ‘storeys’\n(plate 64.3). A rectangular base (7.65m high) supports a\ntransition zone (2.18m high) carrying a short drum and pointed\ndome (3.45m high). Thus the overall height is 13.28m. The\nsouth, west and north sides of the base are pierced by large\n(3.42m x 1.94m) grilled windows. The east side contains the\nentrance door.\n\nThe base storey is not quite square in plan at the exterior,\nbeing 4.60m x 4.80m. The extra length is due to the thickening\nof the eastern side for the well-recess. Consequently, while the\nwest facade (fig. 64.5) is symmetrical, the north and south\nfacades (figs. 64.6 and 64.4) are asymmetrical with the window\nplaced somewhat west of centre in each. Engaged columns with\ntypical Mamliik bases and muqarnas capitals articulate the four\ncorners.\n\nThe ablag construction in courses of alternately red and\ncream-coloured stone begins immediately west of a vertical\ndoubled quirked ogee moulding on the north and south\nfacades (figs. 64.6 and 64.4). It continues west interrupted only\nby the vertical mouldings (for which cream-coloured\nlimestone is used throughout) through the north-west and\nsouth-west corner shafts (plate 64.4) onto the west facade. The\nnorth-west and south-west corner shafts are composed of\nalternating courses of red and cream-coloured zig-zag\ncomponents; the cream-coloured ones are carved with\narabesque and strapwork reliefs. The interlocking voussoirs of\nthe window lintels (not original, see below, p. 610) are also\nablaq. A flight of four stone steps leads up to a stone shelf at the\nbase of the north and west windows. On the south side, where\nthere is no need for steps owing to the additional height of the\nopen-air prayer platform, an ancient sarcophagus” is placed\nbelow the window shelf. All three stone shelves are supported\nby four typically Mamlik brackets: those at the north and south\nwindows are similar while the two central brackets on the west\nside are slightly more elaborate (fig. 64.5).\n\nThe east facade (fig. 64.3) is constructed in cream-\ncoloured limestone ashlar, which returns through star-\n moulding of the north and south windows where the ablaq\ncoursing begins. The south-east corner shaft is carved with a\nrepeating arabesque arranged round simple eight-pointed star\npatterns and six-lobed rosettes (plate 64.5). The north-east\ncorner shaft is carved with a now much disfigured pattern of\nstrapwork in which eight-pointed stars play a role (see\nreconstruction fig. 64.9). The plain entrance door (1.95m x\n0.89m) is reached by four semicircular stone steps (not\noriginal, see p. 610) resting on the pavement of the prayer\nplatform. Above the entrance the double moulding projects 3\ncms more than elsewhere. This moulding frames a red\nmonolithic lintel bearing on small stalactite shoulders, a\nrelieving arch of ablaq joggling, and an arrangement of three\nupright oblong stone tablets. Here the moulding is enriched by\nhexagonal links enclosing floral bosses (plate 64.6). Clearly\nthis moulding, distinct from the rest, is an integral part of the\npanel of decoration over the door (fig. 64.3). The moulding\nextends to either side with irregularly spaced plain circular\nlinks to form the lower border of the band of inscription which\nruns around the four sides. This inscription, which contains\nsome Koranic verses and details of the foundation and\nrestorations (see above, p. 606), is surmounted by a similar\nmoulding. On the east face, below this moulding, an\nundecorated water spout (fig. 64.3) drains rainwater from the\ngutter! cut into the upper end of this storey at the foot of the\nreceding second storey, which is the zone of transition. Placed\nwhere it is, the spout spills water from the gutter over that\nportion of the east wall that is devoid of decoration (see fig.\n64.3); any elaborate ornament here would be quickly eroded.\n\nThe zone of transition, square in plan at its base, is stepped\ntwice externally. The first step converts the square to an\noctagon with its corners supported by half-pyramidal\nbuttresses” (fig. 64.10). The second step, from the octagon to\na dodecagon has a half-pyramidal buttress on each of the eight\ncorner facets. A pointed-arched window is placed centrally in\neach side. This storey is crowned by a cyma reversa cornice\nwhich extends on the east side round a water spout draining a\ngutter cut into the twelve-sided upper surface of the transition\nzone (plate 64.7).\n\nOn top of the transition zone sits in recess a plain circular\ndrum, two courses high, which supports the dome. The\nexterior of the dome is somewhat deformed by the action of\nearthquakes and the effect of unchecked vegetation, which has\neroded the pointing. The surface of the dome is covered with\nsweeping arabesques, carved in low relief in a distinctive\nbevelled style. The uppermost details of the decoration are\nextremely difficult to distinguish since a later restoration has\n\nIME UE\n\nat. a, fe\n obscured the carving under a layer of cement. The whole is\ncapped by a typical Islamic crescent finial of bronze, which,\nunlike others in the Haram, faces east-west rather than north—\nsouth.\n\nThe carving of the dome, quintessentially Egyptian in style,\nshows little resemblance to Egyptian craftsmanship in the\ntechnique of its construction. Not only is the ‘apex-seeking’\npattern less evenly and elegantly adapted to the dome surface\nthan in Cairo examples, but also there is no consistent\ncoordination between the vertical axes of the pattern and the\nvertical joints in the masonry, as was hitherto a cardinal rule.’\nThis anomaly led Christel Kessler to suggest that the team of\nEgyptian craftsmen responsible for the construction did not\ninclude a dome specialist. She notes furthermore that the\ndesign is not fully interpreted; that is, not all parts of the\narabesque foliage are carved out in the oblique cutting\ntechnique usually applied to give a filigree refinement, and\nwhere the carving is executed it is often handled in such a way\nas to obscure rather than enhance the motif (e.g. the pairs of\nlarge leaves at the lower rim, see plate 64.7). Such\nimperfections are not found in any of the other arabesque\ndecorations elsewhere on the sabil, and therefore give the\nimpression that the carving of the dome, or at least part of it,\nwas left to hands unfamiliar with the work. Thus, Kessler\nconcludes, the Egyptian team was prevented somehow from\nseeing the work through to its proper conclusion.\n INTERIOR (plan, fig. 64.2; sections, figs. 64.7 and 64.8)\n\nThe domed interior is 2.91m square and the floor level now\nstands 1.73m above the esplanade of the Haram. The base\nstorey is 5.30m high, the transition zone 2.02m high and the\ndome 3.32m high. The total height of the interior is therefore\n10.64m.\n\nIn the internal sills of each of the main windows are two\ncircular openings (fig. 64.2). Underneath these openings are\nwater troughs. There is a bronze ring between the holes at the\nnorth and west windows. It is said that cups (two per window)\nwere chained to these rings.\'* Wooden planks in the middle of\nthe floor of stone slabs (fig. 64.2) cover another trough which\nhas now been partly filled with sand and houses a water-tap.\n\nThe window jambs are of ablaq construction with a\nnarrow (0.12m) red stone band extending upwards to frame\nthe decoratively carved limestone spandrels of the internal\nablaq pointed arch over each window. A shallow disk 0.13m in\ndiameter is cut into the stone above the keystone of each of the\nthree arches (fig. 64.7). The recessed tympanums of these\narches (i.e. the back of the external joggled ablag lintels) are\nplastered.\n\nThe well-recess is situated in the east side to the north of\nthe entrance. The well and door recesses, contained by an\nablaq wall (fig. 64.8) are spanned by flat arches composed of\nthree stones elaborately carved with star-pattern strapwork in\nrelief (plate 64.8), similar to ones in the Ashrafiyya. Over these\n flat arches are two joggled relieving arches separatee Dy 4 ol te\npanel of strapwork. Continuing upwards we find a plain\nlimestone panel surrounded by a red stone frame (fig. 64.8)\nmodelled at each end in a fashion similar to the external\ninscription tabulae. There is no trace of an inscription on this\ninternal panel.\n\nAred stone band borders the upper end of the walls of the\nsquare room immediately below muqarnas pendentives. This\ndevice of providing in the interior the transition from the\nsquare room to the round base of the dome consists of six tiers,\nexpanding upwards from one niche at the lowest level to six\nniches at the highest (figs. 64.7 and 64.8). The pendentives are\nseparated by the pointed-arched clerestorey windows set in a\nframe of arabesque (not shown on the sections; see plate 64.9).\nA haphazard array of wooden beams now spans the space\nbetween these windows and supports a metal hook probably\nintended for the attachment of a lamp chain. The whole of the\nzone of transition is ornamented with an elaboration of relief\ncarving. A simple moulding separates the transition zone from\nthe dome. In a few places there are traces indicating that the\ninterior of the dome was at one time whitewashed and painted\nwith an artificially regularized network of courses and vertical\njoints. At the apex is an ablaq medallion consisting of a central\ncircular red stone surrounded by a cream-coloured limestone\nborder carved with lozenge and spear-shaped reliefs radiating\nfrom the centre.\n\nSEQUENCE OF CONSTRUCTION AND RESTORATION\nThe inscription around the exterior of the sabil (see above)\ncommemorates three phases of construction: first, the original\ndomed sabil of Sultan Inal; second, Sultan Qéaytbay’s\n‘restoration’ in 887/1482; and finally, the restoration by Sultan\n‘Abd al-Hamid in 1300/1883. We must now ask ourselves (1) is\nthere any trace of Inal’s original dome? (2) How much of\nQaytbay’s construction remains? (3) What is the extent of the\nsubsequent restorations? The existing structure has the\nappearance of a homogeneous whole, which suggests that its\noverall design dates from one particular period. There. is\nnothing in the present lower courses of the masonry of the\nsabil to question Mujir al-Din’s statement that Inal’s gubba was\ncompletely destroyed. Mujir al-Din’s description leads us also\nto believe that the floor ‘paved in marble’ must have been lifted\nat some time, probably during the Ottoman period. The\npresent stone floor is therefore a later replacement.\n\nFrom the evidence contained in the inscription it is clear\nthat there was no major restoration between Qaytbay’s original\n foundation and ‘Abd al-Hamid’s repairs of 1883. Therefore\nearly photographs might help us to identify those parts, in\naddition to the inscription, which are not original. Only a\nhandful of pre-1883 illustrations’” is available but those that do\nexist confirm that the restorations of 1883 took the form of\nrepairs rather than any major remodelling of the structure.\nHowever, the Ordnance Survey photograph cited in note 15\nshows the lintel of the north window decorated with star-\npattern strapwork; the present joggled ablag lintels of the three\nprincipal windows and their plastered interior faces may,\ntherefore, all be replacements datable to 1883. At the same time\nthe step to the door and the north and west windows were\nreconstructed. The window grilles are Ottoman in part at least.\nThe cement coating to the top of the dome was almost certainly\npart of the 1883 repairs, while the painted coursing on the\ninterior of the dome, evidently applied in an effort to disguise\nthe unevenness of the stonework, is only presumably so.”°\n\nThe next piece of evidence we have at our disposal is the\nphotographs taken in the 1920s by Creswell. These show that\nthe sabil was almost identical then to what it is now. But a few\nminor differences are discernible. The finial faced south-west\nto north-east rather than east-west as now. Also, the south-west\ncolumn base was badly chipped. In fact this damaged base lies\namongst the architectural debris scattered around the Islamic\nMuseum on the Haram and so presumably it was removed and\nreplaced by the present one after 1920.\"” Severe erosion of the\nfifth and sixth courses above the base of the north-eastern\ncorner shaft may be seen in a photograph of the east facade.\nThese stones have since been replaced. A deterioration in the\nprecision of the strapwork design on these two units, and on\nseveral parts of the south-eastern corner shaft, serves to\nconfirm the originality of the others. Likewise parts of the\nmoulding over the door are carved differently from the rest.\"®\nHowever, the 1920 photographs show a slight difference in the\ncolour of these stones, and suggest that they were part of the\n1883 repairs. Missing circular links in the lower half of the\nvertical moulding at the east end of the north side imply a\nrepair after the restoration of 1883. The absence today of cracks\nin the masonry of the transition zone, shown in Creswell’s\nphotographs, further evidences some post-1920 repairs.\n\nThus we may conclude that in form the sabil stands today\nvirtually as it was built in 1482. There is no visible trace of Inal’s\noriginal construction, and the restorations of 1883 — apart from\nthe window lintels — and the repairs after 1920 did little to\nmodify the original design.\n 1 Much of the present description of this building, including history and\narchitecture as well as the drawings, is taken from an article by C. Kessler and M.\nBurgoyne, ‘The Fountain of Sultan Qaytbay in the Sacred Precinct of Jerusalem’,\nArchaeology in the Levant: Essays for Kathleen Kenyon, ed. R. Moorey and P.

The epigraphic style strongly resembles that of\ninscriptions found in the Fakhriyya (no. 22) and the Qubbat al-Mi\'raj (built 593/\n1200-1, refurbished 1195/1781), which van Berchem (CIA (Haram), 55-56, 133)\n supposed to belong to the sixth/twelfth century.\n\n12 The sloping sides of these buttresses would have the advantage of shedding\nwater directly into the gutter below.\n\n13 C.

Once again a proliferation of Golden Henbane and Syrian Golden Drop\nis beginning to break up the fabric of the sabil. Recently scaffolding has been\nerected around the sabil with a view to repairing the stonework.\n\n17 Also in the debris around the Museum lies a single carved stone evidently\nintended to replace’ the badly eroded neck below the capital of the north-west\nshaft but for some reason never fitted.\n\n18 It should be observed that the carving of specific groups of architectural\nornament by obviously different hands does not necessarily indicate a restoration.\nUndoubtedly, several masons, each with his own cutting style, would have been\nemployed in the construction of the sabil.\n ','EXTERIOR, SEQUENCE');

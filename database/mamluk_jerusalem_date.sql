The Haram\ndocuments are, as far as can be seen, quite silent concerning it.\nA Hanafi qadi, Muhammad b. ‘Imran, in an endowment deed\ndated to the year 916/1511, made a list of the beneficiaries from\nthe property he instituted as wagf.~\" In this list, after his son and\nhis mother, we find the bawwab of Kurt’s hospice, the Shaykh,\nthe hospice residents (ujawirs), and then the Muslim poor\ngenerally, all these in descending priority. This suggests that the\nhospice was still functioning in some fashion right at the end of\nthe Mamluk period.\n Asali quotes from a later sijill, dated 1055-56/1645-46,” to\nlist repairs at an estimated cost of sixty piastres carried out on\n‘part of the vault of the lower iwdn . . . its eastern wall .. . the\ndividing wall between the hospice and the Jawhariyya Madrasa,\nand the roof of the hospice and the two kitchens, etc.’ He also\nremarks on the ‘partial collapse’ of the building as a result of\nIsraeli excavations in 1971. The building i is at present occupied\nby members of the al-Shihabi family.”° In 962/1555 an inventory was made of the belongings of a\nwoman who died ‘while a resident (mujawira) in the Women’s\nHospice in the Bab al-Hadid’.”’ It is not clear exactly which\ninstitution is intended. There is no reason at all to believe that\nKurt\'s Hospice was reserved for women. Other texts refer to a\n‘Hospice of the Sultan’ in the quarter of Bab al-Hadid (see pp.\n131, 343 n. 6, and 557).\n STREET FRONTAGE (fig. 7.5) The present street frontage is three storeys high, but only the\nlowest storey belongs to the Ribat of Kurt al-Mansiri. The\nmiddle storey was added in 844/1440 with the adjoining\nconstruction of the Jawhariyya Madrasa (no. 58) as shown by\nthe continuity of the masonry. There is a slight bend in the street\nalignment corresponding to the junction between the ribat and\nthe later madrasa (fig. 7.3). The lateral extent and the height of\nthe ribat may also be seen in a horizontal quirked ogee\nmoulding, which must originally have formed a cornice as the\nwater spout near the middle of the moulding, implying a roof\nbehind, shows (plate 7.1). The diminutive entrance doorway (plate 7.2) is set in a\nshallow recess with a slightly stilted pointed arch at the eastern\nend of the frontage, next to Bab al-Hadid. The usual stone\nbenches flanking the doorway have been built up at some time\n after 1920 when Creswell’s photograph (plate 7.2) was taken. A\nrelieving arch over the lintel is composed of three voussoirs\nwith rebated joints, and above, in the tympanum of the arched\nrecess, a small window (now blocked) is discernible. In the western part of the frontage an irregular half-arch,\naround which the stonework is recessed two or three\ncentimetres, is obviously a later repair (plate 7.1). The apex of\nthis half-arch coincides with the abutment of a relatively\nmodern strainer arch spanning the street at this point to\nbuttress the frontage against the Arghtiniyya Madrasa opposite.\nFrom the presence of a lintel stone and the disposition of the\nmasonry below it (fig. 7.5), it appears that there was once a\nwindow in the western half of the frontage intended to light the\nmain hall of the ribat (see plan, fig. 7.3).\n INTERIOR (jig. 7.3) (@) The southern structures The entrance doorway opens into a long passage (plate 7.3)\nwhich runs north into a small yard open to the sky, from which\nan archway on the west (now partly blocked) leads into a cross-\nyaulted antechamber to the main hall of the ribat lying to the\nwest of the passage. The doorway to the main hall is placed\neccentrically in the south wall of the antechamber, it is\nunremarkable apart from the unusual feature of flanking stone\nbenches on the inside.”® The corners of the hall are extruded in\norder to reduce the span of the cross vault. In the middle of the\nhall there is a buttress (see fig. 7.3) which was added later; its\nfunction, to support the floor above, is further confirmation\nthat the first floor is a later addition, as indicated by the masonry\nof the frontage. Above the entrance passage there is a low narrow room\n(dotted lines on plan, fig. 7.3) originally reached by a staircase\nin the thickness of the wall separating the passage from the\nmain hall. This is now blocked and the room is accessible only\nby climbing through a window in its north wall. There was a\nsecond small window at the south end of the room, looking out\nabove the entrance portal. The ceiling of the room is at the\nsame level as that of the main hall. Its different alignment and lack of structural integration\nshow that the antechamber is a later addition to the main hall.\n(ii) Courtyard\nFrom the small yard beside the antechamber a passageway\n leads northward to the courtyard of the ribat. On either side of\nthe passageway are groups of structures of a later date than the\nmain hall. Those on the west side, reached by a door in the\nnorth wall of the antechamber, are too dilapidated and overlaid\nwith debris for their period to be established. From the quality\nof the stone dressing, both they and the antechamber appear to\nbe pre-Ottoman and could well form part of the Jawhariyya\nadditions made in 844/1440 (p. 562). To the east of the\npassageway and against the Haram wall are two cells (marked\n‘B’ and ‘C’ on the plan) with doors (both blocked) in the north\nand south walls respectively. Six out of nine pointed arches in\nthese later additions have the unusual feature of a median joint\n(plate 7.4). Several arches in the Jawhariyya share this feature. The courtyard is dominated by the high wall of the Haram\n(see below) which forms its east boundary. The original west\nboundary is indeterminate: the lower part of the present wall is\nburied under a heap of rubble (plate 7.5). It seems very likely\nthat the original west boundary was in line with the west wall of\nthe main hall. (iti) Northern structures At the north end of the courtyard the buildings have no direct\nstructural connection with those parts of the ribat that confront\nthe street. This lack of connection and the absence of distinctive\narchitectural features make it very difficult to determine which\nparts may belong to the original ribat. To make matters worse,\nmany of the structures at ground level are now sealed off and\ninaccessible. Nevertheless, certain elements are manifestly\nOttoman and by eliminating these we can reduce the number\nof possible components of the ribat. At the north end of the courtyard is an zwvdan composed of\ntwo vaults, of which the outer one facing the courtyard (plate\n7.6) is higher and, like the structure it supports, is obviously\nOttoman. The priority of the inner vault upon which the outer\nvault abuts is indisputable. The stonework of the inner vault is\ndressed in a manner similar to that of the street frontage and we\nbelieve that this zwvdém forms part of the original construction.\nThere were two blocked openings in the rear (north) wall; both\nare blocked now. During repairs made in 1971-72 these\nopenings were unblocked briefly (see plate 7.7), but the\nheavily plastered walls and vaults of the chamber thus revealed\nbetrayed no distinctive characteristics. However, the vaulted\nceiling is somewhat lower than that of the zwdn (see fig. 7.6)\nand this leads us tentatively to suggest that this northern\nchamber is earlier, possibly connected with the Ayyubid\n structures to the north which come between the Mansuri Ribat\nand the Haram wall (above, p. 132). There are two openings in the west wall of the inner vault\nof the zvdn. The northern one is blocked and remained so\nduring the aforementioned repairs; nothing is known of the\narea beyond. The one to the south houses a staircase leading to\nthe upper floor. At the head of the staircase (plate 7.8) there are two\npassages which lead (a) west to connect ultimately with the roof\nof the Ribat al-Manstri and (b) east (plate 7.9) into a much-\npartitioned yard overshadowed by the Haram wall to the east\nand a three-storey Ottoman addition to the north (see fig. 7.6).\nFrom their architectural relationship, the zwan, the staircase\nand the small room immediately to the north of it at first floor\nlevel as well as the cross-vaulted room directly over the inner\nvault of the 7wan may be contemporaneous, i.e. be part of the\noriginal ribat. Other rooms at first floor level may also belong\nto the ribat but the anonymity of the architecture precludes\npositive identification. At second and third floor levels the\narchitecture is easily identified as Ottoman in its entirety (plate\n7.10).'),(8,'695','1295','','The inscription is dated ‘the commencement of the year 695\n[late 1295).4 Mujir al-Din repeats the same date, but it is more\nthan likely that he merely echoes the inscription. However, he\nalso tells us that he saw a copy of ‘Alam al-Din Sanjar’s waqfiyya,\nthe date of which was 7 Rabi‘ I 696/3 January 1297. The discrepancy of a little over a year between the date of\nthe inscription and the reported date of the waqf document\ndoes not admit of a single confident explanation. One could\n claim that the inscription, which refers to what is manifestly a\nsummary of the endowment deed, must have been executed\nafter the date of that deed (696/1297). Why then was the\ninscription dated 695/1295? Is that the date of the\ncommencement, rather than the more usual completion date?\nWas the inscription added a while after the completion of the\nbuilding? Or was there more than one act of endowment?\n PUL LEN\nThe founder may be styled in full the Amir ‘Alam al-Din Abu\nMisa Sanjar b. ‘Abdallah al-Burunli al-Turki al-Salihi al-Najmi\nal-Dawadari.

Mujir al-Din wrote:\n AL-Manjakiyya He [ie. Manjak] was ordered to reside in Jerusalem as\ntarkban. He came to the city in Safar 761 [December 1359-\nJanuary 1360]. In a certain history [it is written that] ‘He\ncame to Jerusalem to build the madrasa for the Sultan al-\nMalik al-Nasir Hasan’. It was his intention to build it for\nhim, but when the Sultan was killed in the year 762 [1361],\nhe built it for himself and it took his name. He endowed\nthe madrasa and provided it with students of law (fugaha’)\nand other personnel.° The ‘certain history’, which Mujir al-Din quotes, offers a\nmore circumstantial framework for the commencement of the\nmadrasa. The passage might be taken to mean that al-Nasir\nHasan initially planned the madrasa in Jerusalem, which is very\nplausible in view of his many other foundations in his second\nreign (755-62/1354-61), including madrasas in Hebron, Tripoli\nand Aleppo, not to mention his magnificent madrasa in Cairo.\nThere is a slight problem. If Manjak was sent to take\nresponsibility for the Sultan’s madrasa, he cannot be said to\nhave chosen Jerusalem for his tarkban residence. Yet the\nchoice of place of residence was his. The Sultan’s order (tawq?)\nis quoted by Ibn Khatib al-Nasiriyya from Ibn Habib’s history\nunder the year 761, including this sentence: ‘Thus it has been\nordered that the aforementioned should be tarkhan, residing\nwherever he wishes’.’ The text quoted by Mujir al-Din does not\nactually say that he was ordered to build by the Sultan. One\ncould understand that Manjak was acting on his own initiative,\nplanning to win the favour of the Sultan by building the\nmadrasa in the Sultan’s name.’ Mujir al-Din does not give a clear date for the\ncommencement or the completion of the Manjakiyya Madrasa.”\nNu‘aymi (d. 927/1521), who wrote later than Mujir al-Din,\nplaces the construction of Manjak’s ‘khangah and madrasa’ in\nJerusalem during his period of residence there.!° But is this\nbased on any independent evidence? If one considers the date\nof the endowment, which presupposes the completion of the\nbuilding, then there is again some lack of clarity. The two late\nsixteenth-century land registers available provide conflicting\ndates for the wagfiyya of Manjak. No. 522 gives 770/1368-69,!!\nand no. 602 773/1371-72.\'2 However, there is some sense in\naccepting dates of about that period, since, as we shall see,\nManjak became governor of Damascus for the second time in\n769/1368 and remained there for six years. If we accept that the\nerection of the madrasa was begun, and even completed, in the\nperiod 761-62/1360-61, Manjak’s immediate participation in the\nrevolt against Yalbugha and his subsequent five and half years’\nimprisonment could have spelt the temporary eclipse of his\nfoundation, which would have needed re-endowment on his\nreturn to power and affluence.\"'),(36,'762','1361','','Soon after Jumada I 762/March 1361 Taz was allowed to reside\nin Jerusalem in retirement.

May God bless our\nLord Muhammad and his family.\n FOUNDER The founder named in the above inscription was described by\nMujir al-Din as ‘one of the courtiers (khawéass) of the Sultan al-\nMalik al-Ashraf Qaytbay’. In another source we find him called\nMuhammad b. ‘Umar, commonly known as Ibn al-Zamin, and\ndescribed as ‘the agent (wakil) and merchant (tajir) of the\nsultan’? He makes a few appearances in the chronicles,\nexclusively as a person commissioned by the sultan to carry out\ncertain buildings projects. In 878/1473-74 the Sultan Qaytbay was informed of repair\nworks that were needed in the Prophet’s Mosque. Shams al-Din\nMuhammad, who by that date had already built in Medina a\nmadrasa called the Zamaniyya, was entrusted with the task. He\ncame to Medina during 879/1474-75, made the necessary\narrangements and then returned to Egypt. Shams al-Din\nMuhammad was later commissioned to do further work there.\nHe came from Jedda to Medina in Jumada I 881/August-\nSeptember 1476 and stayed to oversee things personally.° This\nwas the year in which own ribat in Jerusalem was completed. In\n882/1477-78 Shams al-Din Muhammad was involved in a\ndisturbing incident in Medina, where he had been asked to\nacquire a site for the construction of a madrasa for Qaytbay. He\nhad taken over the house of a Shi‘ite to incorporate it into the\nnew madrasa. The qadi, who allowed the demolition of the\nhouse, was murdered. Ibn lyas was on pilgrimage that year and\nwitnessed these events.” The story is told differently (with no\nmention of the dispute which ended in the murder of the qadi),\nand an Amir Sunqur al-Jamali is named as intendant of the\nworks, by the historian, Qutb al-Din al-Nahrawali.® The latter\nadds that the madrasa and a separate ribat too were completed\nin 884/1479-80 by that same amir. In 885/1480 Qaytbay ordered the repair of the Imam al-\nShafi\'i’s Mausoleum in Cairo and appointed Shams al-Din\nMuhammad to be the intendant (shaidd) of the works.’ The next\nyear, 886/1481, he was sent by the sultan to Medina once more\nto effect a major re-building of the Holy Mosque, which had\nbeen seriously damaged by a fire caused by lightning. He took\nwith him a number (some three hundred) of masons,\ncarpenters and workers in marble. The whole Operation was\nnot finished until the end of 887/early 1483 and cost the sultan\nabout 100,000 dinars.\" The intendant is also said to have been\nJamal al-Din Sunqur al-Jamali, who was at that time engaged on building work in Mecca! Under the year 897 Ibn Iyas gives the\nfollowing short notice:!2\n In Dhi\'l-Qa‘da [September-October 1492] there came\nfrom Mecca news of the death of the Khwaja Shams al- ie\nMuhammad b. al-Zamin. He was a notable merchant,\nknown for his great wealth, and a man of piety and\nbeneficence. He was the founder of the madrasa in Bulaq\'@\nnear the embankment (al-Rasif), a good and religious\nman, in whom there was no harm. The comprehensive entry given in  al-Sakhawi’s\nbiographical dictionary’ confirms and amplifies what has been\ngiven above. Shams al-Din Muhammad b. ‘Umar b. al-Zamin al-\nQurashi al-Shafi‘T was born in Damascus in 824/1421, where he\ndid his early studies, and then followed his father into\ncommerce. His travels took him to Asia Minor and into the\nBalkans, as far as Semendira (Semendria), when it was still a\nChristian possession.\'° He acquired a house in Egypt, and\nhaving established an intimacy with Qaytbay, upon the latter\'s\naccession to the sultanate, was appointed overseer of building\nprojects in Mecca. He had earlier performed a pilgrimage in\n844/1441, and lived in Mecca on several different occasions. A\nson, called Jamal al-Din Muhammad, whose mother was a slave-\ngirl, was born in Mecca in Muharram 883/April 1478.\'’ Also\nresident in Mecca was a nephew, Ibrahim b. ‘Abd al-Karim b.\n‘Umar, who later married a daughter of Shams al-Din. It is\ninteresting to note that he too travelled in commerce, but\neastwards to the Malabar Coast. On the death of his uncle he\ncame back but then ‘returned with the seasonal convoy to\nDabhol’.\'® Shams al-Din’s death followed several months of\n illness contracted in Mecca, where he had travelled to perform\nthe pilgrimage in 896/1491. He returned to Cairo in a litter and\ndied almost on his arrival, Sunday, 18 Shawwal 897/12 August\n1492. The next day he was buried in his mausoleum.'),(62,'885','1480-81','','FOUNDER ; The foundation of this institution was the work of the one-time\nhead of the Chancery Bureau (diwédn al-insha’) in Cairo, Zayn\nal-Din Abii Bakr b.

Both were called ‘al-\nNabulusi’, for the family seems to have originated from\nNablus.° A Haram document dated 784/1382 contains the\ntestament of a man described as ‘one of the Muzhir clan of\nNablus’.’ Abt Bakr’s grandfather, Badr al-Din Muhammad b.\nAhmad, was twice head of Chancery (Ratib al-sirr) in Damascus.\nHe died in Jerusalem in Dhi’l-Qa‘da 793/October 1390.8\nAnother Haram document,’ dated that very same month,\nauthorized the sale of five slaves and a mule on behalf of his\norphan children.

He had been\nborn in Damascus in 786/1384-85, and followed in the career\nfootsteps of his father, but moved to Cairo and became head of\nthe Chancery there as a result of his association with the Sultan\nal-Mu’ayyad Shaykh, established when the latter was still\ngovernor in Damascus. It was in Cairo that Abt Bakr was born, in Rajab 831/April-\nMay 1428.\'! He was orphaned at a young age when his father\ndied on Saturday, 26 Jumada II 832/2 April 1429.\'? His father\nwas immediately succeeded as head of the Chancery by another\nson, yet another Muhammad, known as Jalal al-Din, but in\noffice, as Badr al-Din like his father and grandfather. For this\nappointment he paid 90,000 or 100,000 dinars from his father’s\nestate, but was soon replaced and made secretary to the sultan’s\nson.” Still not yet twenty, he died in Rajab 833/April 1430.4 Abt Bakr studied all the main Shafi\'l law texts with the\nleading Shafit scholars, and gained his professional\nadministrative skills through association with the top officials of\nthe day, including his guardian, Zayn al-Din ‘Abd al-Basit (see p.\n519). His own career proceeded at a measured pace. He\neventually became head of the Chancery in 866/1462” and held\nthe post until his death. He came to Nablus in early 893/spring\n1488 to raise troops for an expedition against the Ottomans,\nand had hoped to visit Jerusalem but fell ill, and returned to\nCairo,!° where he died on Thursday, 6 Ramadan 893/14 August\n1488.\" The next day he was buried in the mausoleum he had\nbuilt in the Qarafa cemetery. He had visited Jerusalem and Hebron ‘time after time’, and\nhad performed the pilgrimage to Mecca ‘more than once’. Two\npublic fountains (sabilayn) had been erected by him in Mecca\nand a ribat and a madrasa in Medina. At Cairo he was the\n founder of a fine madrasa ‘near his house’ in the Birjawan\ndistrict, which was completed probably in 884/1479-80, that is,\nabout the same time as the building of his madrasa in\nJerusalem.\'* The Cairo madrasa was established, as al-Sakhawi\ntells us, to hold a SGfi community and to provide courses of\nstudy in Koranic exegesis, the Tradition of the Prophet, and\njurisprudence and other unspecified matters. May one assume\nthe same for the Jerusalem foundation? Al-Sakhawi wrote,\n‘Likewise he erected a small madrasa (madrasa latifa) in\nJerusalem’. After his death he too was succeeded in the office of head\nof the Chancery by a son, a fourth Badr al-Din Muhammad.!?\nSome years later another son, Kamal al-Din Muhammad, took\nover that position but only for a few months.’ In 910/1504 Badr\nal-Din was arrested and died after dreadful torture 2! A further\nson committed suicide rather than face what he feared from the\nsultan, and then, to complete the deaths of three sons of Aba\nBakr within the space of one year, Kamal al-Din died of plague\nin Ramadan 910/February 1505.22\n ENDOWMENT A brief note in the Ottoman defter no. 602 attributes to the waqf\nof the Muzhiriyya in Jerusalem one half of the village of Bayt\nSahir al-Wadi, valued there at 1,250 aspers, and also the Khan\nof the Bani Sa‘d and its lands.

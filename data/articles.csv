1,"Il SITE AND BUILDING
","Herod’s temple enclosure (the lines of which are followed by
the present walls of the Haram, see above, p. 44) included
porticoes on all four sides. Nothing of these porticoes survives
except for a regular series of beam sockets cut at a height of
8.9m above the level of the Haram esplanade into the rock
scarp at the west end of the northern boundary. The Herodian
porticoes were destroyed by Titus in A.D.70 (see above, p. 44).

By the fourth/tenth century new vaulted porticoes had
been erected along the west and north borders of the Haram
(see above, p. 46); of these nothing now survives apart from a
regular series of a dozen sockets for vaulting springers about
5.9m below the Herodian beam sockets in the rock scarp. The
average span between the centres of the sockets is 3.89m. These
sockets certainly antecede the Mamluk portico which sustains
the Is‘ardiyya (see below) for they continue empty and
redundant in the rock face under that building.

Shortly after the Muslim reconquest of Jerusalem from the
Crusaders in 583/1187 there began a process of restoring the
Haram (see above, p. 48), which included the construction in
610/1213-14 of the middle part of the north portico. This
portico was subsequently completed by the Mamliks. The
various steps in that complex process are analysed below.

Ill HISTORY

Al-‘Umari (¢.745/1345) described the north wall of the Haram
and its gates thus:

The first of [the gates] is on the eastern side, a gate called
Bab al-Asbat. Adjoining it is the above-mentioned portico
which forms the end of the eastern wall .. .!

On the west side adjacent to this gate is a vaulted portico
having ten piers . . . Its [north] facade has four windows
overlooking the Birkat Bani Isra’il, an ancient and deep
pool.

Adjacent to this portico is an open space through part of
which flows water to the Birkat Bani Isra’il. Part of it is an
open space upon which it was intended to build porticoes,
but up till now they have not been completed...

Adjacent to this land is the Karimiyya Madrasa (no. 15).
It has enclosed the portico in front of it with two walls, one
to the west and another to the east, and two ‘summer
chambers’ have been made before it. . .

Adjacent to the madrasa is a gate called Bab Hitta... In
front of it is a walkway paved with flagstones ... On either
side of the gate are two little benches, each 2 dhira “(1.4m)
wide, the eastern one abutting on the above-mentioned
Karimiyya Madrasa and the western one adjacent to a
 portico ... in its wall there are three windows of the Ribat
of ‘Alam al-Din al-Dawadar (no. 8). Commencing from the
east there is a window opening on the Turba ofal-Awhad al-
Ayyabi (no. 9).

Abutting on this portico is a gate known as Bab Sharaf al-
Anbiya’ . . . In front of the latter is a walkway similar to the
one mentioned above...

Abutting on this gate is a vaulted portico ... having eight
piers. At the beginning of it are two windows, one of them
open [that is, ungrilled] through which is reached the
Zawiya of the Vizier Amin al-Din, Iknown as Amin al-Mulk
(no. 21). Adjacent to both of them is a door through which
the Zawiyat al-Lawi is entered. Beside the gate is a platform
with a cistern.

This portico is adjoined on the west by another having
two vaults resting on three piers... a few women here say
the five prayers behind the zmam. Above this portico is the
Madrasa of the Amir Sayf al-Din al-Hajj Almalik al-Jakandar
(no. 26) and the Khanqah of Majd al-Din al-Is‘ardi (no. 33)
the merchant. At the beginning of it near the cistern which
I have mentioned are the steps which lead up to the
madrasa and the khanqah.

Adjacent to this portico is an open space on which there
are no porticoes. It is in the shape of a high platform
through the middle of which one goes down by six steps
to the Haram. At the highest point of this wall five windows
of the Madrasa of the Amir ‘Alam al-Din Sanjar al-Jawili
(no. 14)... There is no way to it from the Haram. At the end
of this open space towards the west are two cells, each
having a door opening to the south on the Haram. The
interior of both is entirely inside the north wall, and they
are [cut in] the solid rock like caves. It is said that they were
known of old as the Cave of Abraham. In the eastern one
is a small window. At the side of these two cells is the cell
of the Shaykh of the Haram with two windows facing the
Haram. Above this cell is another cell, to which one
ascends by a flight of seven steps to the edge of the door
Opening east. ;

Adjacent is a portico with two arches . . . Next to it isa
very long stairway from the top of which a minaret is
ascended as well as a house belonging to the Bani Jama‘a
family. This minaret (no. 10) is at the farthest point of the
west wall of the Haram.”

Wit leraleslelinnaicices docamiaiim nic ammanlcoanceened wunth the
 topography of the Haram borders, Mujir al-Din is more
interested in chronicling the history of their construction:

As for the northern porticoes (arwiqa), they extend from
east to west from Bab al-Asbat to the Jawiliyya Madrasa,
which is known nowadays as Dar al-Niyaba (see below, p.
205). Concerning the portico which occupies all the space
between Bab al-Asbat and the Ghadiriyya Madrasa (no. 54),
I have not been able to discover the period of its
construction, but circumstances indicate that it was built at
the same time as the minaret there (no. 38), built during
the reign of the al-Ashraf Sha‘ban b. Husayn in 769/1367-68
[but see below]. The portico below the Ghadiriyya was
built at the same time as this madrasa, and similarly the
assembly hall of the Karimiyya.

As for the portico extending from Bab Hitta to Bab al-
Duwaydariyya [Bab al-‘Atm], it appears that it was built by
al-Malik al-Awhad with his Turba, which is at Bab Hitta, for
certain clauses in its endowment necessitate that
[interpretation].

The portico extending from Bab al-Duwaydariyya to the
west end supports five madrasas. Part of it — that is under
the Aminiyya Madrasa and Farisiyya Madrasa (no. 30)—was
ancient. It was later reconstructed in the reign of al-
Mu‘azzam ‘Isa in the year 610/1213-14. The remainder,
which is under three madrasas — the Almalikiyya, the
Is‘ardiyya and the Subaybiyya (no. 51) — is of the same
period of construction as them, each of them having been
built with the corresponding portico below. Inspection
shows that that is so and that the construction of each
madrasa corresponds with that of the portico under it...
and since the date of all the madrasas is given below, so the
date of construction of each of these sections of porticoes
under them is known.

As for the two porticoes that are under the Dar al-
Niyaba, they were built at the same time as the Ghawanima
Minaret (no. 10); inscribed on them is the date of their
construction and that of the minaret, but the inscription
has become eroded over a long time. In addition, these
two porticoes are surmounted by two others, a century
more recent. We will mention the time when the minaret
was constructed, which will allow an approximate idea of
the date of their construction. God knows best!
 The north portico is best described not according to the
chronological sequence of its construction but in
topographical order, starting from the east end, following al-
‘Umari and Mujir al-Din. In fig. 1.2 the piers supporting the
arches of the portico are numbered from 1 (east end) to 42
(west end); the bays will be numbered in this analysis in the
same order so that pier 1 is the pier immediately to the left
(west) of bay 1.

BAYS 1-11

The first eleven bays of the portico — along with the single bay
extending southwards from bay 1 against the east wall —appear
to be structurally and architecturally homogeneous, suggesting
that they belong to one period of construction. The exact date
of that construction is unknown. They are not later than c.745/
1345 when al-‘Umari described them. Evidently they do not
belong to the same series as the springers in the rock scarp at
the west end of the north wall since the ‘pitch’ (i.e. the distance
from one pier centre to the next) averages about 3.89m at the
rock scarp as opposed to a mean of 5.28m here at the east end
of the portico. In appearance they seem to be pre-Crusader,
however. They contain no stones with Crusader tooling or
masons’ marks as one would expect in Crusader construction
or in re-use in Ayyubid and early Mamlik construction (as in
bays 21 —23 and 31 —35, for example; see below), and they bear
no resemblance to the west portico of the Haram, which is
 wholly Mamluk. Rather they may be associated with the
Ikhshidid rebuilding of part of the east wall of the Haram
beside Bab al-Asbat in 350/961-62,4 or with the Fatimid
restorations in the Haram during the fifth/eleventh century.’

MINARET BAB AL-ASBAT (no. 38)

The minaret was built in 769/1367-68 partly on top of pier 11,
which forms the right-hand jamb of the minaret’s portal (see
below, p. 415).

BAYS 12-14

These bays are structurally and architecturally homogeneous.
Their date of construction is unknown. Bay 12 is built against
the base of the minaret in a manner clearly indicating the
priority of the minaret. To their west stands the Ghadiriyya
Madrasa, obviously built later than pier 14 against which it
abuts. These three bays must therefore be dated after 769/1367-
68, when the minaret was erected, and before 836/1432, when
the Ghadiriyya was built. An even closer terminus ante quem
for its construction is 800/1397 since that is the date before
which the Tultniyya Madrasa was built. According to Mujir al-
Din, one ascended from the stairway giving access to the
minaret to two Mamluk madrasas, the Tuliniyya and the
Fanariyya, both built before 800/1397-98, but neither of which
survives.° In his list of buildings given in topographical order
from west to east, Mujir al-Din places the Tultniyya between
the Ghadiriyya and the Fanariyya — presumably directly over
bays 12-14 of the portico.’

BAYS 16-19

These are structurally and architecturally homogeneous. They
are said by Mujir al-Din to have been built at the same time as
the Ghadiriyya in 836/1432.

THE KARIMIYYA (no. 15)

The Karimiyya, occupying the space between piers 19 and 20,
appears originally to have had its own portico of three bays
(below, p. 217). At some later time (perhaps at the same time as
the construction of the Ghadiriyya — see below, p. 217) the
portico was converted into the Karimiyya’s assembly hall,
which now stands here.

BAYS 21-23

These are structurally and architecturally homogeneous. Bay
21 in front of Bab Hitta has a fine corbel-table cornice made
mostly from re-used Crusader material (plate 1.1). The

 masonry of all three bays contains a large number of re-used
Crusader stones, many of them bearing masons’ marks. The
exact date of construction is not known. Mujir al-Din states that
the portico from Bab Hitta to Bab al-‘Atm appears to have been
built by al-Malik al-Awhad when he built his tomb, but
structural discontinuity in the portico between bays 23 and 24
and between bays 27 and 28 (see below) seem to indicate three
separate phases of construction between the two gates. Of
these, bays 21-23, in front of al-Awhad’s tomb, were most
probably built by him after he took office as Superintendent of
the Two Harams (694/1295) and before his endowment deed
was drawn up in 697/1298.

BAYS 24-28

The exact date of construction of these is unknown. Bay 24
abuts on pier 23 to the east and so they should be dated after it,
that is after 694/1295 (see above), and bay 27 abuts on pier 28
to the west, which is dated 610/1213-14 (see below). The mean
pitch of these bays 24—27 is about 4.37m whereas that of the
Ayyubid portico is about 4.65m. The extra width of the bay 28
is explained by the presence of an earlier window in the north
wall of the Haram at this point, which necessitated the
displacement of the northern vaulting springer of the portico to
clear it (see plan, fig. 8.3). Thus we may conclude that bays 24—
28 were built some time after 694/1295 and they must have
existed before 745/1345 when al-Umari described them.

It is possible that they were built along with the
Dawadariyya, which is situated immediately beyond the Haram
wall at this point. The Dawadariyya was completed on the first
day of 695/10 November 1295, approximately five months after
al-Awhad took up his post as Superintendent of the Two
Harams in Rajab 694/May-June 1295° and, therefore,
conceivably after he had built bays 21-23. It seems more likely,
however, that they belong to a second stage of al-Awhad’s
construction of the Haram portico since he would have had a
natural desire to fill the gap between bay 23 and bay 29 (which
is dated 610/1213-14; see below). If so, Mujir al-Din’s
interpretation of al-Awhad’s endowment deed becomes more
understandable. A shift in alignment between bays 23 and 24
(see plan, fig. 9.3) may be explained by the need to make this
portico connect with the Ayyibid portico (bays 29-38) to the
west, something that appears not to have influenced the
builders of bays 21-23. All these bays (21-28) have vertical
extensions to the piers, which continue upwards between the
arches to form buttresses with sloping tops, evidently in
emulation of the Ayyubid portico to the west.

BAYS 29-38
These appear to have belonged initially to one phase of
construction though they have subsequently undergone
various alterations. An inscription on pier 31 gives the date of
their construction: 610/1213-14.” The inscription uses the word
juddida, signifying that the portico was a ‘renewal’, presumably
of the portico mentioned by fourth/tenth-century geographers,
of which only the sockets in the rock scarp to the west survive.
Since these bays 29-38 have a mean pitch of 4.65m there is little
doubt that nothing of the earlier portico remained to be
incorporated into this Ayyabid one. The ‘renewal’ was in fact a
replacement of the earlier portico. Mujir al-Din, following the
text of the inscription, states that the portico from the Bab al-
‘Atm under the Farisiyya, i.e. bays 31-35, is ancient and was
reconstructed under the rule of al-Malik al-Mu‘azzam ‘Isa. He
goes on to state that the remaining bays of the portico to the
west were built at the same time as the madrasas they support,
the Almalikiyya, the Is‘ardiyya and the Subaybiyya. This is
largely true but there is good reason to believe that the portico
under the Almalikiyya (bays 36-38) incorporates part of the
portico of al-Mu‘azzam ‘Isa (see below).

Bays 29 and 30 are structurally homogeneous with bay 31,
which is dated by the inscription of 610/1213-14 on its left-hand
pier. The left-hand pier of bay 29 has another inscription, also
from the time of al-Mu‘azzam ‘Isa, giving the dimensions of the
 Haram."" We can be sure, therefore, that bays 29-31 belong to
the same Ayyubid construction. The vertical extension of the
piers to form buttresses with sloping tops to shed rainwater is
a Crusader technique here used for the first time in Islamic
construction.

Bays 32-38 may also belong to this construction. Part of
pier 31 and all of pier 32 are concealed by a later staircase built
when the Aminiyya above them was converted to domestic use
some time in the Ottoman period. The position of pier 32 may
be deduced from the line of the vaulting groins of bay 32 (see
plan, fig. 21.3). Bays 33-35 under the Farisiyya have been
rebuilt, with only the spacing between the piers to show that
they may originally have belonged to the Ayyibid portico. The
piers project into the Haram about 0.70m more than piers 28—
31 of the Ayyubid portico. Bays 36 and 37 under the Almalikiyya
retain the spacing of the Ayyubid portico but also project about
0.70m to the south. It is impossible now to confirm that these
bays 33-37 were originally part of the Ayyubid portico. Yet pier
38 follows the alignment of the Ayyubid portico and is exactly
4.65m from the earlier part of pier 37, a dimension that
corresponds to the mean pitch of the Ayyubid portico, and so it
is likely that it does indeed belong to that earlier portico.
Consequently the piers between numbers 32 and 38 probably
also formed part of the Ayyabid portico but were rebuilt at
some later date. Piers 35 and 37 were enlarged at the time of the
construction of the Almalikiyya in 741/1340 to form the bases of
buttresses that extend upwards to flank its facade. At the same
time pier 36 was completely rebuilt.

The little arched opening between piers 38 and 39 shelters
a staircase built to give access to the Almalikiyya.

BAYS 40-42

These bays support the Is‘ardiyya. Bays 40 and 41 are
structurally and architecturally homogeneous. They belong to
the same period of construction as the building they support,
the Is‘ardiyya. The manner in which bay 42 abuts on pier 41
(fig. 1.3) shows that it belongs to a later phase of construction.
 Al‘Umari’s enumeration of the bays of the north portico ends
with bay 40, implying that while bays 39 and 40 existed in his
day, bay 41 had not yet been built (see below, p. 370).

WESTWARD CONTINUATION
Beyond the Is‘ardiyya there once stood a westward
continuation of the portico, evidently built at the same time as
 the Subaybiyya and giving access to it (see above, p. 515). Now
only traces of springings for its vaulting survive beside bay 42;

the portico itself has disappeared.

BAYS NO LONGER EXTANT
Towards the west end of the north wall there were two bays of

portico described by al-Umari and said by Mujir al-Din to have
 been built at the same time as the Minaret al-Ghawanima at the
end of the seventh/thirteenth century. They bore an inscription
giving the date of construction, but this was too badly worn to
be deciphered by Mujir al-Din. On top of that portico stood two
upper bays, built a century later. Nothing at all survives of these
porticoes.

Silsila and ‘Aqabat Aba Madyan, opposite the Kilaniyya (no. 29)
and the Taziyya (no. 36).
 "
2,"Il SITE AND BUILDINGS (fig. 2.2)
","The site is bounded by the street, Tariq Bab al-Silsila to the
north, by the lane ‘Aqabat Abi Madyan to the west and south-
west, by shops entered from Tariq Bab al-Silsila to the east, and
by various unrecorded structures to the south-east.

No less than five different phases of construction are
discernible in the present building. Of these, two are pre-
Mamlik and one is Ottoman. There are two Mamluk phases:
one is datable between 663/1265 and 679/1280, and the other is
dated by inscription 792/1390. The full extent of these
constructions is not known for only the facade on Tariq Bab al-
Silsila survives. The interior has been substantially remodelled,
evidently in the nineteenth century.
 In 1900 the building was converted into a library
comprising three distinct components: a small vaulted
chamber (chamber ‘A’) in the south-east corner of the complex;
a reading room at the west end of the complex; and, between
these two, a courtyard. This is the terminology we shall use in
the following analysis.

The reading room has a remarkable ‘Romanesque’
doorway (now a window) in its north facade belonging to the
earlier Mamluk period. To the east of that, the later Mamlak
work includes a large grilled window, a water trough and an
entrance portal that are built into two bays of a pre-Mamltk
arcade.

inscriptions commemorating Barka Khan and his two sons are
within the open courtyard, although not necessarily in their
original positions. Those of Barka Khan read as follows in the

significant passages:

_.. This is the tomb of the servant needful of God's mercy
and forgiveness, Barkatkhan [sic] (may God illumine his
resting-place). He died on Friday, the first day of
Muharram in the year 644 [18 May 1246]... ”

_.. This is the tomb of the one needful of God Almighty’s
mercy, Husam al-Din, prince of amirs, Barka Khan, who

FOUNDER :

The Amir Husam al-Din Barka Khan b. Dawlat Khan,’ after
whom the turba is named, was one of the four chiefs, and the
most important one, of the Khwarizmian bands who operated
in Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine in the 1230s and 1240s.
They were the remnants, no doubt of mixed ethnic origin, of
the army of the Khwarizm Shah, whose empire had been
shattered by the Mongols. After the death of Jalal al-Din, the son
of the last Khwarizm Shah, this soldiery became ever more a
threat to the economy and security of the area.’ The Ayyubid
Sultan al-Salih Ayyab had attempted to use them as an
instrument of his policy. He married a half-sister of his to Barka
Khan.’ In the end the power of the Khwarizmiyya was broken
in a battle south of Homs, which took place in Muharram 644/
May 1246. Barka Khan was killed by a mamluk of an Aleppan
amir — some say that he was decapitated and his head sent to
Aleppo, where it was displayed on the citadel gate.®

It is far from clear who actually built the tomb. Mujir al-Din
held that it was built after the death of Barka Khan, although his
opinion is weakened by the fact that he gives the date of
construction as 792/1390,? which as we shall see derives from
the inscription which records some restoration and new work
and was presumably Mujir al-Din’s source. The Ottoman Defter
602 lists a ‘waqf of Barka Khatiin (sic) in Tariq Bab al-Silsila in
the David Quarter.’!° There is no date given, and, even apart
from the mistake in the title (if it is indeed a mistake), it is very
easy to imagine that the waqf for the support of the tomb would
later acquire that name. The entry in the defter provides scant
evidence that Barka Khan had built, or begun, an endowed
tomb before his death.

The Sultan Baybars married a daughter of the dead
Khwarizmian leader, who became the mother of Barka Khan
Muhammad (b. 658/1260), the future Sultan al-Sa‘id.!’ Van
Berchem speculated that this daughter was the pious builder of
the tomb to honour her father. Such evidence as there is,
however, points towards her brother, Badr al-Din Muhammad
Bey, as being the founder.

Through the connection by marriage with Baybars, the
two sons of the Khwarizmian leader, Badr al-Din Muhammad
Bey and Husam al-Din Kara Bey, prospered. In 663/1264-5
Muhammad Bey received as his own property the village of
Dayr al-Ghustin, which was one part of recent coastal gains
from the Crusaders, distributed to his amirs by Baybars.’* This
is significant, because the Haram document no. 36 is concerned
with ‘the waqf of ...the late Badr al-Din b. Barka Khan in
Jerusalem, namely a mosque (masjid), tomb (turba), and the
village of Dayr al-Ghustin, and [provision for] the cure of the
sick and the preparing of the dead for burial in Jerusalem’, In
the absence of other evidence to the contrary, this is a strong
indication that Badr al-Din Muhammad Bey was the founder, if
we may legitimately understand the ‘turba’ to be the building
 that is our present concern. If, moreover, the mosque’ formed
part of the same complex, that too is a valuable item of
information. Badr al-Din died in Damascus, aged about 50, in
Rabi‘ I 678/October 1279. He was first of all buried at the foot
of Mount Qasyiin, but in the following year his corpse was
transferred to Jerusalem, where it was buried near his father’s
grave.""

DATE

There is little firm evidence to follow. If we accept Mujir al-
Din’s statement that the turba was built after the death of Barka
Khan, then we have as the earliest possible date the year 644/
1246. The latest possible date is 679/1280, since Muhammad
Bey was then moved to Jerusalem to lie ‘near his father’s grave’.
However, the memorial stone of the other son, Husam al-Din
Kara Bey, survives, giving the date of his death as 3 Dht’l-Hijja
661/8 October 1263.’ At what date is remains may have been
transferred to the turba in Jerusalem we cannot tell. He died
and was first buried, it seems, in Cairo.’° His death preceded by
a few years the date of the acquisition of the village that
eventually became part of Badr al-Din’s waqf (see above). If
one grants that the waqf of the village of Dayr al-Ghustin was
associated with the erection of the turba, then that could not
have been possible before the village became Badr al-Din’s
property. This would tentatively narrow the range of dates for
the building of the Barka Khan Turba to the years 663-679/1264-
1280.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

It is clear that substantial restoration or alterations, and also
work on associated waqf properties, were carried out at the end
of the fourteenth century. They are recorded in an extant
inscription’ (see below, p. 113).

It so happens that Haram document no. 36 has direct
relevance to the works here referred to. It was issued on the 7
Muharram 797/12 November 1394, and contains an instruction
from the Chief Qadi of Egypt, Badr al-Din Muhammad b. Abi'-
Baqa’, to the Qadi of Jerusalem, Sharaf al-Din ‘Isa b. Ghanim,
that he officially record the repairs, and their cost, carried out
by the n4zir of the waqf of Badr al-Din b. Barka Khan, and
afford him, as he requested, all support and consideration. The
nazir is named as ‘the senior amir, Nasir al-Din Muhammad b.
Timur al-‘Ala’’, surely the person who appears in the
inscription. Indeed, the document tells us that ‘he had repaired
the waqf and thereby rent was forthcoming, which could be
used for the charitable purposes of the waqf.’ Badr al-Din b.
Barka Khan is described as ‘the ancestor on his mother’s side’
of the Amir Nasir al-Din Muhammad, who exercised the office
of administrator (#azir) ‘according to the stipulations of the
founder (waqif)’.

In 1865 Sandreczki visited the site. There he found ‘a
school, and entering the courtyard in front of it, two tombs, the
inscriptions of which I copied . . . the one on the S[outh] side is
va Sy OO TS A ETO NIB TORO
 the tomb of Husam ad din [Barka Khan], who died in the year
of the Hijré 644; the other on the N. side is that of Badr ad din
al Barke Khan, who died in the y. of the H. 678. — From it the
place is called Al Barke Khan. — Next to this school (W) lies a
ruined mosque [on the site of the present reading room], which
is called Jami’ al Magharibé al Kadim.’®

The tomb became at a date unknown incorporated into
the residence of the Khalidi family in Jerusalem. In 1900 a
library of some 12,000 books and manuscripts was created by
the Shaykh Raghib al-Khalidi in what had been used as the
family mosque.’”
 "
2,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","STREET FACADE (fig. 2.4, plate 2.1)

Since the street facade is virtually all that survives of the pre-
Ottoman constructions on the site, our attention will focus on
it. In order to clarify the sequence of construction of the five
principal components that make up the present facade we shall
discuss each phase of construction individually.

@) First phase
This comprises the lowest courses of stones varying in height
from three courses at the east end of the facade to one course
under the east jamb of the reading room doorway. The stones
forming these courses are roughly squared and project about
0.08m further into the street than those of the rest of the facade.
These stones must be the remains of an earlier building on the
site. Some of them have been cut back in places, possibly at a
later date, to form shallow ledges whose purpose is not known.
Towards the middle of the facade the upper voussoirs and
keystone of a slightly pointed arch can be seen in Creswell’s
1920 photograph (plate 2.1). Part of the pavement beside this
arch was dug up to install a new sewer in 1982, allowing more
of the arch to be inspected. It appeared then that the stones
filling the arch are later insertions intended to block it; it is
impossible to say when this was done without archaeological
excavation. The arch itself may once have served to roof the
main aqueduct carrying water from ‘Solomon’s Pools’ to the
Haram, which turns east down Tariq Bab al-Silsila at about this
point.
(ii) Second phase
This is a series of archways that extend eastward from the
reading room. Piers supporting pointed arches rest on the
rough masonry foundation of the first phase. Three archways
survive although there may once have been one or two more to
the east. Originally open, they are now largely filled with later
work, the two western ones having been incorporated into the
turba complex (see below) and the eastern one divided into
two shops. Traces of partition walls on the inner (southern)
faces of the piers (plate 2.2) indicate that each of the archways
opened into a separate chamber, probably intended as a shop

Ee Pain AEH Pc ea AD Se ee a ii a my ete RR rm Yond Weve eid Mapes Rear at ey
 up the street, which are almost certainly Crusader.” To judge
from the stone dressing, the three belonging to phase (ii) are
also Crusader. Further indication of their Crusader origin may
be found in six curious circular shields, discussed below,
which are carved about shoulder height in the masonry of the
piers (shown in fig. 2.4).

The springers of the arches are set back about 0.10-0.15m
from the jambs of the piers below, thereby forming a ledge that
might have supported a beam spanning the archway. Attrition
of the blocking masonry in the tympanum of the western
archway has exposed a 0.01m square groove in the intrados of
the arch, 0.08m from the face, connecting sockets 0.07m square
and 0.03m deep at about 0.35m intervals. The groove and
sockets could have held a frame supporting timber boarding
(or something of that sort) in the tympanum. Such an
arrangement would allow the shops to be securely closed by
simple rectangular doors.

One course above the keystones of the archways a cavetto
cornice with a square downturn at its west end (see plate 2.1)
extends across the facade as far as the right-hand haunch of the
third (eastern) arch. Originally it would have continued further
east to include at least the third arch, but that section is now
missing as is a section above the middle arch where four
sculpted corbels have been inserted (see below).

The west pier of the arcade is wider than the others,
indicating that here was the west end of the arcade where any
residual lateral thrust from the vaults had to be accommodated.
It is pierced by a rectangular window which appears to be an
integral part of the original structure; the third course of
masonry above its lintel has been cambered as if to spread the
load onto the window jambs rather than the lintel. The height
of the sill, originally 0.89m above present street level, has been
raised 0.50m or so at some later date ( see fig. 2.4). Quite what
the purpose of this window was is hard to say. The east side of
its interior embrasure is straight but the west side skewed so as
to admit light to the reading room (see plan, fig. 2.3), and the
present east wall of the reading room is chamfered at its north
end to avoid blocking the window. If the west pier containing
the window originally extended back southwards to form the
west wall of the arcade, as traces of Crusader masonry in the
east wall of the reading room (plate 2.3) would appear to
 suggest, then we must assume that the window was then either
simply a recess cut into the pier or that it opened into a space
entered either from the archway to the east or from the lane to
the west. The purpose of such a recess or space can only be
guessed at, but it should be noted in this context that four of the
six circular shields on the facade are to be found on the jambs
of this window.

(iti) Third phase

This is the facade of the reading room, the main feature of
which is the Romanesque doorway (now a window) (figs. 2.7,
2.8). This facade abuts directly on the last pier of the arcade. A
straight vertical joint with only minor irregularities near the top
 defines the conjunction. Above the level of the doorway the
stonework of the facade is stepped in about 0.05m on either
side, one course higher at the west side than at the east side.
These steps in the masonry may indicate that the upper part of
the facade was rebuilt at some time. At a level one course above
the higher of the two steps a cavetto cornice, very similar in
profile to the one over the arcade, runs across the facade and
terminates in curved downturns at each end. The masonry
above this cornice belongs to the fifth, late Ottoman, phase and
supports the north end of a tiled monopitch roof over the
reading room.

The Romanesque doorway is placed off centre in this
facade ina manner which suggests that the door was positioned
to be on the central axis of the chamber it gave access to. In
other words, the pre-existing end wall of the arcade to the east
formed the east wall of the chamber and so its thickness is not
expressed on the facade, while the west wall was newly built
and its thickness accounts for the eccentricity of the facade.

The doorway is unusual but not unique in the architecture
of Jerusalem. A very similar (but undated) doorway that existed
—and may still exist — in the Old City in the vicinity of Bab al-
Sahira (Herod's Gate) is recorded in a photograph preserved in
the archives of the Palestine Archaeological (Rockefeller)
Museum (see plate 2.4). Both doorways have hoodmoulds
around an outer arch of gadrooned voussoirs enclosing an
inner chevron arch resting on elbow consoles (fig. 2.7). The
entrance to the Kubakiyya (no. 6), dated c.688/1289, shares
some of these features. All three doorways represent a
continuation of Crusader-Ayyubid architectural traditions as
exemplified by the gadroon-arched entrances to the Church of
the Holy Sepulchre, the Sigaya of al-‘Adil and the Afdaliyya
Madrasa (plates 2.5, 2.6 and 9). The Ayyubid and Mamluk
examples may incorporate re-used Crusader elements, but no
reliable criterion has yet been recognized for differentiating
between Crusader sculpture and later copies of it. At least the
 capitals of the elbow consoles at the Turba of Barka Khan,
shown ina drawing by Pierotti of 1864 (plate 2.7) but no longer
in situ, must be Crusader spolia.”' A.G. Walls, who recorded the
building 1968-71, observed what he considered to be one of
the original capitals among a miscellaneous collection of
worked stones in a corner of the courtyard.” The arrangement
of the various components, such as the hoodmould that turns
outwards above the springing level of the arches, appears,
however, to be Mamlik. i
This entrance to the reading room was still open in 1900
but had been partly blocked up and converted into a window
by 1920 (see plate 2.1) and we may surmise that this and other
changes took place shortly after the library was opened in 1900.
 (iv) Fourth phase

This involved the partial filling of the two archways
immediately to the east of the reading room to form a window
in the western one and a portal and small water trough in the
eastern one. A two-line inscription above the window records
the event:

This window and the dome over the tomb (ézerba) of the
deceased prince Husam al-Din Barka Khan and the vault
(qantara) and its upper floor (ahvahda/‘ulwaha) and the
blessed portal (bawwdba) and the drinking trough
(masqda) and the shops (hawdnit) and their upper floor
and the five apartments (buyzit) in the waqf house (bi-dar
al-wagf) were constructed (ansha’a) by ... Muhammad b.
Ahmad b. Timur (?) al“Ala’. . . at the beginning of Dha’ |-
Qa‘da 792 (11 October 1390).

The windows, portal and drinking trough are all that is
positively recognizable of the things itemized in the
inscription. Of the (rebuilt) dome over the turba nothing
survives, and of the vault and its upper floor nothing is
identifiable except possibly four corbels above the portal. The
shops and the five apartments are no longer identifiable.

The grilled window” bearing the inscription on its lintel is
built of red and cream-coloured ablaq masonry framed by a
quirked ogee moulding (fig. 2.4). On either side of the
inscription two marble plaques are carved with wane
blazon-like devices which, according to M. Meinecke,” are
probably to be construed as s the tribal badge or renk of Barka

Oe Resin pe ag ISS a Rear, ae Ne BAER Bree eH GE TL pS
 representing a string course of joggled voussoirs, the central
one of which is more elaborately modelled than the others and
is inscribed with the word ‘Allah’. Above the frame moulding, in
the tympanum of the earlier arch, there is a seven-line
inscription, the historical part of which reads:

_.. This is the tomb (trba) of .. . Barkat Khan, may God
illuminate his grave (darih). He died on Friday 1
Muharram 644 (18 May 1246)...

This inscription must belong to the original monument, having
been removed to its present position presumably during the
work done in 792/1390. It is recessed 0.04m into the
surrounding masonry, which has been given a bevelled edge to
frame the panel. The bevelling at the base of the panel, cut in
the top of the same stones as the quirked ogee moulding
framing the grilled window, continues a little way on either
side of the panel, as if the frame was intended for a wider
inscription. In fact this bevelling is exactly the same width as the
inscribed window lintel (1.25m), which suggests some sort of
relationship between the two, though what that relationship
might have been or been intended to be is not clear. Above the
seven-line inscription is a circular oculus (now blocked) with a
bevelled rim surrounded by an elegant border of finely carved
olive or palm leaves.

The portal built into the earlier archway to the east of the
grilled window consists of a shallow recess, 0.35m deep,
spanned by a pointed horseshoe arch. A cavetto hoodmould
around the extrados of the arch extends laterally on both sides
at the springing as far as the jambs of the earlier, enclosing
archway. Little carved leaves similar to those in the border
round the oculus decorate the corners of the hoodmould at the
springing and at downturns at either extremity (see fig. 2.4).
The voussoirs of the arch have been replaced at some time with
crudely worked stones now smeared with cement. The two
springers survive, however, to show that originally the arch was
composed of gadroon voussoirs evidently in imitation of those
of the Romanesque doorway. The door at the back of the recess
has jambs of red and cream-coloured ablag and is flanked by
the customary stone benches. Above the portal a rectangular
window (now blocked) opened under the keystones of the
enclosing archway.

The portal is placed left of centre in that archway to allow
space for a niche alongside, which houses the drinking trough
mentioned in the inscription of 792/1390. Though badly
damaged, the pointed arch over the niche can be seen originally
to have been gadrooned like that of the portal (see fig. 2.4). The
stone trough in the lower part of the niche appears to have
been filled by pouring water directly into it from the street; it
 has only a small drain hole (diameter 0.04m) at the bottom.
There is no trace of any water supply within the building
complex.

The four roll corbels, whose introduction entailed
removal of a section of the cornice, are centred on the archway
enclosing the portal and drinking trough. They were evidently
intended to support a balcony or an oriel window like the one
immediately to the east of the portal, shown in plate 2.1, which
was demolished as recently as 1984. Anearly contemporaneous
oriel window survives at the Tashtamuriyya (no. 45) built in
784/1382-83. These corbels are all that remain of what may have
been the upper floor mentioned in the inscription of 792/1390.
No trace of a staircase exists.

INTERIOR (plan, fig. 2.3)
The entrance portal described above is now the entrance to the
library. It leads into an open courtyard on two levels, one 0.23m
highér than the other. This courtyard occupies the space
formerly occupied by two of the three shops behind the earlier
archways. It is enclosed by relatively modern walls on three
sides and by the street wall on the fourth, north side.

The east wall contains traces of a partition wall of the
earlier shops at its north end; the remainder of the wall is later.
About the centre is a door leading into the cross-vaulted room
 Plate 2.8 East side of courtyard

‘A’, with a window on the right. Both door and window have
distinctive projecting surrounds (see plate 2.8), typically
nineteenth-century Ottoman in style, which appear to have
been added to earlier openings. The upper part of this east wall
is of more regular masonry in which four identical windows
open, each with a projecting surround similar to those of the
door and window below (plate 2.8) and all obviously late
Ottoman.

The south wall is quite plain apart from remains of
medieval masonry at the west end (plate 2.9), which must
belong to the earlier shops on the site.

The west wall contains a door and a window opening into
the reading room. Both openings have projecting frames like
those in the east wall but here with flat instead of segmental
arches (plate 2.3).

The present owners reported that the east and west walls
of the reading room were rebuilt about 1876 for a family
mosque.” The exterior masonry of the west wall (which forms
the frontage on ‘Aqabat Abt Madyan) is similar to that of the east
wall. That part of the south wall of the reading room that
confronts ‘Aqabat Aba Madyan belongs to the same period of
construction as the west wall (plate 2.1). Inside the reading
room a trefoil-arched mibrab in the middle of the south wall
(see fig. 2.6) is a relic of this room’s adaptation as a mosque.

Built into the outer face of the east wall of the reading
room are three inscriptions, epitaphs of Barka Khan and his
sons.”’ These inscriptions must have been built into the wall at
the time of its construction, about 1876, or later. Two of them
were seen by Sandreczki in 1865 on the south and north sides,
respectively, of the courtyard (above, p. 110). Under each
inscription there is a low stone platform (0.30m high) revetted
with plain nineteenth-century ceramic tiles. The middle
platform (2.30m long x 1.00m wide) abuts on the reading room
wall. The other two are freestanding. The southern is 1.50m x
0.90m and the northern 1.70m x 0.90m. They appear to be
cenotaphs, each related to an epitaph in the wall. Presumably
they were built at the same time as the epitaphs were built into
the wall. An outline of vaults in the upper part of the wall seems
to indicate that the courtyard was vaulted — or re-vaulted —
when the wall was rebuilt around 1876. The vaulting did not last
long, however, for a photograph of about 1920 in the collection
of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem shows the
courtyard open to the sky.

INTERPRETATION

Of the phases of construction described above, it is the third
and fourth — belonging to the Mamluk period — that concern us
here. The first of these, phase (iii), was built probably some
time after 663/1265 when a village that was endowed upon the
turba was granted to the founder,” Badr al-Din Muhammad
Bey, son of Barka Khan, and before Badr al-Din’s burial in 679/
1280. By analogy with the nearly contemporary Kubakiyya
 Turba we may reasonably assume that the Romanesque
doorway was the entrance to the original Turba, square in plan,
covered by a dome.

All three epitaphs state bluntly that ‘this is the grave (gabr)
of...’ and it may be presumed that each originally marked a
cenotaph of some kind in the tomb chamber, subsequently
removed from there before 1865 when Sandreczki saw two of
them in the courtyard. The inscription in the street facade
above the grilled window of the fourth phase, which includes
the words ‘this is the tomb (zrba) of . . . Barkat Khan’, was,
together with the two plaques bearing his revk, doubtless set in
a prominent position; a possible place would have been over a
window in the west facade which no longer survives.

The eastward extension, phase (iv), was made in 792/1390
to create a new street facade roughly symmetrical about the
central grilled window. Nothing is known about the amir
responsible for this work apart from his name: Muhammad b.
Ahmad b. Timur (?) al-‘Ala’I. What his intention might have
been in restoring the dome of the turba and adding a new
facade is obscure; the area behind that new facade, the present
courtyard, may on the basis of Haram document no. 36 (cited
above) have been intended as a mosque, though in that case we
should have expected some mention of it in the inscriptions.
 LAPIDARY SHIELDS

Of the six shields carved on two piers of the early archways
incorporated into the complex in 792/1390, four have been
partly defaced and none is cut with any great precision. But the
design is clear: a T within a circle. Several analogous shields in
the form of an upside-down T enclosed by an isosceles triangle
resting on its point (fig. 2.10) are to be found elsewhere in
Jerusalem: five, all much the same size and at roughly shoulder
height in the outer porch of Bab al-Silsila/Bab al-Sakina; two
others similar in size and height above ground at the entrance
to the Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-Din (below, p. 126); another similar in
size and also at shoulder height on the street frontage of the Dar
al-Qur’an al-Sallamiyya (below, p. 382): and one similar in shape
but very much larger on the southern abutment of an arch
spanning the street immediately to the west of the Stq al-
Lahhamin,” one of the three parallel markets in the centre of
 the town. The date of none of the structures on which these
shields are carved is known with precision. The tomb chamber
of the Ribat is probably Ayyubid (below, p. 121), as is the porch
at Bab al-Silsila, which is datable between 583/1187 and 595/
1199-1200.*° The structure of the nearby Dar al-Qur’an and the
arch by the Siq al-Lahhamin may be Crusader and the arcade of
the Turba of Barka Khan is probably so (above, p. 111). All
appear to have been built before the Mamluk period at least.
The shields are clearly not masons’ marks: they are too big
and are found at shoulder height where they look as if they have

is found on a jeton excavated with associated Crusader and
Ayyubid coins by C. N. Johns ina thirteenth century destruction
layer at ‘Atlit (Pilgrims’ Castle)?! (fig. 2.11).

If all these examples are nearly contemporaneous they
could only have been made after the recovery of Jerusalem by
Saladin in 583/1187 and before 658/1260 when Jerusalem was
definitely incorporated into the Mamluk empire. Given that
‘Atlit was in Templar hands for much of that time and that all the
shields bear some form of the letter ‘T’ it is tempting to
speculate that the shields similar to the ‘Atlit eto identified
buildings that were Templar possessions during the period
626-642/1229-1244 when Jerusalem was ceded to the Franks by
al-Malik al-Kamil. Future research in the Crusader cartularies
might shed more light on the subject.

3,"Ii HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

In the street running up to the Gate of the Inspector (Bab al-
Nazir) stands the Hospice (7ibdt) of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir
‘opposite the Hospice of al-Manstr’.' A marble tablet within the
porch contains the following inscription?

In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. This
is the wagqf of the Amir ‘Ala’ al-Din Aydughdi al-Rukni. He
has made a perpetual waqf of all that is within this door,
the vaulted rooms and the courtyard, in favour of the poor
who come on pilgrimage to Jerusalem the Noble, in the
year six hundred and sixty-six.

DATE

The date, 666/1267-8, is confirmed by Mujir al-Din, but
presumably on the strength of the inscription since he says:
‘. . No waqf document of his survived, so his charitable
donation was authenticated before the Qadi and the document
(mahdar) confirming its legal status was drawn up and dated
Thursday, 18 Rabi‘ II, 742 [Thursday, 4 October 1341].”

FOUNDER

‘Ala’ al-Din Aydughdi was a mamluk of the Ayyubid sultan, al-
Salih Najm al-Din Ayyab.* He moved to the service of Baybars
—hence in all probability the appellation al-Rukni — and in late
660/1262 was sent on a secret mission to arrest Taybars al-
Waziri, the governor of Damascus. He became blind and went
to reside in Jerusalem, where he served as Superintendent of
the Two Harams (Jerusalem and Hebron) both for Baybars and
al-Mansiir Qalawtn. He had a reputation for good government
—‘in his days the waqfs flourished and their yield multiplied? —
 and for piety and sagacity. His own foundations were
numerous. In addition to the hospice, he built an ablutions
place (mathara) for the mosque at Medina, paved the platform
(sabn) around the Dome of the Rock, and erected a building
near the mosque at Hebron, which included ovens and mills
with storerooms for wheat and barley above. He also increased
the daily charitable distribution in Hebron.® In addition Mujir
al-Din appears to say that ‘Ala’ al-Din repaired both the
ablutions area of the Haram in Jerusalem and the gate leading
to it.” In 665/1266-7 he carried out works on the water supply to
the Haram and its immediate western surroundings.

He overcame his loss of sight and was a respected and
active administrator. It is said that he was able to trace the
foundations for a bath-house at Hebron and mark them with
lime for the builders, although only Ibn Taghribirdi, the
fifteenth-century historian, spells out that he was blind at the
time. He took great delight too in the breeding of blood-stock
and always recognised his own horses.” The happy epithet al-
Basir (insightful) was applied to him. In time, by a not
uncommon process, his tomb — he died in Shawwal 693/
August-September 1294 and was buried within his hospice —
was converted into a holy place.’ By 994/1537,"""" and regularly
thereafter , he is referred to in the Jerusalem Sijills as wali Allah
(saint) and as shaykh.

ENDOWMENT

The Ottoman land register, Defter no. 522, contains a relatively
long summary of the waqf of ‘Ala’ al-Din. The date of the
wagfiyya is there said to be 741/1340-1, which is one year
earlier than the date of the mahbdar mentioned by Mujir al-Din
(see above). A translation of the sijill entry follows:'*

The waqf of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir. After the upkeep of the
hospice, the two cisterns in it and its special ablutions
place (mathara), and of the rest of the property of the
wagqf, the administrator should pay to the caretaker’ of the
hospice aforementioned eight dirhams monthly. His duty
is to sweep, lock up and open, and clean the hospice,
to... ! the ablutions place, to light the lamps, that is two
lamps every night until morning, one in the assembly hall
(majma’) of the hospice and the other in the ablutions
place. [He should issue him] a half rotl of bread according
to the Jerusalem measure each day. The administrator
should pay what he thinks fit to purchase rope, buckets,
lamps (ganddil), ewers and mats to furnish” the assembly
hall which is in the aforementioned hospice. What
 remains after that he should expend to buy medium-
quality bread and distribute it to the poor and indigent
who come to this hospice, to each one daily two rotls of the
aforementioned bread according to the Egyptian measure
—for five days, beyond which period the distribution [to an
individual] should not continue. If it proves difficult to
distribute to each person for five days, then let it be done
for three days. If the visitors are numerous and the waqf
cannot manage to satisfy all, the firstcomers shall be given
precedence over those poor who come after them. The
administration of the hospice and its endowments shall be
in the hands of the Imam for the time being at the Dome
of the Rock. The date of the wagfiyya is the year 741
[1340-1].

It is interesting to note thata sijill entry, dated 1008/1599, makes
it clear that the Amir ‘Ala’ al-Din had stipulated in his wagfiyya
that the land should remain undeveloped (Rashf), to act as a
run-off area for water which would be collected and conveyed
by a conduit (gandt) to the cistern (birka) alongside the bath.
By the late sixteenth century the cistern was ruined, the conduit
choked and the bath unused ‘for a long time’. The qadi allowed
the mutawalli of the waqf to effect a six-year lease of the land
(to be ploughed and planted with various fruit trees and vines)
for 420 paras.”!
 SUBSEQUENT HISTORY
The waqf properties of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir appear five times to
our knowledge in the Haram documents. The hospice itself is
alluded to only once, in connection with the death ofa resident,
the Shaykh ‘Umar al-Sharafi, in 796/1394.” Otherwise the wagf
properties of the hospice are three times mentioned as the
residence or lodging of persons.” In another case the west
boundary of a house near the Patriarch’s Pool is given as the
square (al-rahba), the waqf of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir.** Finally —
and it is the earliest mention — in 747/1346 three contiguous
shops ‘built by the father of the vendor’ were sold for 780
dirhams. They are described as ‘standing on land given as
endowment to the hospice of the Amir ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Rukni...
These shops are... near the covered market (qaysariyya) of the
late Amir Sayf al-Din Tankiz . . .”? Perhaps these shops were
developments of the items (vi) and (vii) in the list above. Since
there are no plots of land in the list of endowments, on which
the vendor’s father could have built his shops, it does appear
that the earliest buildings, perhaps already ruinous, had been
sold by the waqf, which retained only an interest in the land, to
the extent of one silver dirham as a monthly ground-rent.

The Defter no. 522 records a later waqf in favour of the
hospice as follows:”°

An account for the month of Rajab 945/November-
December 1538 reveals that there were 17 residents (not
including the bawwdb). They are called ‘the gentlemen (al/-
sada) poor in retreat (al-mujawirin) in the cells of the hospice
of Shaykh ‘Ala al-Din’. They received six paras each and the
bawwab eight. There was another group of eleven persons,
called ‘the poor in the assembly hall’, who received only one
para each. If we add these sums to the 20 for the administrator,
the same for the clerk, 150 for repairs to the bath of ‘Ala’ al-Din
and other waqf property, 12 for oil for lighting (for Rajab and
Sha‘ban) and 10 for court expenses, etc., the grand total is 330
paras. In just the next month 502% Aleppo silver had to be
found for repairs to the bath-house because of an accident with
the boiler.**

As a result of earthquake damage, the collapse of the vault
over the tomb of the founder (and with it a small room which
belonged to the Manjakiyya), in 952/1546 it was decided that
there was no use in restoring what had fallen and the qadi
allowed the administrator of the Manjakiyya to auction the
rubble and sell it for 500 aspers.*° Earlier in the same year, the
register records that a session of the qadi’s court was held in
‘the mosque (/a@mi‘) of the hospice’, but without specifying
why.*°

During the early seventeenth century the right to live in
the hospice was granted by the qadi, in rooms in either the
western or northern rank (saff), according to the few examples
I have seen. In one case a man who had been awarded the
privilege in 1047/1637 resigned it to another in 1066/1656.”
The new man was specifically free to reside there himself or to
let the room! We have come a long way from the terms of the
original endowment with its restriction to five, or even three,
days’ supply of bread. May one infer that the length of residence
was also similarly limited in the early years? Who later were the
‘poor’ residents who qualified to be addressed as ‘gentlemen’?

 ATER AlST ORY
Arif al-‘Arif outlines the later history of the building:

At the beginning of the Turkish [Ottoman] period this ribat
and the Manstri Ribat were taken as dwellings for the
Tukarina. They are of African origin, coming from Darfur
[western Sudan] and its environs. The Turkish
Government employed them in police matters and by
agreement gave them the guardianship of the madrasas
which were situated in the dwellings (dr), residences
(mandazil) and porticoes (arwiga) around the west and
north sides of the Haram. The performance of these duties
gave them the right to live there. They were always loyal to
the State. They are black, tall, strongly built. They were
 given, by agreement, the guardianship of the gates of the
Haram, for it was forbidden for Christians and foreigners
to enter the Haram, and there was trouble for anyone who
tried to go against this order and to approach any one of
the gates, even princes and kings of foreign nations:
entrance to the Haram was forbidden to them except by
permission of the Tukarina, and they were unlikely to
allow this to any non-Muslim. We see this rule most vividly
in the middle of the nineteenth century [1855] when the
Mutasarrif of Jerusalem was obliged to imprison the
Tukarina so as to enable a king to visit the Haram.** These
two ribats were made into a prison at the end of the
Turkish period. In one of them, the southern one [i.e. the
Manstri Ribat], were kept those in custody awaiting
judgment, and in the other those who had been sentenced.
This was called the ‘Prison of Blood’ (sijn al-dam). And so
things remained until the British occupation when the
English moved the prison to the place now known as al-
Muskawbiyya.” Nowadays they are inhabited only by the
poor Tukarina who live by begging.”

When van Berchem last visited Jerusalem, in 1914, these two
ribats were still in use as prisons. Now their courtyards are full
of modern huts providing accommodation for the bulk of
Jerusalem’s African community; delightful _ people
characterized by a disarming blend of African joie de vivre and
Arab hospitality.
 "
3,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","STREET FRONTAGE (fig. 3.4)
The Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-Din would have needed little alteration to
adapt it for use as a prison. There are few openings in the
external (south) wall and the other boundaries are entirely
enclosed by adjoining buildings. The only entrance to the
courtyard is placed more or less centrally in the street frontage.
That frontage shows four different styles of masonry. On
the right (east), the high wall of the tomb chamber is
particularly distinctive: it is built of roughly coursed stones,
most of which have a smooth margin drafted round an irregular
boss (plate 3.1, in which the patches of whitish stone around
the door and lower window belong to repairs made in 1971).
The masonry of the entrance portal is dressed smooth except
for a recurrence of the bossed masonry of the tomb chamber in
places immediately above the arched opening (plate 3.2). West
of the entrance portal the wall is set back 0.82m. In this western
section of the frontage two types of masonry have been used:
 Te ee senate

Plate 3. 3 Exterior of window in north wall of tomb chamber

large, coursed ashlars in the lower part of the wall contrasting
with the smaller finely dressed coursed ashlars of the upper
part, which extends over the ribat’s entrance to abut against the
tomb chamber (fig. 3.4). These various masonry types indicate
several stages in a complex sequence of construction.

The first clue to the interpretation of that sequence occurs
in Mujir al-Din’s description of a later building, the Hasaniyya
Madrasa, which he says is ‘at Bab al-Nazir, over the Ribat of ‘Ala’
al-Din al-Basir . . . It was built in 837 (1434)."" Clearly the
Hasaniyya Madrasa is the building at first floor level extending
westwards from above the entrance of the ribat, as its
symmetrical fenestration and cavetto cornice indicate (fig. 3.4).
The entrance to this madrasa is situated beyond the western
limits of the ribat (below, p. 536).

In the lower part of the tomb chamber there is one large
window through which the cenotaph over the tomb of the
founder may be seen, and, at the eastern extremity, a door
leading into the tomb chamber. In addition to the window at
street level three smaller clerestorey lights, with narrow slit
windows over the eastern and central ones (fig. 3.4), light the
interior. The distinctive bossed masonry extends to the full
height of the wall. Similar masonry occurs elsewhere in and
around Jerusalem. It is common enough in the Crusader and
Ayyubid periods, particularly in fortifications, but is
unrecorded in original Mamluk construction. This suggests that
the structure of the tomb chamber predates the construction of
the ribat. It is probably Ayyubid, for an arched window in its
north wall (plate 3.3) is built from stones of different shapes
and sizes bearing distinctive traces of Crusader workmanship
(diagonal tooling and masons’ marks), which are obviously in
 re-use. The disposition of the smooth and bossed masonry
shows what had happened. The tomb chamber predates the
portal. In 666/1267-68 the portal was built against the tomb
chamber (which did not house ‘Ala’ al-Din’s tomb until 693/
1294, of course) by first dismantling part of the corner wall in
order to key in the impost of the arch. The stones thus removed
were set aside, the portal constructed to the height of the
keystone of the arch, and then the removed stones were re-
used to complete the construction of the upper part of the
portal.

The entrance portal consists of a deep, vaulted porch
flanked by stone benches (mastabas) before a small door
(1.76m high by 0.91m wide) (plate 3.2). Above the door the
lintel is decorated with a curious arrangement of bevelled
chevron motifs framed by a raised band carved with a regular
pattern of continuous triangles. The fact that this raised band
does not continue along the upper rim of the panel shows that
the stone has been re-used as a lintel. The style of its decoration
is Ottoman and it appears to be a later insertion replacing the
original lintel. A relieving lintel composed of two stones of
equal sizes is carved with counterfeit voussoirs to suggest a flat
arch. Immediately above is the foundation inscription (above,
p.117) set back about 3cm from the face of the wall ina chamfer
frame (plate 3.4, fig. 3.4).

Details of the construction of the vault of the porch show
that its original form has been altered. From the plan (the plan
of the vault is shown as a broken line in fig. 3.3) it will be
observed that there are springers not only for the arch of the
present entrance but for another arch at right angles to it on the
west side of the porch. The original porch appears therefore to
have been open on two sides. Thus the mastaba on the west
side of the porch is a later insertion and the pier at the south-
west corner, barely engaged into the adjoining masonry now,
must have been freestanding then. The chamfering (to reduce
abrasion) of the three visible corners of the pier suggests as
much — otherwise there could be no reason for chamfering the
north-east corner. Were it possible to remove a small piece of
the masonry engaging the north-west corner of the pier we
should surely find that that corner is also chamfered.

Thus the lower part of the western wall of the street
frontage was constructed after the entrance to the ribat but
some time before the construction of the Hasaniyya Madrasa
which it supports. Unfortunately, a small doorway in this wall is
blocked (fig. 3.4) and so it is not possible now to view the
 western aspect of the unusually arranged entrance to the ribat.

INTERIOR (plan, fig. 3.3)

On passing through the entrance door one enters a small
intervenient yard which is open to the sky. The cross-vaulted
chamber on the east side of this yard is of manifestly recent
construction, as is the high wall on its north side, which may
reasonably be ascribed to adaptations made for the nineteenth-
century prison. On the other hand the wall on the west side,
which skews north-east away from the entrance before
continuing northwards, is not. The upper part of the wall,
supported by a half-arch (fig. 3.6), continues over the skew,
which is simply cut out of the lower part of the wall. In other
words, part of the thick east wall of the vaulted halls was cut
away to allow the entrance of the ribat to be placed as far as
possible towards the centre of the north wall of the entrance
porch. For this to have been necessary the halls must have been
standing before the porch was built (see below).

Asmall door in the modern north wall of the intervenient
yard opens north into the main courtyard. A wide, well-made
pointed-arched doorway immediately on the left leads into the
first of the two vaulted halls, marked ‘A’ on the plan. The
vaulting consists of two parallel north-south tunnel vaults
interconnected by two transverse vaults forming groins at the
intersections and resting on a central pier (plate 3.5) and
salient responds in the north and south walls. A recess in the
south wall may have originally contained a window that was
blocked up when the later wall supporting the Hasaniyya
Madrasa was added (above, p. 536). Apart from that there were
no other windows; the present two high-level windows in the
north wall are modern. This hall must be the ‘assembly hall’
mentioned in the endowment deed recorded in the Tahrir
register no. 522 (see above, p. 117). In 1971 the hall was
consecrated as a mosque for the African community.” The
event is commemorated by an inscription in the entrance
porch alongside the foundation inscription (plate 3.4). The
mibrab of the mosque, a queer skeletal frame of stone (plate
3.5), dates from this time; there is no evidence of any earlier
mibrab within the confines of the ribat.

In the south-west corner of the courtyard a pointed-arched
doorway similar to that of the first vaulted hall opens into
another hall, marked ‘B’, which is roofed with a barrel vault and
now filled almost to the crown of the vault with debris. This
second hall is structurally homogeneous with the first and must
 be contemporaneous with it. The masonry of their continuous
north wall is very rough with no special features (plate 3.13). It
has been shown above to be pre-Mamlik, and to judge by its
poor quality (apart from the door arches) it is probably Ayyubid
rather than earlier. An excision in the western half of the vault
 (see plan, fig. 3.3) suggests that there may once have been an
opening under it in the west wall but this is entirely concealed
by debris. This hall must have been the ablutions place
mentioned in the Tahrir register no. 522 (see above, p. 117).

No cisterns are now visible within the confines of the ribat,
though two are mentioned in the Tahrir register no. 522. One
of them is indicated in the 1865 Ordnance Survey plan as being
in the vicinity of the south-west corner of the courtyard.

In the south-east corner of the courtyard two small rooms,
marked ‘C’ and ‘D’ on the plan, occupy a salient filling the
corner. This salient is part of the same Ayyubid structure as the
tomb chamber; it rises to the same height and shares the same
bossed masonry (plate 3.6). Above rooms ‘C’ and ‘D’ there is a
larger room marked ‘E’ on the upper floor plan, fig. 35.4, which
is reached by way of a staircase incorporated into the
Manjakiyya Madrasa (see below, no. 35).

The courtyard itself is crowded with such a jumble of
modern shanties that little can be seen of the lower west, north
and east walls. The layout of the cells round the courtyard is
shown on the ground floor plan. Each cell had a pointed-
 arched doorway (plate 3.7) and it is clear that they all form part
of ‘Ala’ al-Din’s construction. The arrangement of the cells at
the north wall is very regular; each has a barrel vault spanning
from east to west. (Many of the partition walls between these
cells have been removed to create larger rooms more
convenient for domestic use.) In the east and west ranges of
cells variations occur in the vaulting (see plan, fig. 3.3). On the
west side two cells have cross-vaults, two have barrel vaults
 spanning north — south, and one has a barrel vault spanning
east — west. On the east side the barrel vaults span east — west
and one cell has a curious extension that apparently goes
beyond the eastern limits of the site. These variations are
difficult to explain unless they were suggested to or imposed
upon the builders of the ribat by the existence of some
unidentified earlier structures around the site.

The buildings on the upper storeys at the north and east
 walls, and the heightening of the west wall (which has no
buildings at first floor level) are Ottoman. The east wall (plate
3.8) in particular displays characteristic features of Ottoman
architecture in Jerusalem: round relieving arches in the
masonry above openings, paired windows and small star-
shaped oculi over the mullions.

TOMB CHAMBER

The street door is now the only entrance to the tomb chamber.
It is likely that there was originally an entrance from the
courtyard: the recess in the north wall of the chamber appears
to be a door which was blocked, possibly at the time of ‘Ala’ al-
Din’s burial in 693/1294, in order to isolate the tomb chamber
from the ribat.

Inside, the tomb chamber appears disproportionately
high since an intermediate floor that once divided it no longer
survives. Vestiges of that former floor remain in the extra
thickness of the lower north, east and west walls (plates 3.9 and
3.10) and in the outline of a vault at the west end of the chamber
(plate 3.10). The floor collapsed in the earthquake of Dhw'l-
Qa‘da 952/January 1546, according to a docket in the Shari'a
Court archives (see above, p. 119), and was not rebuilt. A
blocked doorway in the upper part of the north wall (marked
‘d on the upper floor plan, fig. 35.4) originally gave access to
that floor from the adjoining room ‘E’ (see above). At the same
level there are several other openings: two windows west of the
blocked door on the north side, of which one is blocked and
the other set in a curious arched recess like a doorway (plate
3.3) with a projecting sill decorated with re-used Crusader
mouldings; three windows in the south side of the tomb
chamber overlooking the street, two of which are surmounted
by slits (see above, p. 121); a high level slit window (now
blocked) in the east wall; and an opening to the west (plate
 3.10) over the entrance portal, blocked by the Hasaniyya
Madrasa which abuts against it.

The vaulting of the chamber is unusual. Three cross vaults
separated by transverse arches spring from tall abutments
against the north and south walls. Those against the north wall
bear on a ledge formed by the broadening of the lower wall
originally intended to help support the intermediate floor. The
abutments against the south wall extend to floor level. Though
the masonry of these abutments is not continuous with that of
the walls, the manner in which they are engaged by the lower

A large stone cenotaph over the grave in the centre of the
chamber is covered with a green pall draped over a gabled
timber frame (plate 3.9). The pall was renewed after 1977.
Before then an earlier one bore an embroidered panel, visible
from the street, inscribed in Arabic:

In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. O
Judge of the Protectors (qadi al-hamiyat), this is the grave
of the saint (wali Allah), the Shaykh ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basiri.

The grave had acquired an odour of sanctity by the end of the
ninth/fifteenth century when Mujir al-Din remarked that
‘prayers near his grave are answered’. By 944/1537 ‘Ala’ al-Din
had become referred to as ‘wali Allah’ or ‘al-shaykh’ (see above,
p. 119). Van Berchem observed tersely that ‘if this Turkish amir
was transformed into a saint . .. itis perhaps less because of his
merits than the fact that his tomb is situated at an entrance to the
Haram, that is to say on holy ground.”*

","The Mu‘azzamiyya, a madrasa for the Hanafi rite, was endowed
in 606/1209 and completed in 614/1217-18.! In its construction
considerable quantities of ancient masonry was re-used,
including a famous inscription from the precinct of Herod’s
Temple.’ Much of the lower part of the street frontage on the
north side of Tariq al-Mujahidin is built of large rusticated
stones that appear to be ancient and may be in secondary use.
Above this rusticated masonry, at a point where the street
frontage returns about 1.15m to the north, stands the squat
stone tower of the minaret.

The meaning of the word ‘#mdGra is ambiguous: it can mean
either ‘construction’ or ‘restoration.’ However, the structural
conjunction between the minaret and the wall of the madrasa
(see below) seems to indicate that the present minaret does not
replace an earlier one.

Al-Malik al-Qahir, the builder of the minaret, was a son of
the founder of the madrasa, al-Malik al-Mu‘azzam ‘Isa, Ayyubid
governor of the province of Damascus. Doubtless a condition
of the madrasa’s endowment was that for the post of
administrator the founder’s descendants should have priority.
 "
4,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","A simple stone tower, square in plan, the minaret is of the
traditional Syrian type, said to be derived from early church
towers.‘ Its interior is no longer accessible but a slit window in
the south face of the shaft must have lit an internal staircase.
That staircase will presumably have been covered by some
superstructure or lantern which would shelter it from the rain
and snow; no trace of such survives and none is visible in an
early photograph of the minaret taken in 1865. That
photograph (plate 4.2) shows that the upper part of the shaft
 was decorated with a corbelled cornice. Some stones in the
single course of stones above the cornice had intriguing,
apparently sculptured, projections. None of this upper part of
the minaret survives, however, and an earlier wall that abutted
on the east side of the shaft has been replaced by modern
shops. Early photographs such as plate 4.2 reveal that that
earlier wall was crowned by a cyma cornice and that the shaft of
the minaret was built around it, suggesting that if that earlier
wall belonged to the madrasa (as van Berchem’s sketch plan,
fig. 4.2, shows to be likely) then the minaret is a later addition.

a central row of four pillars; the vaulting of its western
extension is supported on three smaller pillars. One of the cells

 "
5,"Ill HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

The building is fully indentified by an excellently preserved
foundation inscription which is situated to the rear of the large
porch above the lintel of the door. Mujir al-Din places the
hospice, which he describes as ‘extremely beautiful and
soundly built’, in the street of the Bab al-Nazir, a gate which the
earlier source, al-‘Umari, called the Gate of the Hospice of al-
Mansi (Bab al-Ribat al-Mansiiri),’ no doubt, because of its
proximity to that important institution on the south side of the
street leading to the gate into the Haram. A house built by al-
Shuja‘i Shahin on the south side of the Bab al-Nazir street had
the hospice as its eastern boundary and filled the space up to
‘the street leading to the Cotton-Merchants’ Gate [i.e. the Wad
St.2] and the house of Mugbil al-Tawashi over the street’. The
southern boundary of the house was a separate Old Ladies’
Hospice (perhaps the one referred to on p. 145).

DATE

According to the inscription, the order for construction and the
endowment of the institution are linked and dated to the year
681/1282-3; doubtless, in the conventional way, the year given
is the year of completion. The text of the inscription is as
follows:4

In the name of God the Compassionate, the Merciful.
Praise be to God whose bounty has encompassed
everything, and God bless our Lord, Muhammad, and his
family. There ordered the construction of this blessed
hospice and gave it in trust to benefit the poor and
pilgrims to Jerusalem our Lord the Sultan al-Malik al-
Manstr Abu’l-Ma‘ali Sayf al-Dunya wa’l-Din Qalawtn al-
 Salihi (may God perpetuate his reign and accept [this
work] from him) in the year 681.

The Defters, nos. 522 and 602, also note that the date of the
wagfiyya was 681/1282-3.

FOUNDER

This is not the place to give a long detailed account of the life
of Sultan Qalawtn. An imported mamluk of Qipjaq Turkish
origin, he was a colleague of Baybars in the Bahriyya regiment
and his eventual successor in the sultanate. His full
independent rule began in Rajab 678/November 1279 and
lasted till his death on Saturday 6 Dha’l-Qa‘da 689/Saturday 11
November 1290, aged about seventy years.

His grandest and most famous buildings are in Cairo, the
complex of madrasa, mausoleum and hospital on the main
north-south thoroughfare of the old city. In Hebron, in the year
679/1280-1, he erected a hospice (no longer extant) ‘for Sifis
(fugara’), pilgrims to [the tomb of] Abraham’,’ and also built a
hospital there, besides other unspecified works.*

In the Christian Quarter of Jerusalem, an inscription on
the south side of the street, east of the entrance to St. Saviours,
records the repair of a mosque (masjid) and its endowment
with neighbouring properties by an unnamed benefactor in
686/1287 during the reign of Qalawiin.? This inscription may or
may not be im situ but doubtless belonged to the mosque
attributed to Qalawin, the existence of which in the Christian
Quarter is confirmed by a reference, dated 1071/1661, in the
Court register.'°

ENDOWMENT

No details connected with the charitable purposes or the
proposed administration of the hospice, as set out in the
endowment instrument, have been preserved for us. All we
have is the wording in the inscription (see translation above)
which refers to ‘the poor [Sifis] and pilgrims to Jerusalem’.
However, in two of the Defters and in an entry in a Jerusalem
sijill, the latter dated 941/1535, lists of the properties that
formed the endowment are given.'! The lists are not precisely
uniform but, in sum, the income of the hospice derived from
the following:

. an olive plantation at Gaza

_ one third of the village of Tayyibat al-Ism

. about one eighth of Jalama

. one third of Dayr ‘Isfir

. one third of Maghara

eighth share and is situated near the Zawiya of al-Qarafi(?), a
plot of land near ‘the big plantation’, a house and oven (fur)
in the Zahiriyya Hill district, a mill next to these, and a share in
the rents of a house, the details of which are not clear.

The Jerusalem sijill alone adds:

20. an unspecified share in the village of Kafar Sar (Nablus
district), and

21. a third of certain taxes on cattle, on water buffalo (adad),
and the tax called al-himaya.

It is of course impossible to say that all these properties
formed part of the original endowment made by Sultan
Qalawin. Some could well be later in date. One should note
that the Shaykh Majd al-Din ‘Abd al-Malik b. Abi Bakr al-Mawsili
made a waqf in 831/1427-28 in favour of the Sallamiyya Madrasa
(see p. 299). Two-thirds of the income was enjoyed by his
descendants, yet should those beneficiaries die out, then a
quarter of that amount was to go to ‘the cost of purchasing
bread to be distributed in the Manstri Hospice to the poor and
the indigent in Jerusalem’, while the remainder would benefit
other institutions.” That income seems not to have come to the
Hospice, but it is a proof that subsequent generations could
think of the Hospice as a suitable recipient of their charity.

MAMLUK PERIOD

The inventories of two female residents are preserved amongst
the Haram documents, both from the year 795/1393. One
mujdwira was from the Maghrib, but the other, from the Hijaz,
may in fact have died in another institution, because what the
document actually says is ‘in the Hospice of the Sultan in the
Bab al-Hadid (district?)’ ! (see pp. 129, 145 and 557).

In an earlier document (Haram no. 13) Ibrahim al-Nasiri
(see p. 73) petitioned for an allowance from the Hospice of
one rotl of bread daily, which was the equivalent of four loaves.
He was granted this in the place of the previous recipient now
deceased, a Shaykh Yusuf al-Kurdi. The document contains
both the report of the waqf office (diwan al-wagf) on
availability, and the order for the transfer of the allowance,
emanating — from whom? There is no clear indication but
perhaps the author of the marstim Gli (exalted order) was the
Superintendent of the Two Harams.

OTTOMAN PERIOD

The inspector of the waqfs of the hospice in the earliest
surviving sijill is the Shaykh Badr al-Din b. Muhyi al-Din b.
Jama‘a, mentioned in an acknowledgement of a debt to the
wadf of 200 Aleppo silver pieces by an inhabitant of Tayyibat al-
Ism, which is dated 937/1530.""4

As in the Haram documents, there are references to the
death of inmates. For instance, a resident Sufi (fagir mujawir)
died in 938/1532. His cell had been sealed and remained so
until an official from the court came to make an inventory of his
possessions. Iskandar al-Rimi, for that was his name, left a
considerable sum of money in various currencies. The total is
given in Aleppo silver, that is 10,835, the equivalent of 4,334
aspers. Another resident, Shaykh Ahmad al-Jabarti, who died in
952/1545, left property valued at 57 paras.”

The mechanism whereby the farm of waqf resources was
offered in a form of auction is clear from two sets of documents
in the Court registers. On 9 Ramadan 941/14 March 1535 two
men in partnership, the Qadi ‘Abd al-‘Aziz b. Muhammad b.
Nusayba al-Khazraji and the Qadi Abt’l-Ma‘ali al-Dayri al-
Hanafi, guaranteed 17,000 aspers to the administrator of the
waqf for the current year.'° There was express provision that
the two should be paid 500 aspers if anyone else should offer a
larger guaranteed sum to the waqf. This happened the next day,
when the Bolukbashi Sinan b. ‘Abdallah (the company
commander of the Citadel in Jerusalem) proposed 18,000
aspers.!’ Then on 12 Ramadan/17 March the Shaykh Aba’l-
 Haram b. al-Qalqashandi stated the rent he was prepared to
pay, 19,000 aspers.'* Similarly in 935/1546 the then lessor, a
member of the al-Dayri family, accepted a rent of 2,100 aspers
for a five year lease of a house and stable in the Bab al-Nazir
district from Shams al-Din Muhammad b. Sarim al-Din
Ibrahim. Three days later he accepted the sum of 13 Cypriot
gold coins and 30 paras from a Sinan Khalifa b. Isma‘il for the
same property and the same period.” This same Sinan was
allowed to become deputy for the administrator Sharaf al-Din
‘Isa b, Shams al-Din Muhammad b. al-Misri in Rajab 964/May
1557.

Three other lease contracts were noted. In Ramadan 952/
November 1545 the plantation outside Gaza was leased by a
local man for three years at 1,000 aspers annually.” In one,
Mustafa Celebi, described as Superintendent of the Two
Harams, leased from the inspector of this waqf some
unproductive and unbuilt-on land in Bab al-Nazir district for
thirty years at a pepper-corn rent of 60 paras for the whole
period, and with express permission to build on the site.??
Another Haram official and perhaps a relative of the above,
Hamza Celebi b. Mahmid Celebi, clerk to the waqfs of the Two
Harams, rented practically all the agricultural properties of the
hospice waqf for three years beginning 1 Dhw’l-Qa‘da 962/17
September 1555 for an annual rent of 325 gold pieces. An
interesting addition in the contract stipulates that the waqf is
also to receive a thousandth part of each year’s produce. The
remainder is to go to the contractor (musdaqi). 2

For a series of accounts which show the application of the
wagf income, see the table on p. 132.

Allowances and the use of one of the hospice’s cells,
together with the daily allowance which went with that right,
were inherited or surrendered for a consideration to others.
The assignment through the court had no doubt become a
formality. In Dhu'l-Hijja 984/February 1577 a man succeeded
his deceased brother in the enjoyment of a daily third of a rotl
of bread (a third of a full allowance, murattab).“* An individual
surrendered to another ‘his room (Aura), his residence in the
Mansiri Hospice, along with the allowance, which is worth one
asper daily’, in Sha‘ban 986/October 1578.” The right to reside
in a room ‘in the south range (al-saff al-qgibiz), and the daily
asper were granted to a Nasim b. Hasan al-‘Ajami, to replace
Hasan b. Muhammad al-Bawardi, by his misba, another
‘easterner’. This was in Rajab 1018/October 1609.”° Another fifty
years later similar rights were still being recorded. Shaykh Zayn
al-‘Arab b. ‘Abd al-Qadir b. Abi al-Lutf, on the death of another,
took up residence in his cell (kbalwa) ‘at the east end of the
south range’ in Shawwal 1071/June 1661.7”

From a report made in Shawwal 1071/June 1661 it may be
inferred that the governor of Nablus collected as tax some
proportion of the waqf income, which was stored in the
hospice for him. Faraj Bey sent his man, Jamshid Agha, to
Jerusalem concerning the loss of wheat, barley and lentils of
his, stored in a room to the left of the hospice entrance. The
lock was found to be defective and the store clerk (Ratib al-
ghildl), a Christian, suggested that many people knew how to
gain access, but Jamshid was told ‘no suspicion could be
attached to the inhabitants of the hospice because some were
men of religious learning (abi al- tlm) and others men of piety,
religion and felicity’.”*

LATER HISTORY

In Ottoman times this ribat, like ‘Ala’ al-Din’s opposite (no. 3),
housed the Sudanese African Haram guards and, later on, a
prison. In 1914 it was still in use as a prison. Today the
courtyard is full of shanties, the homes of members of
Terusalem’s African communitv ( Dlate 5.15).
 "
5,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","STREET FRONTAGE (fig. 5.4)
The street frontage has four component parts: (1) an eastern
facade with two finely decorated windows belonging to the
 main hall, crowned by a curious corbel table cornice (fig. 5.4),
(2) the monumental entrance bay spanned by a broad pointed
arch (fig. 5.4), (3) a plain wall to the west of the entrance bay
pierced by five small undecorated windows, and (4) an upper
facade belonging to some later construction built over the
north-east corner of the ribat. These components of the ribat
frontage are not on the same alignment, with the entrance bay
projecting 0.45m from the wall to the west and 1.11m from the
wall to the east.

The manner in which the masonry of the eastern facade is
keyed into the adjoining masonry to the east of it (visible in
plate 5.1) shows that the latter precedes the former. That earlier
structure, which continues eastwards as far as the outer porch
at the Bab al-Nazir, is probably Ayyubid: incorporated into its
 street wall are several Crusader stones along with four
fragments of two Arabic inscriptions dated by van Berchem to
the founivicn or fifth/eleventh century,” all obviously in re-
use.

Atabend in the street alignment towards the middle of the
wall to the west of the entrance bay, traces of a vertical cyma
moulding (plate 5.2) may indicate that there once existed a
portal at this point (marked ‘p’ on the plan, fig. 5.3). The profile
of the moulding appears to be Crusader and this, together with
the change of alignment and increased thickness (see fig. 5.3),
suggest that the wall to the west of the vertical moulding is of
Crusader construction. Indeed, according to Mujir al-Din, two
later foundations, the Yanusiyya (date unknown) and the
Taharkasivva Madrasa (before 791/1339), apparently just to the
 esses yaebete, ~ pate

west of the Mansuri Ribat on the south side of Tariq Bab al-
Nazir, occupied a church of which this wall may be a vestige.?”
Therefore it would appear that the street frontage of the
Manstri Ribat was erected between the remains of earlier
structures, one Ayyubid and one presumably Crusader, the
former to the east and the latter to the west.

The decoration of the facade to the east of the entrance bay
(plate 5.1) incorporates certain elements that may originally
have belonged to a Crusader church. The marble impost
mouldings of the two pointed-arched window recesses are
typically Crusader, though the red and cream-coloured ablaq
masonry of the recesses is obviously Mamltk. The corbel table
must have formed a cornice over the eastern part of the street
facade before the later addition of an upper storey. It is
curiously composed of a series of twenty consoles with little
fluted and scalloped conchs spanning between them. This is
the only instance in Jerusalem of a corbel table composed of
these two features. There are, however, several Crusader
examples of analogous corbel tables resting on elaborately
profiled consoles but without the conchs, and this may indicate
that the consoles are here in secondary use. Fluted and
scalloped conchs are relatively common in Ayyubid and
Mamlak architecture and here they appear to be the work of the
Mamluk builders of the ribat

The entrance* (plate 5.3) is distinctive: the ablag frontal
arch, composed of red and cream-coloured voussoirs resting
on deeply moulded marble imposts (possibly Crusader spoils),
opens into a very large (5.23m wide and 7.66m deep) cross-
vaulted porch. This type of monumental porch was common in
Jerusalem from the Ayyubid period until the arrival of the
‘stalactite portal’ in 695/1295 (see below, p. 157). The Salahiyya
Khanqah (waqf 585/1189), the Siqaya of al-‘Adil (589/1193), and
the Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-Din (666/1267-68) each have comparable
cross-vaulted entrance bays; the Ayyubid porch at the Bab Hitta
(see above, p. 49) is likewise cross-vaulted.

UPPER FAGADE

The upper facade belongs to a later building. The original
chevron-arched entrance doorway (plate 5.4) to that later
building is at first floor level and was reached by a double
staircase with flights leading from east and west against the
street frontage of the ribat, shown on the 1865 Ordnance
Survey plan of the Haram and its environs.*! That staircase has
disappeared, rendering the doorway inaccessible; it has been
made into a window. Since Mujir al-Din lists no Mamluk
 foundation over the Mansiri Ribat, we may assume that this
building was erected after the time of his writing, 901/1496.
Although the exact date of construction is unknown, it is
tempting to ascribe this building to the middle of the tenth/
sixteenth century on the analogy of the chevron arches on three
of Sultan Sulayman’s sabils built in the fashion of portals and
dated 943/1536-37,° along with that of the entrance to the
Maktab of Bayram Jawish (947/1540-41).*°

INTERIOR (plan, fig. 5.3)

The street now runs at a level higher than that of the pavement
of the entrance porch but this is likely to be the result of
resurfacing; the original street level was surely somewhat
lower. The stone pavement of the porch is mostly original,
incorporating several re-used flagstones with characteristic
striations similar to those at the so-called Lithostron in the
Convent of the Sisters of Zion, which are said to be Hadrianic.*”
There are plain stone benches on either side of the porch,
which return for a short distance on each side of the main
entrance doorway in the rear (south) wall. Two other doorways
open off the porch, one in the east wall opening into the main
 i paseo Sn i arc ers EPR ag Sah DR eae at tis a ae aaa gee Ue 1s UO eS RBCS -) me mR eS Or Cas Sot EP a I OLA

hall and one in the west wall opening into a cell at the north-
east corner of the courtyard (plate 5.5). The benches have been
lowered to form a step up to each of the doorways, which
suggests that the doorways are not original. Segmental arches —
a typically Ottoman feature — over the western doorway and
over the window above the eastern doorway (see fig. 5.5)
further suggest that the two doorways are later insertions.

The main entrance doorway has a monolithic lintel
surmounted by an ablag relieving arch and the foundation
inscription (see fig. 5.4). The doorway leads into the entrance
vestibule; to the left (east) is the main hall and to the right
(west) the courtyard. In front (south) two archways open on the
western extension of the main hall. The floor of the main hall
and its extension is almost 0.50m higher than that of the
vestibule.

The vaulting of the main hall is divided into eight cross-
vaulted bays separated by transverse arches resting on a central
row of four pillars (plate 5.6). The use of pillars in the primary
structural fabric —as distinct from decorative embellishments —
is extremely rare in the Mamlik architecture of Jerusalem.
Their presence here led Clermont-Ganneau ** to suggest that
this hall was originally part of the Church of St. Michael, on the
assumption that, since the gate Bab al-Nazir is said by Mujir al-
Din® to have been known formerly as the Bab Mika’il, the Gate
of Michael, its name was derived from a church which Mujir al-
Din locates in this area (above, p. 133). The facade of the main
hall, though it incorporates Crusader elements, is obviously
Mamluk. As for the internal structure of the hall, this too seems
to be an original Mamlik construction. In the opinion of the
late Pere Charles Coiiasnon OP and of Professor Jaroslav Folda,
two noted experts in the field of Crusader architecture who
kindly examined this hall with me, the curious capitals on the
pillars are not Crusader and may well be Mamlik.*®° The capitals
are very plain. The northern one differs in detail from the other
three, but all are essentially of the same type. The capitals of the
three pillars of the western extension of the main hall (plate
5.7) are similar to those shown in fig. 5.8, albeit somewhat
smaller.

If the decorative features of the main hall indicate that it is
an original Mamluk construction, the variations in level and the
awkward plan suggest that not only was the street frontage
restricted by pre-existing structures to the east and west but that
the complex was bounded in part at least by other structures on
the south side.
 The courtyard is extremely large (approx. 28m x 23m).
The pointed-arched doors to the cells around the courtyard are
arranged more or less regularly, each surmounted by a tall
narrow opening for light and ventilation (see plates 5.8 and
5.9). The interior layout of the cells is far from regular,
however, doubtless as a result of the irregular boundary of the
pre-existing structures bordering the site. In one of the cells on
the south side of the courtyard the rear wall has been breached
 to link that cell with a large cross-vaulted room built against it.
The rear wall of the cells at the west side of the courtyard is,
unlike the other boundaries, quite straight and was pierced at
intervals by high-level windows (now blocked). This seems to
indicate that the wall was built anew as the western boundary of
the ribat. In a cell at the south-west corner, this wall has been
breached to link the ribat with the area to the west where, if our
interpretation of Mujir al-Din’s text is correct, are to be found
the Yunusiyya and Jaharkasiyya Madrasa.
 Two cisterns in the courtyard, marked 22 feet deep and
10% feet deep on the 1865 Ordnance Survey plan, are now
hidden under the modern shanties. The cistern head shown in
section on fig. 5.6 is a reconstruction based on Creswell’s
photographs (plates 5.8 and 5.9) together with fragments of it
found on the roof of the tzerba in 1979.

The fine pavement of the courtyard, still largely intact in
1920 (see plates 5.8 and 5.9), was finally destroyed when new
drains were laid in 1980 (see plate 5.10).

TURBA

In one of the cells on the north side of the courtyard there is an
anepigraphic cenotaph (plate 5.11). This must be the turba
which Mujir al-Din describes as being opposite the Hasaniyya
Madrasa (no. 55); he adds es it is said that it is the grave of
Sayyida Fatima bint Mu’ awiya’""' without giving further details of
this female’s identity.

The cell containing this cenotaph lies just to the west of the
moulding in the street wall, which appears to be Crusader as
mentioned above. It is certainly pre-Mamlik. The alignment of
the turba and of the adjoining cell to the east and the two cells
to the west is quite different from that of the other cells around
the courtyard (see plan, fig. 5.3). This different alignment
shows that all four cells at the west end of the north side of the
courtyard belong to an earlier construction.

The vaulting pattern of the two cells flanking the turba
reveals that originally there were no partition walls such as now
separate them from the turba, while the unusual vaulting of the
turba (see section, fig. 5.6) shows that it was originally covered
by a dome, replaced at some later date by the present cross
vault. The four wall arches of the turba are shaped to form the
extremities of corner pendentives (plate 5.12) in a very
distinctive manner which is encountered only in Crusader
architecture, except for one occurrence in an Islamic building,
at the Awhadiyya (no. 9), the dome of which is discussed below,
p.174. The walls and ceiling of the turba are entirely covered
with plaster and so it is not possible to check whether the
stonework of the wall arches bears masons’ marks or other
signs of Crusader workmanship. Several stones in the north,
west and south walls of the courtyard do, however, bear
masons’ marks and therefore it seems likely that they were
taken from some Crusader structure of which the present turba
once formed a part. The grave of Fatima bint Mu'awiya was
presumably installed under this domed structure just as the
grave of the Ayytbid ‘Shaykh Darbas’ was placed under the
dome of a Crusader chapel in the Jawiliyya complex (see
below, p. 205).

When the turba and its associated structures were
incorporated into the ribat, their south walls were refaced to
adjust their alignment to match that of the other, newly built
cells on the north side of the courtyard.

BUILDING TEAM

At Hebron there was a corbel table composed of fluted conchs
on consoles — the only example known to us that is similar to
the corbel table over the eastern facade of the Mansiri Ribat.
The example in Hebron was situated above the (anepigraphic)
entrance to the stairs leading to the Siqaya of Qalawiin, dated
679/1280-81 (plate 5.13). Unfortunately, that entrance was
demolished ia the 1960s but to judge from the published
photographs® it was similar in style to the entrance to the
Mansuri Ribat and probably dates from the period of Qalawin’s
restoration of the Haram in Hebron in 679/1280-81. Qalawiin’s
ribat in Hebron was built in the same year, but it too has
disappeared. Creswell records that its cross-vaulted entrance
bay (plate 5.14) bore a striking resemblance to that of the
Mansuri Ribat in Jerusalem. Moreover, the Superintendent of
the Two Harams, ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir, who almost certainly
superintended the construction of the Mansiri Ribat in
Jerusalem (above, p. 79), was probably also responsible for
superintending the building works of Qalawun in Hebron.‘
 These connections strongly suggest that the builders of
Qalawin’s ribat and siqaya in Hebron were also responsible,
under the superintendence of ‘Ala’ al-Din, for Qalawin’s ribat
 in Jerusalem. The fact that the texts of the foundation
inscriptions of the two ribats are almost identical in content and
epigraphic style supports this hypothesis.*°

45 Mujir al-Din (Mujir, 606) states that,“‘Ala’ al-Din built the mathara [Ablutions
Place] near the Masjid al-Sharif al-Nabawi’ [the Mosque of Medina] but this is
doubtless a solecism: the Mosque at Hebron is surely what was intended, as
Sauvaire has observed (H. Sauvaire, Histoire de Jérusalem et d’Hébron, Paris,
1876, 263 n. 2). The mathara must be the sigéya of Qalawiin, just as the mathara
in Jerusalem is (a development of) the sigaya of al-‘Adil which was restored by
‘Ala’ al-Din in 665/1267 (CIA (Ville), 104-5) for Qalawan and which, in a receipt
dated 707/108, is referred to as the Siqaya al-Mansiriyya (Linda S. Northrup and
Amal Abul-Hajj, ‘A Collection of Medieval Arabic Documents in the Islamic
Museum at the Haram al-Sarif, Arabica, xxv, 1978, 288).

is given by J.-A. Jaussen, ‘Inscriptions arabes de la ville d’Hébron’, B/FAO, xxv,

pilerims with food and lodging in his dav (1925). It was demolished in the 1960s.

Aydughdi b. ‘Abdallah, known as al-Kubaki. He died on
Friday, 5 Ramadan 688 (22 September 1289)*

 "
6,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","EXTERIOR (figs. 6.3-6.6)

The lowest visible course of masonry projects outwards about
0.05m to form a plinth on which the walls were erected. Seven
courses above that plinth the walls step back a further 0.03m
before rising four more courses to complete the cubic case
(plate 6.1). Much of this masonry is re-used: many of the stones,
especially in the south-east side, bear the marks of Crusader
tooling and several have masons’ marks. The west corner of the
building (plate 6.2) was quite dilapidated before 1874 when
Clermont-Ganneau made a drawing of it. 7 Tt was subsequently
repaired, as noticed by Schick in 1894.
 The cylindrical drum is built of four courses of ashlars. The
upper course contains a series of brackets that support a
projecting cavetto cornice at the base of the dome. These
brackets are of the two main types (though there are variations)
arranged more or less alternately around the drum (plate 6.3).?
Similar bracketed cornices are a fairly common feature in
Crusader architecture,!° and continued to be used in the
Ayyubid period.’ This is the only known Mamlik instance,
apparently composed of re-used Crusader elements.

The ashlar dome is raised on a base course with a bevelled
top edge that forms an angled step about 0.03m wide (see plate
6.1). The apex of the dome is fitted with a stone finial.

The windows in the north-east, south-east and south-west
walls are all identical, each having a monolithic lintel (which
does not course through with the mural masonry) surmounted
by an arcuated relieving lintel carved to simulate an arch of
simply joggled voussoirs, a relatively common device in the
second half of the seventh/thirteenth century.”

The entrance in the centre of the north-west side is set in
a recess spanned by a pointed and horseshoed trefoil arch
(plate 6.4).° On either side of the recess re-used Crusader
elbow consoles of different sizes support a deeply modelled
archivolt, probably composed of re-used voussoirs from a
Crusader building. A hoodmould with short lateral extensions
runs around the extrados of the arch; it is carved with a nail-
head pattern on the outer register and intricate diaperwork of
intersecting circles and semicircles on the inner register.

Plain stone benches flank the entrance door. The door
jambs are lightly carved with a delicate roll moulding. Above
the monolithic door lintel an arcuated relieving lintel has
counterfeit voussoirs similar to those over the window lintels.
The dedicatory inscription is placed one course above the
relieving lintel.

INTERIOR (plan, fig. 6.2; sections, figs. 6.7—6.9)

The entrance door, open until 1975, has been crudely blocked
up and cemented over. It led directly into the tomb, which is lit
by the windows in the other three walls. Two recesses on either
side of the door echo the two window embrasures in the
Opposite wall. The walls are plastered up to the level of the
zone of transition except for a panel of exposed ashlars
between the two windows in the south-east wall. This panel
contains the plain pointed-arched mihbrab, which is
semicircular in plan (see fig. 6.2).

The transition from square base to circular drum is
effected in two stages not expressed on the exterior other than
by the stepping back of the walls at a level which coincides with
the base of the zone of transition. The first stage of transition is
from square to octagon by means of duplex corner arches, one
arch inside the other, with mugarnas niches cut into the
springers and little fluted conchs set into the corners (see figs.
6.7-6.9; plate 6.5). This stage culminates in a cavetto cornice.
The transition from the octagonal cornice to the circular drum
is made simply by eight fluted conchs acting like miniature
 Squinches above the corners of the octagon. Another cavetto
cornice defines the conjunction between drum and dome.

In the middle of the paved stone floor the stone cenotaph
is oriented in the usual Muslim manner with its long axis
parallel to the qibla wall. It is a curious object, unparalleled in
Islamic architecture, and said to be Crusader work of the
eleventh or twelfth century.“ It has a curved gable-ended lid
with a ridge running along the full length and a deep bevelled
flange over the base, which has five blind arches in each side
and two in each end, and sits on a bevelled plinth (plate 6.6).
The blind arches at each end of the sides are decorated with
diaperwork similar to that on the hoodmould of the archivolt,
which may indicate a common soutce.
 1 At the time of van Berchem’s visit (1914) the building was known locally as
‘Qubbat al-‘Abed’ (C/A (Ville), 203 n. 3).

2 The exact orientation has unfortunately not been checked. The orientations
shown on modern maps are not consistent. Van Berchem remembered the gibla
wall as facing south-south-east (CIA (Ville), 203 n. 4), while Walls’s drawings show
the gibla wall facing almost directly south-east.

 "
7,"Il SITE AND BUILDINGS (/ig. 7.2)
","The siting of the Ribat of Kurt immediately outside Bab al-
Hadid in the Haram wall raises a question about the date of that
gate and its relation to the ribat. Al-“Umari, writing about fifty
years after the ribat was built, is the first to mention Bab al-
Hadid, and it cannot be identified with any of the gates listed by
Nasir-i Khusraw (438/1047) or earlier writers. Yet it must have
existed in 693/1293-94, since the ribat could hardly otherwise
have been sited where it is. It is not known exactly when the
gate was first opened, but the fact that the ribat is the earliest
building in Tariq Bab al-Hadid, and that the meandering route
of that street from Tariq al-Wad can have belonged to no ancient
street grid, suggest that the gate was opened precisely to give
access to the ribat. That would have caused a path to be beaten
up to it from Tariq al-Wad. At some later date the street was
resurfaced and its level raised, perhaps when the Bab al-Hadid
was rebuilt (¢.759/1358) by Arghtin al-Kamili and the
Arghiiniyya Madrasa (no. 32) built opposite the ribat. The level
was raised again by another resurfacing after 1920” so that one
now descends by two steps to the original threshold.

The present buildings’ on the site consist essentially of
two structurally discontinuous parts, south and north,
separated by a long open courtyard. The full extent of the
original ribat is difficult to determine owing to many later
additions and alterations.
 "
7,"Ill HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

Although the building is anepigraphic, identification is quite
easy as Mujir al-Din described it as being ‘at the Iron Gate,
contiguous with the wall [of the Haram and] opposite the
Arghiiniyya Madrasa’.* As there was no direct access from the
hospice into the Haram enclosure, al-‘Umari made no mention
of the Ribat Kurt in his descriptive work.

FOUNDER

If we continue with Mujir al-Din’s text’, we read: ‘It was
endowed by his honour (al-maqarr)° Sayf al-Din Kurt, saihib
(sic) of Egypt, in the year 693 [1294]. The founder is given more
flesh and blood by a younger contemporary, al-Dhahabi (673-
748/1274-1348): ‘Kurt, also called Kurd, the Amir Sayf al-Din al-
Mansuri, governor of Tripoli —an heroic and brave amir, one of
the noted champions. He was a religious and good man, who
was charitable and gave alms. He took an interest in the
 inhabitants of the Two Sanctuaries and has to his credit a
hospice (ribat) in Jerusalem and (other) fine works (mabasin).
He was a mamliik of the Amir Diya’ al-Din b. al-Khatir.’ The
Sultan Husam al-Din ([Lajin] appointed him  hdjib
(chamberlain). He fought very valiantly at the battle [of Wadi al-
Khazindar]® and killed several Mongols, then charged and
waded deep into them and met a martyr’s death (may God have
mercy upon him).”

From the information in other chronicles — if we take due
note of the permitted fluctuation between the spellings of Kurd
and Kurt — we may add further details to this outline career. In
687/1288 he was sent as military commissioner (mushidd)
along with a qadi to Safad to carry out an inspection but was
recalled within the month.!° A Kurd al-Saqi (Cup-bearer) was
among those arrested by ‘Alam al-Din al-Shuja'l in 693/1294."""" Is
this man to be identified with our founder? Probably not, as that
same year a Sayf al-Din Kurt is mentioned as one of the
chamberlains (bujjab).’* The Sultan Lajin made him hajib,
perhaps to be understood as ‘Chief Chamberlain’. Ibn
Taghribirdi added to the text of al-Dhahabi the phrase ‘after he
had become sultan’,’? which is strictly unnecessary but suggests
that the appointment was made not too long after Lajin’s
accession in 696/1296-97. It was perhaps a reward for Kurt’s role
in bringing Lajin to the throne.” The evidence for his having
held the post of Marshall (Amir Akhiir) is weal. Maqrizi writes
under the year 697/1297-98 that Sayf al-Din Kurt Amir Akhtr
was made governor of Tripoli after the death of his predecessor
‘Izz al-Din Aybak al-Mawsili.” Firstly, Aybak is commonly
reported to have died early in Safar of 698/November 1298
(although Magqrizi puts his death under both 697 and 698),'°
and secondly Kurt’s promotion to Tripoli is placed after the
return to power of al-Nasir Muhammad in Jumada I 698/
February 1299. Indeed one source specifies the month of Rajab
698/April 1299, which would leave room for a short
occupancy of the Tripoli post by Sayf al-Din Asandamur, who is
said to have followed ‘Izz al-Din Aybak and to have been in the
post at the time of al-Nasir’s restoration.’* Whether a Sayf al-Din
Kurt, the Marshall, was Aybak’s successor in 697/1297-98 is
therefore open to doubt, but it hardly seems possible to identify
him with our Kurt, especially as Maqrizi also reports the activity
of a ‘Kurt the Hajib’ in Cairo in the same year; and as it was the
chamberlain’s post which he vacated when he became
governor of Tripoli in 698/1299.?
 After the murder of Sultan Lajin, Kurt had been one of the
eight or nine members of the oligarchy of 2a jwho jointly
signed all state papers, until al-Nasir was recalled.”°

We last hear of him at the major battle against the Mongols
fought in Rabi’ I 699/December 1299. He was stationed on the
victorious left wing of the Mamluk army and, as we have seen,
met his death in action.”

It remains to comment on the strange text of Mujir al-Din
in which he describes Kurt as the sa@bib, that is, the Lord of
Egypt. It is probably not worth trying to explain the word itself
and one may cue put it down as an error for hajib
(chamberlain),” an office by which he was generally known.
We have seen that Kurt may well have been @ chamberlain, if
not the chamberlain, as early as 693/1294.

DATE
The only evidence is the statement by Mujir al-Din that the
endowment of the hospice was made in 693/1294.%

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

Next to nothing is known about this hospice. The Haram
documents are, as far as can be seen, quite silent concerning it.
A Hanafi qadi, Muhammad b. ‘Imran, in an endowment deed
dated to the year 916/1511, made a list of the beneficiaries from
the property he instituted as wagf.~"" In this list, after his son and
his mother, we find the bawwab of Kurt’s hospice, the Shaykh,
the hospice residents (ujawirs), and then the Muslim poor
generally, all these in descending priority. This suggests that the
hospice was still functioning in some fashion right at the end of
the Mamluk period.
 Asali quotes from a later sijill, dated 1055-56/1645-46,” to
list repairs at an estimated cost of sixty piastres carried out on
‘part of the vault of the lower iwdn . . . its eastern wall .. . the
dividing wall between the hospice and the Jawhariyya Madrasa,
and the roof of the hospice and the two kitchens, etc.’ He also
remarks on the ‘partial collapse’ of the building as a result of
Israeli excavations in 1971. The building i is at present occupied
by members of the al-Shihabi family.”°

In 962/1555 an inventory was made of the belongings of a
woman who died ‘while a resident (mujawira) in the Women’s
Hospice in the Bab al-Hadid’.”’ It is not clear exactly which
institution is intended. There is no reason at all to believe that
Kurt's Hospice was reserved for women. Other texts refer to a
‘Hospice of the Sultan’ in the quarter of Bab al-Hadid (see pp.
131, 343 n. 6, and 557).
 STREET FRONTAGE (fig. 7.5)

The present street frontage is three storeys high, but only the
lowest storey belongs to the Ribat of Kurt al-Mansiri. The
middle storey was added in 844/1440 with the adjoining
construction of the Jawhariyya Madrasa (no. 58) as shown by
the continuity of the masonry. There is a slight bend in the street
alignment corresponding to the junction between the ribat and
the later madrasa (fig. 7.3). The lateral extent and the height of
the ribat may also be seen in a horizontal quirked ogee
moulding, which must originally have formed a cornice as the
water spout near the middle of the moulding, implying a roof
behind, shows (plate 7.1).

The diminutive entrance doorway (plate 7.2) is set in a
shallow recess with a slightly stilted pointed arch at the eastern
end of the frontage, next to Bab al-Hadid. The usual stone
benches flanking the doorway have been built up at some time
 after 1920 when Creswell’s photograph (plate 7.2) was taken. A
relieving arch over the lintel is composed of three voussoirs
with rebated joints, and above, in the tympanum of the arched
recess, a small window (now blocked) is discernible.

In the western part of the frontage an irregular half-arch,
around which the stonework is recessed two or three
centimetres, is obviously a later repair (plate 7.1). The apex of
this half-arch coincides with the abutment of a relatively
modern strainer arch spanning the street at this point to
buttress the frontage against the Arghtiniyya Madrasa opposite.
From the presence of a lintel stone and the disposition of the
masonry below it (fig. 7.5), it appears that there was once a
window in the western half of the frontage intended to light the
main hall of the ribat (see plan, fig. 7.3).
 INTERIOR (jig. 7.3)

(@) The southern structures

The entrance doorway opens into a long passage (plate 7.3)
which runs north into a small yard open to the sky, from which
an archway on the west (now partly blocked) leads into a cross-
yaulted antechamber to the main hall of the ribat lying to the
west of the passage. The doorway to the main hall is placed
eccentrically in the south wall of the antechamber, it is
unremarkable apart from the unusual feature of flanking stone
benches on the inside.”® The corners of the hall are extruded in
order to reduce the span of the cross vault. In the middle of the
hall there is a buttress (see fig. 7.3) which was added later; its
function, to support the floor above, is further confirmation
that the first floor is a later addition, as indicated by the masonry
of the frontage.

Above the entrance passage there is a low narrow room
(dotted lines on plan, fig. 7.3) originally reached by a staircase
in the thickness of the wall separating the passage from the
main hall. This is now blocked and the room is accessible only
by climbing through a window in its north wall. There was a
second small window at the south end of the room, looking out
above the entrance portal. The ceiling of the room is at the
same level as that of the main hall.

Its different alignment and lack of structural integration
show that the antechamber is a later addition to the main hall.
(ii) Courtyard
From the small yard beside the antechamber a passageway
 leads northward to the courtyard of the ribat. On either side of
the passageway are groups of structures of a later date than the
main hall. Those on the west side, reached by a door in the
north wall of the antechamber, are too dilapidated and overlaid
with debris for their period to be established. From the quality
of the stone dressing, both they and the antechamber appear to
be pre-Ottoman and could well form part of the Jawhariyya
additions made in 844/1440 (p. 562). To the east of the
passageway and against the Haram wall are two cells (marked
‘B’ and ‘C’ on the plan) with doors (both blocked) in the north
and south walls respectively. Six out of nine pointed arches in
these later additions have the unusual feature of a median joint
(plate 7.4). Several arches in the Jawhariyya share this feature.

The courtyard is dominated by the high wall of the Haram
(see below) which forms its east boundary. The original west
boundary is indeterminate: the lower part of the present wall is
buried under a heap of rubble (plate 7.5). It seems very likely
that the original west boundary was in line with the west wall of
the main hall.

(iti) Northern structures

At the north end of the courtyard the buildings have no direct
structural connection with those parts of the ribat that confront
the street. This lack of connection and the absence of distinctive
architectural features make it very difficult to determine which
parts may belong to the original ribat. To make matters worse,
many of the structures at ground level are now sealed off and
inaccessible. Nevertheless, certain elements are manifestly
Ottoman and by eliminating these we can reduce the number
of possible components of the ribat.

At the north end of the courtyard is an zwvdan composed of
two vaults, of which the outer one facing the courtyard (plate
7.6) is higher and, like the structure it supports, is obviously
Ottoman. The priority of the inner vault upon which the outer
vault abuts is indisputable. The stonework of the inner vault is
dressed in a manner similar to that of the street frontage and we
believe that this zwvdém forms part of the original construction.
There were two blocked openings in the rear (north) wall; both
are blocked now. During repairs made in 1971-72 these
openings were unblocked briefly (see plate 7.7), but the
heavily plastered walls and vaults of the chamber thus revealed
betrayed no distinctive characteristics. However, the vaulted
ceiling is somewhat lower than that of the zwdn (see fig. 7.6)
and this leads us tentatively to suggest that this northern
chamber is earlier, possibly connected with the Ayyubid
 structures to the north which come between the Mansuri Ribat
and the Haram wall (above, p. 132).

There are two openings in the west wall of the inner vault
of the zvdn. The northern one is blocked and remained so
during the aforementioned repairs; nothing is known of the
area beyond. The one to the south houses a staircase leading to
the upper floor.

At the head of the staircase (plate 7.8) there are two
passages which lead (a) west to connect ultimately with the roof
of the Ribat al-Manstri and (b) east (plate 7.9) into a much-
partitioned yard overshadowed by the Haram wall to the east
and a three-storey Ottoman addition to the north (see fig. 7.6).
From their architectural relationship, the zwan, the staircase
and the small room immediately to the north of it at first floor
level as well as the cross-vaulted room directly over the inner
vault of the 7wan may be contemporaneous, i.e. be part of the
original ribat. Other rooms at first floor level may also belong
to the ribat but the anonymity of the architecture precludes
positive identification. At second and third floor levels the
architecture is easily identified as Ottoman in its entirety (plate
7.10).

HARAM WALL
The outer face of the Haram wall,” which forms the eastern
boundary of the ribat, is exposed along the length of the
courtyard (plate 7.11). This affords us a rare opportunity to
examine a continuous stretch of the wall in relation to the
adjoining Mamluk structures. The two lowest courses, each
approximately 0.90m high, seem to belong to the Umayyad
rebuilding of the wall since the stone dressing and the height of
the courses correspond closely to that of the masonry at those
Haram gates which we have ascribed (above, p. 45) to the
Umayyad period (cf. below, pp. 156 and 174). Above these two
courses the smaller masonry of the wall appears to be
homogeneous (apart from isolated repairs) to the very top, a
height corresponding to the roof of the Mamlik portico (no.
12). A systematic survey of the masonry types in Jerusalem is
needed to determine whether the upper part of the wall
belongs to a phase of Umayyad construction or, as seems more
likely, to a later reconstruction. All that can be safely inferred at
present is that this part of the wall was built before the ribat
which abuts it.
 AYU

1 The name of the founder is spelt variously Kurd and Kurt in Mamluk sources:
of seven historians who mention Kurt/Kurd al-Mansiri, three use ‘Kurt’, two use
‘Kurd’ and two, Mufaddal and al-Maqrizi, use both indiscriminately. In Turkish
dialects there is a tendency not to distinguish between voiced and un-voiced final
consonants; thus kurt/kurd/kurt, ‘wolf (Sir Gerard Clauson, An Etymological
Dictionary of Pre-Thirteenth Century Turkish, Oxford, 1972, 648). The spelling
Kurt has been adopted, which, though not the spelling used by Mujir al-Din, is
nonetheless the commonest in the sources. This spelling also avoids confusion
possible with Kurd, which might be taken erroneously to imply a Kurdish origin.

","The only entrance, from Tariq Bab al-‘Atm, opens directly into
the courtyard of the khanqah. Vaulted cells flank the west, north
and east sides of the courtyard. On the south side three cells,
larger than the others, occupy the south-east corner, and are
adjoined to the west by a vaulted hall, which we shall call the
‘assembly hall’. A smaller vaulted chamber in the south-west
corner opens off the assembly hall. There is no mibrab.

At the north-east corner of the courtyard a doorway in the
east wall leads to a lobby which houses the entrance to a
staircase leading to the roof. A door under the staircase gives
access to a large, irregularly-shaped room, while a door in the
north wall leads under a cross vault to a small yard, open to the
sky. A long tunnel vault extends northwards from the yard. We
shall refer to this group consisting of the irregularly-shaped
room, the cross vault, open yard and tunnel vault as the
‘northern annexes’.

Part of the north portico of the Haram extends along the
southern boundary wall of the khangah. A ninth/fifteenth
century madrasa has been built over this part of the Haram
portico. The numerous other constructions at first and second
floor level, built on the roof of the khanqah, belong to a later
development of the site (see below, p. 519).

","SSA £240 RV AE

IDENTIFICATION

Above the door, yet often unnoticed because of the gloom of
the vaulted street, the foundation inscription may still be found.
Mujir al-Din places what he calls the Duwaydariyya Madrasa at
the Gate of the Glory of the Prophets, and notes that part of the
Basitiyya is built over it? Al“Umari had merely mentioned the
‘three grilles belonging to the ribat (sic) of al-‘Alami al-
Dawadari® in the north portico of the Haram, west of the
Awhadiyya grille (see p. 167).

DATE

The inscription is dated ‘the commencement of the year 695
[late 1295).4 Mujir al-Din repeats the same date, but it is more
than likely that he merely echoes the inscription. However, he
also tells us that he saw a copy of ‘Alam al-Din Sanjar’s waqfiyya,
the date of which was 7 Rabi‘ I 696/3 January 1297.

The discrepancy of a little over a year between the date of
the inscription and the reported date of the waqf document
does not admit of a single confident explanation. One could
 claim that the inscription, which refers to what is manifestly a
summary of the endowment deed, must have been executed
after the date of that deed (696/1297). Why then was the
inscription dated 695/1295? Is that the date of the
commencement, rather than the more usual completion date?
Was the inscription added a while after the completion of the
building? Or was there more than one act of endowment?
 PUL LEN
The founder may be styled in full the Amir ‘Alam al-Din Abu
Misa Sanjar b. ‘Abdallah al-Burunli al-Turki al-Salihi al-Najmi
al-Dawadari. He was born in the 620s, or if we follow al-Birzali,
in 628/1230-31, and ‘arrived’, that is, was imported into the
Mamluk state, in the 640s/1242-1252.° Described as ‘one of the
last Salihiyya’ (the mamluks of the Ayyabid al-Malik al-Salih), he
began his career under Baybars as amir and mushidd
(intendant) in Aleppo.® Having been transferred to Damascus,
he was, on the death of Baybars, left in charge of the citadel
there.’ He supported the bid for power made by Sunqur al-
Ashqar but without permanent damage to his own career. By
680/1281 Qalawin had given him wide administrative powers
throughout the Syrian territories.? Three years later he was
dismissed from the post of Intendant of the Bureaux (shddd al-
dawdawin) at Damascus’ and in late 687/early 1289 we find him
serving as district governor (waz) in Behesna in Egypt.””
Subsequently, under Sultan Khalil, Sanjar was responsible
for organising the siege artillery for the assault on Acre in 690/
1291,” and, after its fall, for dismantling the fortifications of the
last Frankish possessions, including the transfer to Cairo of the
Gothic , doorway that later formed part of al-Nasir’s madrasa
there.’* He spent a year imprisoned in the citadel of Cairo poe
was released in late 691/1292 and given an amirate in Egypt.’
By Sultan Kitbugha he was commissioned to receive the
Oirat Mongol refugees and settle them on the Syrian coast near
‘Atlit.“ Lajin, in his sultanate, despatched him as commander of
a campaign against Sis in Lesser Armenia, where he was
wounded,” Finally, under al-Nasir Muhammad, he was present
at the battle against the Mongols led by Ghazan Khan, which
was fought near Homs on Wednesday, 28 Rabi’ I 699/23
December 1299. After the battle he took refuge in Hisn al-Akrad
(Krak des Chevaliers) where he died on the eve of Friday 3
Rajab 699/25 March 1300,'° and ‘was buried in the cemetery
there, called the “Martyrs”.’!”
 His good administration, his personal piety and
scholarship and his association with, and patronage of, the
religious classes, are lauded. ‘His house was more like a
mosque’, says one enthusiastic admirer. * He established waqfs
in Jerusalem and Damascus and was made responsible by Lajin
for the restoration of the mosque of Ibn Tilin in Cairo and of
its financial resources.”

ENDOWMENT

The foundation inscription,”° despite its length, must be given
in full, because it supplies details of the no longer extant
wagfiyya, and the purposes of the foundation and the financial
resources provided:

In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate. The
construction of this blessed khanqah, called the House of
the Pious,”? was ordered by the servant needful of God
Almighty, the servant of God, son of the servant of the Lord,
son of the servant of the Creator,” Sanjar al-Dawadari al-
Salihi. He made it a waqf, in his desire for the countenance
of God Almighty, in favour of thirty persons from the
community of Sifis and novices, Arab and non-Arab,
twenty of whom shall be unmarried and ten married, to
dwell there without leaving, not in summer, winter, spring
nor autumn, except on specific business; and to give
hospitality to those Sufis and novices who visit, for a
period of ten days. It was endowed with the village of Bir
Nabala® in the district of Jerusalem, and the village of
Hajla in the district of Jericho, and an oven and mill, and
yeaa ty atin Onin Aaa boone nnlomncalemumandiashancened
 soap factory, six shops and a paper mill in Nablus, and
three orchards, three shops and four mills in Beisan. This
endowment is for the khanqah, and for the teaching of the
school of law of al-Shafit, and for a shaykh to give
instruction in Prophetic Tradition and a Koran reader with
whom the Koran will be studied,” and for ten persons to
study Tradition and for ten persons to recite the Book of
God in full each day, and a panegyrist to chant the praise
of the Prophet, all this in the Aqsa Mosque. This was done
at the commencement of the year six hundred and ninety-
five [1295] under the supervision of the needful of God,
Sanjar al-Qaymari, may God forgive him.

The endowment for this blessed khanqah and the
aforementioned offices also includes the village of
Tubrus” in the district of Qaqin and the Queen’s Bath at
Nablus the Protected.

The work of the Master ‘Ali b. Salama, the architect.

This foundation of his in Jerusalem clearly reflects his own
interests. He himself was attracted to the Sifi life. He dressed as
a fair, adopted an ascetic way of life and observed a period of
retreat at Mecca. Hence, as we have seen, the basic provision in
his khanqah for thirty resident Stfis and for the reception of
visiting Sufis. His deep interest in traditional religious learning
is represented by the arrangements for a teacher and ten
students in both Koran and Tradition. One should note that
these were not directly associated with the khanqah but were to
form part of the general educational activities of the Aqsa
Mosque. It is not clear to us whether the teaching of Shafi'i law
was also external to the khanaah. We tend to believe that it was.
 There was a close tie between Sanjar and a Shafi lawyer
named Sharaf al-Din Qasim. Sanjar specified in his wagfiyya
that Qasim was to be overseer (musharif) of his madrasa,”’ as
our source here calls it, alongside Sanjar’s son, Amir Jamal al-
Din Musa, who was to be inspector (nazir). Musa in the event
died before his father.”

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

The name of the Haram Gate, the Dawadariyya Gate, was a
constant reminder of the khanqah, but no mention of its waqf
could be found in any of the Ottoman land registers available
for consultation. Equally, searching through the Jerusalem
sijills has — perhaps merely by chance — produced not a single
reference to this institution. Only in the Haram documents
have we met with indirect mention of it. In one, no. 684, dated
Rabi‘ I 790/March 1388, the then Shaykh of the Khanqah is
named, Jamal al-Din Ahmad b. Sa‘d al-Din Muhammad b. al-
Mughani.” A waqf house belonging to it was situated in the
Wad Street according to no. 504, dated to the end of 793/
November 1391. There is an inventory of books®? which were
found in ‘the house of the Dawadariyya’ — another waqf
property? — and also a list of the belongings of a mamluk,
Yalbugha b. ‘Abdallah, including a Koran, a part of a Koran, and
another volume! which were held in the khanqah, here
referred to, with an echo of the inscription over its portal, as
‘the Hospice (ribat) of the Pious’.

Burhan al-Din Ibrahim b. Jama‘a (805-72/1402-67) taught
in the Dawadariyya.* Much later on, in 1010/1601-2, two
members of the Muhandis family shared half the bawwab and
Shaykh positions.”
 HARAM FRONTAGE (fig. 8.5)

Two water spouts, implying a roof behind, give the original
height of the Haram portico (no. 12). The fagade above the
portico is remarkable for the variety of its architectural features,
notably a fine double-arched window flanked by columns, a
group of three rectangular windows with a small blind triple
window above all set in a shallow recess, and a blocked
doorway half-way up the wall with no obvious means of
approach.*4 Under the central part of the facade runs a billet
moulding which recurs in the western part of the facade at a
higher level above the doorway.

The upper floor over the portico was taken by van
Berchem”? to be part of the khanqah. But we have the literary
evidence of Mujir al-Din*® that there is a certain Basitiyya
Madrasa (no. 53) built in the ninth/fifteenth century ‘partly
over’ (ba‘duba ald) the Dawadariyya. Certain features of the
facade confirm Mujir al-Din’s statement. Three in particular,
the muqarnas decoration of the voussoirs of the doorway
arch,” the small twin window with a circular window above®®
and the billet moulding,” were not introduced to Jerusalem
until the ninth/fifteenth century. Consequently the upper floor,
over the portico, should be considered as belonging not to the
khangah butto the Basitiyya Madrasa (see below, pp.519-525).

The frontage of the khanq&h itself is obscured by the
Haram portico“ and is devoid of pretension, being punctuated
only by five rectangular windows.*! The two westernmost
windows open in infill walls blocking two round-headed
archways (plate 8.1) identical in form to the archway of the
present Bab al-‘Atm. All three archways were originally open,
forming a triple gateway into the Haram, built probably in
Umayyad times (see above, p. 45). The jambs of both windows
are built partly of ablag masonry and the flat relieving arches
above the monolithic lintels are decorated with red ablaq
voussoirs identical to those of the relieving arches over the
windows in the north wall of the assembly hall (see below, p.
162). Therefore we may assume that these two eastern bays of
the triple gateway were blocked up at the time of construction
of the khanqah. The central window must be contemporaneous
 with the western ones. It is the same size as the western
windows and has similar ablag jambs but lacks their decorated
relieving arches. It may well take the place ofan earlier opening
made in the Haram wall before the construction of the portico,
for the vaulting of the adjacent bay of the portico is awkwardly
arranged in order to avoid blocking the window (fig. 8.3). The
two eastern windows are quite plain. Their splayed embrasures
in the Haram wall are skewed in order (a) to place the western
window under the centre ofa portico vault (see fig. 8.3) and (b)
to allow the eastern window to clear the springing of the
adjacent portico vault. These adjustments suggest that these
windows were cut in the Haram wall after the portico had been
built (see above, p. 107).

ENTRANCE ( plate 8.2, fig. 8.4)

The magnificent entrance portal is set towards the centre of the
otherwise plain street facade (fig. 8.4). The portal recess is
constructed of red and cream-coloured ablag up to the level of
the springing of the vault. The masonry of the recess extends
irregularly onto the facade (fig. 8.4, plate 8.2), the plain
limestone courses of which are generally deeper than the
 ablag courses of the portal. This shows that the portal has been
built into the adjoining masonry and may have been the last
part of the facade to have been built, as was apparently
customary Mamlik procedure.”

The entrance bay is 3.10m wide and 2.03m deep, with
stone benches on either side, each framed by a quirked ogee
moulding (fig. 8.3). At the back is the entrance proper 1.55m
wide and 2.45m high with a monolithic lintel and ablag joggled
relieving arch, the alternate voussoirs being of red stone.

The foundation inscription, above the relieving arch, runs
across the three sides of the bay and is continued at the right-
hand side onto a lower course (plate 8.3). A circular
medallion® lightly carved with vegetal motifs is incorporated
within the main band of inscription, over the door, and at the
left-hand end a semicircular escutcheon (plate 8.4) bears the
muallim’s ‘signature’.“* On the street facade two ornamental
carved stone roundels, each evidently intended to take a central
boss, distinguish the extremities of the main inscription. There
are somewhat similar unfinished-looking roundels in the side
walls at the level of the lower band of inscription (pate 8.3).

The vaulting of the portal recess (plate 8.5, fig. 8.4) is a
veritable tour de force of the mw allim, ‘Ali b. Salama. Three
tiers of muqarnas corbels, the lower two functioning as
pendentives, culminate in two monolithic fluted cupolas with
metal rings hanging from the apexes. Similar three-tiered
muqarnas imposts support the base of the vault on three sides
while on the outer (street) side (fig. 8.4) the thrust of the vault
is discharged through two pointed trefoil arches to the imposts,
of which the central one, seemingly defying structural logic, is
suspended. From this suspended impost the thrust is first
transferred to the upper structure whence it is discharged
down through the lateral imposts (see fig. 8.8). In this system
there is a structural necessity to support the upper units
marked ‘a’ on the sketch (fig. 8.8) of the trefoil arches. This is
achieved by the upward tapering of the suspended impost in a
series of inward overlaps up to the point where a small and
almost imperceptible outward joggle keys the impost into the
large stone cantilevers (‘b’) which discharge the load. The tip of
the suspended impost is drilled, no doubt to permit a hanging
lamp to heighten the dramatic effect of instability. The
mu allim continues to perplex the observer by joggling the
ablag voussoirs of the enclosing pointed arch not in one plane
but two (plate 8.6). How this was done is unknown but since
the voussoirs are relatively simply joggled, with no re-entrant
angles, it would have been possible to build up the arch from
each side before sliding ina keystone whose joggling was cut at
an acute angle to match the two adjoining voussoirs (fig. 8.9).

The system of vaulting adopted for the portal of the
khanqah was not original, however. In Damascus an
evolutionary series of similar vaults survives. The prototype is
the Nuriyya Madrasa (567/1172),” followed by the ‘Adiliyya
 Madrasa (619/1222-23),‘° and the Qilijiyya Madrasa (651/1253-
54)” which had four bays rather than two. The vaulting of the
khangah portal bears a striking resemblance to that of the
‘AdiliyyainDamascus (fig. 8.10) andwascertainly inspired by ie

In all the Damascene examples a cornice moulding
crowns the facade, rising over the door to form a sort of
rectangular pediment of a type that originated in the East and
which is called pish-taq in Persian. The upper part of the facade
of the Jerusalem khanqah is hidden behind a range of later
yaults spanning the street, but there can be little doubt that a
similar moulded cornice and pish-taq were used here also. The
moulded imposts for these later vaults are seventh/thirteenth
century in scale and profile and are almost certainly re-used
sections of the original cornice moulding of the khanqah. A
 5.75m length of the same cyma moulding has been re-
employed over the recessed unit of three windows of the
Basitiyya Madrasa (plate 53.1), possibly as part of the later
repairs to that building (see above, p. 156). There the moulding
terminates at either end in a discontinuous down-turn: these
must be the very stones which formed the top corners of the
original pish-taq of the khanqah.”

INTERIOR (plan, fig. 8.3)

The entrance door leads directly into the courtyard where a
modern concrete wall has been erected to screen the interior
from the view of passers-by.”” More modern is the jazzy dado
around the walls of the courtyard, visible in plate 8.7; it was
painted in the late 1970s. The same plate shows the fine original
pavement composed of big limestone slabs that remains largely
intact.

At the south-west corner of the courtyard a niche (plate
8.8) in the west wall houses a well-head where water could be
drawn from a cistern below. The sculptural detail of the
mugarnas corbelling and relief-carved semidome covering the
niche (plate 8.9) is encrusted with paint and_ virtually
indecipherable.

The layout of cells round the courtyard is shown on the
plan (fig. 8.3). Each cell has a typical Mamluk pointed-arched
doorway and is lit and ventilated by a high-level slit window
placed either directly over the door or to one side of it but
always immediately under the crown of the vault. In the east
wall several of these windows and two doors have been
subsequently enlarged. Each of the two cells occupying the
south-eastern corner of the khanqah has in addition a window
penetrating the southern wall to overlook the Haram.

Many of the partition walls between the cells in the north
and east walls have been demolished to form larger rooms,
possibly when the building was converted for use as a school
some time before 1914. A modern flight of steps in the south-
east corner of the courtyard (plate 8.14) blocks the windows of
the adjacent cells and is probably part of the same conversion.
 Acornice moulding, similar in profile but smaller than the
cornice moulding from the street facade, running round three
sides of the courtyard defines the original height of the walls (it
has been replaced on the east side by a plain string course of a
type common in architecture of the nineteenth century in
Jerusalem).

ASSEMBLY HALL
In the western part of the southern wall of the courtyard, the
important position of the assembly hall is expressed in a
symmetrical arrangement of three shallow recesses (plate
8.10). The central recess, which contains the entrance door, has
a pointed horseshoe arch; the lateral recesses, containing
rectangular windows, have pointed arches. The decoration of
the recess is obscured by several coats of paint but the main
features may still be observed. The jambs of the door and both
windows are constructed in ablaq, with alternate courses of red
stone. The flat relieving arches over the windows are
composed of distinctively joggled ablaq voussoirs, and incised
six-lobed rosettes decorate the tympanums. Over the door the
ablag voussoirs of the relieving arch are joggled with a profile
different from those over the windows. The oculus in the
tympanum (now blocked) is surrounded by a circular
composition of ablaq voussoirs within a moulded frame.
Three steps lead up into the assembly hall, which is
vaulted in three bays. Transverse arches divide the vaulting
bays. The large south-facing window under the eastern bay
opens under the Haram portico (above, p. 156). Under the
 western vaulting bay the semicircular arch of the easternmost
bay of the Umayyad triple gate may be seen (plate 8.11). Adoor
in the west wall of the assembly hall leads to a cross-vaulted
chamber, the south wall of which is formed by the central bay
of the triple gate. Both these bays of the triple gate are built up,
save for one window in each looking out on the Haram from
under the portico (above, p. 156). The sills of these windows
are only 0.10m above the internal floor level but an average of
1.74m above the floor level of the Haram portico (fig. 8.7)

STAIRCASE
At the north-east corner of the courtyard the door leading to the
lobby and staircase is differentiated from the doors of the cells
by its greater height and width and by its flat lintel surmounted
by a relieving arch. The design of the staircase is illustrated in
fig. 8.11. Plate 8.12 shows the system of half-arches supporting
the staircase, together with a high-level window which lights
the lobby, and the doors leading to the northern annexes. Since
all the buildings at first floor level are of later construction, this
staircase, which was undoubtedly built as an integral part of the
khangah, originally led to the flat roofs of the khanqah and the
adjoining Haram portico.
 NORTHERN ANNEXES

The large, irregularly shaped room entered through a door in
the east wall of the lobby in the north-east corner of the
courtyard is now so full of rubbish that a detailed examination
has not been possible. The plan shows that the north wall is
considerably longer than the south wall and that, in order to
facilitate vaulting over this irregular space, corner abutments
have been introduced to reduce the span of the northern end
of the cross vault. The upper part of a blocked doorway in the
south wall is visible above the rubbish. The sill of the window
in the east wall is barely one metre above floor level but almost
three metres above the level of the courtyard it overlooks.

The curious way in which the northern annexes project
from an otherwise more or less regular quadrilateral layout on
plan instantly suggests that here we have some part of a pre-
Mamluk construction which was taken over by the builders of
the khanqah. Furthermore, the fine ashlar masonry of much of
the structure, the pointed arches of the east and west side
recesses (a later, Ottoman fireplace has been built in front of
the west recess), and the deep cavetto moulding running round
the upper walls of the yard to form a cornice (visible in plate
8.13), are of pre-Mamliik — Crusader or Ayyubid — type.

The plan (fig. 8.3) shows that the north — south axis of the
northern annexes lies at right angles both to the northern
boundary wall of the khanqah and to the south side of the street
called Tariq al-Mujahidin. In other words, the north wall of the
khangah runs parallel to the south side of the street, not parallel
to the north wall of the Haram.

The surface dressing of the coursed ashlar masonry of the
south side of Tariq al-Mujahidin is at this point typically
Crusader; the series of masons’ marks to be seen on several
stones that appear to be in their original setting is good
evidence of Crusader construction. The eastern extent of the
Crusader wall is given by the vertical joint marked ‘V’ on the
plan and visible in plate 37.3. The high vaulted passageway
(shown in cross-section on fig. 8.6) which isolates the tunnel-
vaulted gallery of the northern annexes from the street is
panes with the Crusader street wall (below, p.
301).

Thus we have the north and south sides of a rectangular
structure, and the position of the east side. One side is of
Crusader construction, the other two almost certainly so. The
fact that the fourth side belongs to the Mamlak Sallamiyya
Madrasa (no. 25, built c. 738/1338) which now occupies most of
the area between the khanqah and the street need not concern
us here, for the unavoidable inference is that, in 695/1295 at
least, the north and south walls and the eastern vaults of some
 unidentified Crusader building occupied the site immediately
to the north of the khanqah, thereby determining the northern
boundary of the khanqah. The southern boundary was
determined by the north wall of the Haram, and the western
boundary by the need to leave space for the street leading to the
western bay of the Umayyad triple gate into the Haram.

So the irregular plan of the Dawadariyya Khanqah is no
accident but the direct result of building within the confines of
a gap site. Indeed, the increasing thickness from west to east of
the north wall of the assembly hall is a conscious attempt on the
part of the builders to disguise the irregularity by allowing the
southern face of the wall to follow the alignment of the Haram
wall and by adjusting the northern face of the wall to suit the
alignment of the northern boundary.’ The appropriation of
the northern annexes was inevitable once the only means of
access to them was through the khangah.

1 Bab al-‘Atm was in Mamluk times referred to first as Bab Sharaf al-Anbiya’ and
later, after the construction of the Dawadariyya, as Bab Duwaydariyya (cf. CIA
(Ville), 216 n. 2). the name changed to Bab al-‘Atm, ‘the Gate of Darkness’,
presumably after the street was covered with vaults, obscuring the light, in the
Ottoman period. Today it is referred to also as Bab al-Malik Faysal since it was
through this gate that King Faysal of Iraq entered the Haram during his visit in
1930, as an inscription on the eastern pier commemorates.

37 The mugarnas decoration of the arch is unusual. In Jerusalem one other
example of such a technique is known to us: over the well-niche in the
‘Uthmaniyya Madrasa (840/1437), see plate 57.10. A somewhat similar form of
decoration on the portal of the Jami‘ al-Utrush (811/1409) at Aleppo (CIA (Alep),
pl. clvii) appears to derive from the analogous decoration on the seventh/
thirteenth-century Saljiiq Hans in Anatolia (see, e.g., D. Hilland O. Grabar, Islamic
Architecture and its Decoration, London 1967, pls. 349, 429, 469, 489, 490).

38 Groups of windows arranged thus were very common in Mamlak Egypt and
Creswell has proposed a Sicilian origin for them (MAE, ii, 201). There are, besides
 this example, only two others in Jerusalem: in the courtyard of the Hasaniyya
Madrasa (837/1434) and above the entrance to the Sallamiyya Madrasa (see p.
303). The Basitiyya example is the earliest (c. 834/1431) in Jerusalem.

39 The first directly dated examples of this moulding in Jerusalem are at: Well of
Ibrahim al-Rami (839/1435-36): the ‘Uthmaniyya Madrasa (840/1437) and the
Jawhariyya Madrasa (844/1440). Given this close sequence of occurrences we
should be justified in considering the example at the Basitiyya Madrasa (waqf 834/

1431) as the earliest.
40 The portico is now blocked up with concrete partition walls. Plate 53.1 shows

the portico as it was in 1920.

41 Al‘Umari (Masalik, 158) only counted the three largest (westernmost)
windows of ‘the Ribat of al-‘Alami al-Dawadari’ when enumerating the features of
the north wall of the Haram.

42 Baybars al-Jashankir, for instance, began construction of his khangah/
mausoleum in Cairo in 706/1306. First he built the mausoleum, then the khanqah
unit in 707/1307, and the facade was added when he became sultan in 708/1308-9
and completed in 709/1310, see: al-Maqrizi, Khitat, ti, 416-17; Creswell, Brief

ignores it’. In fact van Berchem explains that he was unable to photograph the
doorway because of the poor light but he does devote ten pages to the building
and its inscription.

48 Van Berchem (CIA (Ville), 220 n.3) remarks that the khangah in Jerusalem was
(in 1914) known locally as the ‘Adiliyya although no-one was able to explain the
reason for this appellation. Van Berchem speculates that it may have been due to
the founder’s post as Intendant of the Palace of Justice (Dar al-‘Adl),

49 Altogether 15.5 metres of the moulding are still identifiable, including the
imposts on both sides of the street and the section over the Basitiyya. The length
of the street facade of the khanqah, from Bab al-‘Atm at the south to the Sallamiyya
Madrasa at the north, is 21.75m.

50 This is one of the few examples in Jerusalem of the Syrian (i.e. Damascene and
Aleppan) penchant for direct entrances into religious buildings. The usual
Jerusalem practice was to have a bent entrance, presumably for privacy.

51 The same technique was carried to extremes by the Cairene builders of urban
tombs. There the problem was one of adjusting the interior alignment towards
Mecca when a variant exterior alignment was indicated by the street layout: C,

IDENTIFICATION

Al-Umari describes the portico that continues westwards
immediately after the Bab Hitta in the north range of the Haram:
‘In the wall there are three grilles belonging to the Ribat of
‘Alam al-Din al-Dawadari, but at the beginning of it to the east
nearby (?) is a grille window of the Awhadiyya Mausoleum...”
The portico from the Bab Hitta westwards to the next gate, the
Dawadariyya Gate, had probably been built by al-Awhad.”

FOUNDER AND DATE
Mujir al-Din’s text is succinct and useful:

The Awhadiyya Mausoleum at Bab Hitta was founded by al-
Malik al-Awhad Najm al-Din Yisuf b. al-Malik al-Nasir Salah
al-Din Da’id b. al-Malik al-Mu‘azzam ‘Isa. The date of the
eneovamein was 20 Rabi‘ II in the year 697 [4 February
1298].

The founder was an Ayyabid prince, a great-great-nephew
of Saladin, in the direct line descended from Saladin’s brother,
al-‘Adil Sayf al-Din. He was born in about 628/1230-31 and is
known to have exercised under the Mamluk régime the office
of Superintendent of the Two Harams, that is, of Jerusalem and
Hebron (al-Khalil). He was appointed in Rajab 694/May-June
1295. Other brief fragments of information suggest that he was
a scholar of Prophetic Tradition (Hadith).

There is general agreement that he died in Jerusalem in
the month of Dhw’l-Hijja 698. We can ignore the year 678 given
 DY GUE SOUICE VWI WOUIG SiVe UIC Cate Api L20U), do Ulls
would be before the date of the endowment for his foundation.
The precise date is either the eve of Tuesday the 4th of the
month/1 September 1299 or of Tuesday 24/22 September.
Attended by a large crowd out of respect for his position and his
religious worthiness he was buried in what Mujir al-Din calls,
with typical vagueness of terminology, ‘his ribat, known as the
Awhadiyya Madrasa’, having previously referred to it as a turba
(see above).

ENDOWMENT
The only information is in an entry in an Ottoman land
register,’ which reads as follows:

Wagfiyya of al-Malik al-Awhad b. Ayyab for his Mausoleum
in Bab Hitta. The copy of the instrument of endowment is
dated 697.

[i] The house, in which the mausoleum is located, for the
residence of the caretaker (al-gayyim) and lodging for his
sons (?) and his freedmen who visit the mausoleum: yearly
... [blank].

[ii] Storerooms (?) in the Monastery Gate (?) Hill in the Bab
Hitta district: yearly 100 [aspers]

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

That the building was to serve as the burial place for the
founder is beyond doubt. In 780/1379 the Shaykh Burhan al-
Din Ibrahim al-Nasiri was established as one of the Koran
readers in the Awhadiyya Mausoleum with a stipend fixed by
the terms of the endowment, to replace someone deemed
unsuitable.® The figure 5 [dirhams ?] is written on the
appointment — the monthly stipend, presumably.

One of the Haram documents takes note of a man, bearing
the visba al-Misri (the Egyptian), mortally ill ‘in his residence in
the tabaqa of the Awhadiyya waqf in the Bab Hitta quarter.” Can
this be an indication of the ribat role suggested by the Defter
entry given above? A summary description of the Awhadiyya in
an eighteenth-century sijill mentions two floors, the upper
containing two tabagas (apartments?). The lower floor has the
larger rooms, including ‘a large chamber containing a mibrab,
in which is the tomb of al-Malik al-Awhad’. This same sijill
records the permission granted to the combined mutawallt-
nazir-shaykh of the ‘madrasa’ to carry out repairs to the
building which was ina ruinous state.'° Whether it actually ever
 functioned as a fully-fledged madrasa is open to question. Asali
give the names of three persons who held the mashyakha (post
of shaykh) in the eighteenth century. '! At the present time the
building is given over to private dwellings.
 "
9,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","HARAM FRONTAGE (see fig. 1.1)

The Haram frontage, under the portico and now hidden behind
the blocked-up arcade of the north portico, is quite plain. A
solitary grilled window in the Haram wall, which, as al-Umari
observed, once opened to the tomb chamber, is now blocked.
The dome over the tomb chamber rises above the roof of the
portico but is set so far back as to have been visible only from
afar. Later Ottoman apartments ranged in front of the dome
now obscure it from view.

STREET FACADE (fig. 9.6)

This facade, extending from the tomb chamber across the
width of the eastern courtyard to the entrance portal, was
clearly intended as the principal facade. It contains two
handsome windows both of which are now blocked, The
facade is crowned by a cornice moulding which rises above the
entrance portal in the beginnings of a pish-taq. The upper part
of the pish-taq has been dismantled and an Ottoman
construction now sits over the doorway. The northern extent of
the facade can be determined from the definite termination of
the cornice. To the north the disposition of the masonry (see
Jig. 9.6) shows that the adjoining wall stood toa height of 4.30m
before the Awhadiyya was built. There are several stones
 bearing Crusader masons’ marks in that adjoining wall but
since they are obviously in secondary use the wall must be later,
probably Ayyubid.

An even earlier building seems once to have occupied part
of the site, for remains of a single course of stones project into
the street following a different alignment from the present
buildings. The southernmost vestige of this course of stones
was until 1981 used as a step at the main entrance to the
Awhadiyya.”?

At the southern end of the street the window of the tomb
chamber is in an infill wall built into the western arch of the
earlier northern porch of Bab Hitta where passers-by entering
and leaving the Haram could look in at the grave of the founder.
The window in the middle of the facade opens, most unusually,
to the eastern courtyard. It is hard to imagine what purpose this
window might have served. Since the courtyard is open to the
sky, it was not needed for lighting. It cannot have been
introduced simply to enliven an otherwise blank stretch of
masonry because Mamluk masons were not afraid to leave
large expanses of wall undecorated. The most likely purpose of
the window, which is almost identical in form with that of the
tomb chamber, was to be a visual reminder to passers-by of the
association of the main complex with the tomb of the founder,
of which the window, beneath the earlier gate porch, might
otherwise have appeared separated from the rest of the facade
including the entrance portal.

Both windows are similarly set in shallow recesses with
pointed arches resting on re-used marble imposts of Crusader
workmanship (see fig. 10c). The jambs, lintels and sills are
solid blocks of veined white marble. (A row of stone corbels
 beside the left-hand impost of the courtyard window (see fig.
9.6) is a later insertion. )

Above the lintel of the courtyard window there is a
rectangular stone panel carved in light relief. The main features
of the carved design (plate 9.1) are two decorative medallions
interconnected by a circular link. The scheme of the right-hand
medallion consists of a ten-pointed star interwoven with a
curvilinear ten-pointed blunt star round a central rosette
composed of four heart-shaped leaves. The scheme of the left-
hand medallion consists of two overlapping and interlocking
rectilinear nine-pointed stars round a curious ‘flying bird’ motif
(see below). The background of the panel is filled with an
intricate arabesque of foliate scrolls and palmettes.
 ENTRANCE (plate 9.2)

The entrance doorway is set at the back of a deep recess flanked
by the customary stone benches. Crusader marble columns are
re-used for nook-shafts to articulate the outer corners of the
entrance bay. The bay is roofed by a cloister vault (plate 9.3).
The peripheral stones of the vault form in the vertical plane the
alternately split voussoirs of the frontal arch. The voussoirs are
bisected in such a way that each stone weighs about as much as
its neighbour, i.e. the split voussoirs, half as thick as the whole
ones, penetrate twice as far back into the vault (plate 9.3). The
vault springs from a re-used marble impost with the same
profile as the impost of the courtyard window (fig. 10c),and the
stonework radiates from a central hub; the radial joints are
chamfered for emphasis. That central hub (plate 9.4) is inlaid
with black bituminous limestone to form an unusual blazon-
like device (see below). Larger versions of the same design are
inlaid in the side walls of the recess alongside the capitals of the

corner columns where they would be easily seen from the
street.
 THE ‘BLAZONS’ (fig. 9.8)

Each of these devices consists of an ornamental circular shield.
The sides of the shield develop inwards to form demi-
palmettes while a central stem rises behind a crescent and then
swells into a curious bulbous element, the upper tip of which
 breaks through the shield. At the base the stem breaks through
the shield to form a swag.

This device represents an interesting development in the
use of heraldic motifs. It appears to belong to a series of
insecurely dated devices based on the heraldic fleur-de-lis. The
first of these (fig. 9.9) consists of fleurs-de-lis alternating with
eight-petalled rosettes on mugarnas capitals re-used as
column bases in the minbar (rebuilt in 1375/1955-56) of the
 Great Mosque of Homs built by Nur al-Din Zangi (reigned 541/
1146-569/1174). L.A. Mayer in his great corpus of Saracenic
heraldry"" ascribes this capital to Nir al-Din but M. Meinecke
has recently suggested"" that it ought to be dated later, probably
after 671/1272-73. Meinecke’s dating seems more likely but
since the fleur-de-lis, occasionally in conjunction with other
royal, heraldic or pseudo-heraldic emblems, remained in use
well into the eight/fourteenth century” it is impossible to date
 this example with any precision. The second is a fleur-de-lis in
a circular shield carved in stucco (fig. 9.10) in the Maristan of
Nar al-Din in Damascus (built 549/1154). It was also dated by
Mayer to the time of Nur al-Din but is now more securely dated
by Meinecke™ to Sultan Qalawiin’s restorations there in 682/
1283. This fleur-de-lis has a swag base similar to that of the
Awhadiyya ‘blazons’ but is contained within the circular shield.
The third is a fleur-de-lis in a circular shield flanked by two
affronted feline animals in circular shields (fig. 9.11) on an
unidentified building at al-Salahiyya near Damascus.’’ Here the
fleur-de-lis has a cup-like base and there are demi-palmettes
sprouting from the circumference of the encircling shield in a
manner analogous to the Awhadiyya ‘blazons’. The Awhadiyya
blazons seem to display a development of this form whereby
the two outer leaves of the emblem are adjoined as demi-
palmettes to the circumference of the shield leaving only an
elaborated central leaf with a swag base and a crescent around
the stem. The crescent is not an uncommon element in Mamltk
art'® and is often used in conjunction with other devices.’ It
appears here to be an adaptation of the more usual cross-bar
found in fleurs-de-lis, designed to fill the space in the lower
part ofthe shield. A later stage in this evolution is to be foundalso
in Jerusalem at the Jaliqiyya Turba (no. 11) where the ‘fleur-de-
lis’ in a foundation inscription dated 707/1307 still has the swag
base but has developed no less than eleven leaves (fig. 9.12).

Thus it would appear that these ‘blazons’ at the Awhadiyya
were most likely inspired by heraldic emblems but that the
designer was perhaps making use of the technical heraldic
vocabulary of his day for symbolic or ornamental, not heraldic
purposes.

THE FLYING BIRD’ (fig. 9.13)

This may be a similar sort of hybrid. It is the only known
example of representational carving from the Mamluk period
in Jerusalem.”! The body of the bird follows a formalized type
commonly given to standing eagles in Mamlik heraldry and
decoration. The eight-petalled rosette in the middle of the
composition may have some heraldic association though this is
not certain.” Eagles with one or two heads in combination with
another heraldic emblem are found in Mamlik heraldry from
the end of the seven/thirteenth century,” but never is one
emblem charged with the other. Even more unusual is the
horizontal posture of the bird —as if it were in flight —and its
curiously naturalistic head surrounded by a halo.”4 The small
 aprane Soierentin Sa oe Tae eA Eiicn nating Ta eel a Sa ash Cc ateet ak pear mE os LN eA gts WP 4 /ie a

size of this motif (0.12m diameter) and its sketchy carving make
it scarcely noticeable in a large panel of elaborately carved
decoration. This seems to indicate that it was not intended to be
read as a blazon; if it were, the presence of the blazon-like
shields at the entrance portal would be utterly confusing.

INTERIOR
@ Ground floor (plan, fig. 9.3; axonometric, fig. 9.7)
The entrance doorway leads into a cross-vaulted vestibule,
almost square in plan. A wide stone bench against the back
(west) wall narrows in returning along the north wall. The
entrance into the courtyard is in the south wall of the vestibule,
so that there is no clear view of the interior here from the street.
The four walls of the eastern courtyard (plate 9.14) are
crowned at a uniform height by a continuous cornice
moulding. Only along the south side, the north wall of the tomb
chamber and of an upper room adjoining it are built above the
moulding (plate 9.5, fig. 9.7).
Underneath a remarkable porch incorporating two fe-
 atts Setter teary th Wort tenats od i rm brant SA fot

used Crusader columns (plate 9.6) in the south-west corner of
the courtyard three steps lead up to the doorway of the
antechamber to the tomb chamber. The tomb chamber was
originally entered by passing under a transverse arch spanning
between two more re-used Crusader columns (plate 9.7). A
modern partition wall has been erected to seal off the tomb
chamber which is now quite inaccessible. Only by peering in
through a narrow, splayed window high in its north wall
 (visible in plate 9.5) can a view of the darkened chamber be
obtained. Through the same window a camera and flashlight
can be introduced and photographs give a reasonably clear
impression of the interior (plates 9.8 and 9.9).

The lower walls of the tomb chamber are plastered,
Pointed wall arches and ashlar pendentives support a smooth
ashlar drum and dome. The curve of the pendentives begins in
the voussoirs of the four supporting arches, giving each
voussoir a compound curve on its face. No two voussoirs of any
one arch are the same. This distinctive form of pendentive
construction, otherwise unknown in the Islamic architecture of
Jerusalem, is usual in Crusader domes in Jerusalem, from
which the builders seem most likely to have drawn their
inspiration. Here, however, the pendentives, rather than
terminating at the level of the apexes of the keystones of the
supporting arches as is usual in Crusader domes, terminate at
the level of the base of the keystones. From this level upwards
the cylindrical shape of the lower part of the drum, or ‘sub-
drum’, is already defined (plate 9.9). Besides cutting across the
keystones, this sub-drum also cuts across the uppermost
voussoirs of the arches, which are accordingly cut into
extraordinary shapes, the faces of each voussoir defining two
different intersecting curved planes. The whole zone of
transition gives an impression, false of course, of having been
somehow hewn from a solid mass of masonry. As in Crusader
domes, a cavetto moulding above the sub-drum marks the base
of the drum proper. The drum is decorated with twelve slightly
pointed arches; the four over the pendentives are windows
(now blocked) and the others are shallow, concave, blind
niches. Another cavetto moulding separates the drum from the
ashlar dome.

A deep recess in the south (Haram) wall of the tomb
chamber opens under a semicircular arch with distinctive 45°
chamfering of the lower edge of the voussoirs similar to that
found on several Haram gates, including the adjoining Bab
Hitta which we consider to be Umayyad. This raises the
possibility that the present Bab Hitta is but one bay of a double
gateway of which this recess was the western bay. A vertical
joint in the masonry of the Haram wall (marked ‘j’ on the plan,

fig. 9.3) about 1.20m west of the opening of the Bab Hitta
strengthens this possibility (although there is no joint visible at
the point corresponding to the west jamb of this possible
gateway).

A wooden screen with remains of a quirked ogee cresting
(plate 9.8), perhaps original, closes most of the lower part of
the recess. Of the mibrab mentioned in the eighteenth-century
docket referred to above (p. 167) the only possible trace is a
crack in the plaster on the south wall of the recess beside the
window (now blocked) that once opened under the Haram
portico.

At the north-west corner of the eastern courtyard a
corridor connects with the courtyard of an earlier adjoining
house to the north (plate 9.10). Two doors, one on either side,
Open into rooms off the corridor. The small room on the east
side occupies the space between the corridor and the entrance
vestibule. One tier of mugarnas corbelling (plate 9.11)
remains of a transition zone that must originally have
supported a dome over the southern part of this room, which
now houses a latrine. Pieces of similar muqarnas, apparently
from an upper tier of that corbelling, are to be found in the
adjoining building to the north where they have been crudely
incorporated into a later wall (plate 9.12).

On the west side of the corridor four steps rise to the door
of a large cross-vaulted room which forms the north boundary
of the western courtyard. The conjunction between the south-
east corner of this room and the wall separating the courtyards
shows that the room existed before the Awhadiyya was built. A
thick coat of plaster conceals the masonry walls of the interior
and so there is no sign here of the blocked doorway previously
observed in the adjoining room to the north (part of the
northern annexes of the Dawadariyya, see above, p. 164). In the
south wall of the room there are two windows (the eastern one
 recently enlarged) with a narrow slit window between them.
Under the western window a door and five roughly made steps
lead down to the western courtyard.
 The original beautifully laid paving, which survives almost
intact in the eastern courtyard, extends into the western
courtyard where it is less well preserved. Enough of it remains
to confirm that both courtyards retain their original form. The
western courtyard has no cornice moulding around its walls. Its
east boundary is the wall separating it from the eastern
courtyard. Its west boundary is formed by the east wall of the
earlier Dawadariyya (no. 8) and its north boundary is formed
by the pre-existing room described above. On the south side of
the courtyard a large vaulted chamber, part of the original
construction, is now divided by a thin partition wall (see plan,

fig. 9.3). This chamber was entered by a door in the south-west
corner of the courtyard; a second door to the east of it is a later
insertion. Originally the chamber was lit and ventilated by a
small window above the former door; there were no openings
in the south (Haram) wall.

Mujir al-Din calls the building a ribat, known as a
madrasa, yet listed in his catalogue of monuments as a terba
(above, p. 167). So it would appear that the tomb (turba) was
combined with either a ribat or a madrasa, both of which need
to provide accommodation: the ribat for pilgrims, the madrasa
for students. This would explain the purpose of the second
courtyard. The main funerary complex occupies the eastern
courtyard, while the western courtyard with its adjoining
rooms must have lodged pilgrims or students.
 A rectangular sump in the bottom step at the entrance to
the tomb antechamber has a shallow basin decorated with an
eight-petalled rosette around a central sink hole that
presumably fed water to a cistern below. Various shallow
runnels cut in the paving of the eastern courtyard appear to
have been intended to direct rainwater towards this or another
sink (which no longer survives). A recess under the stairway in
the western courtyard houses a well-head where water could
be drawn from the cistern.

(ii) Upper levels (figs.9.4and 9.5)

The stairway against the east wall of the western courtyard rises
to a landing that originally gave access to the roof of the room
on the south side of the western courtyard. The present cross-
vaulted room built on that roof (see mezzanine plan, fig. 9.4) is
not original; its north-facing double window surmounted by an
ogee-headed slit (plate 9.13) is typically Ottoman. On the east
side of the landing there is a deep recess, possibly originally a
window lighting the tomb antechamber to the east. The
masonry around the recess contains several re-used stones
with distinctive Crusader diagonal tooling and masons’ marks.

The stairs continue upwards from the landing to the roof
of the Haram portico, where a shallow 7wan, facing south, leads
into an upper room built beside the dome of the tomb
chamber. At first glance this room, which encroaches upon the
  courtyards (but not the Siifis in the courtyard of the adjoining
Dawadariyya Khanqah) and also to take advantage of the
impressive view over the Haram to the south. That being so, the
builders were faced with the problem of how to suppott its east
wall. Either they could build it on top of the structurally weak
clear span of the tomb antechamber’s vault or, as they did, place
it as far as possible to the east where it sits securely over the
more robust structure of the arch between the antechamber
and the tomb, even though this entailed removing part of the
drum’s cornice. Thus the room must have been built after the
 dome had been completed. But it was not an afterthought, for
the four windows (now blocked) in the drum supporting the
dome are placed on the diagonal axes, not on the cardinal axes
as one would expect, so as to allow for the adjoining
construction of the upper floor room.

The base of the minaret is built into the north-west corner of
the Haram, its lower north and west sides abutting against the
natural rock where it has been quarried away to form the
corner (see below). Mujir al-Din remarks that this minaret,
like others around the Haram, appears to have been built on
the foundations of an earlier minaret that existed at the
time of ‘Abd al-Malik (65-86/685-705).1 There is now no visible
trace of an earlier minaret.

The present minaret, built entirely of stone except for a
timber canopy over the muezzin’s gallery, is of the traditional
Syrian tower type, square in plan.” Externally it is divided by
mouldings into several ‘storeys’. The two lowest storeys form a
base on which the upper storeys are set back to leave a
corbelled gallery above the base. At the sixth storey a bigger set-
back gives a muezzin’s gallery, which is partly supported on
mugarnas corbelling. This gallery has a modern balustrade
and canopy. Above that is a lantern, octagonal in plan,
surmounted by a circular drum and bulbous dome.

An external staircase rises to a door in the east face of the
second storey. This door leads to a passage along the north side
of the minaret, from where another door opens to an internal
spiral staircase up to the muezzin’s gallery.
 IDENTIFICATION
Al-‘Umari, writing c.745/1345, describes at the end of the north
wall of the Haram:

... avery long staircase, which is new and from the top of
which a minaret is reached as well as a house there
belonging to the Bani Jama‘a. This minaret is at the farthest
point of the west wall of the Haram. It is 53 dhira’
(approximately 37.1m) high. At its top are carved wooden
railings. It is decorated with thirty-one fine marble
columns.’

By Mujir al-Din’s time it had become known as the Ghawanima
Minaret ‘because it is next to Bab al-Ghawanima.” That gate was
so called after the Ghanim family, descendants of Shaykh
Ghanim b. ‘Ali b. Husayn, who was appointed shaykh of the
Salahiyya Madrasa by Saladin.>

DATE
Mujir al-Din relates that two porticoes (no longer extant)
below the Governor’s House (the former Jawiliyya, no. 14)
 were constructed at the same time as the Ghawanima Minaret.
These porticoes bore an inscription giving the date of their
construction and that of the minaret, but over the years it had
become badly eroded (making it illegible).° He goes on to
observe that this minaret, the largest and most solid one, was
built by Qadi Sharaf al-Din ‘Abd al-Rahman, superintendent of
pious endowments in the Harams of Mecca and Medina and
also the Harams of Jerusalem and Hebron. Mujir al-Din saw a
document confirming this qadi’s reappointment to these posts
by Sultan Lajin. This document was dated 23 Jumada II 697/8
April 1298 and, he continues, the construction of the minaret
may be attributed to that time.’ He adds that he had been told
that the minaret was built in the reign of the descendants of
Qalawin and that that too is possible. In any case, a date of
construction around 697/1298 accords well enough with the
architecture.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

An inscription over the entrance door records that the minaret
was repaired by the Supreme Muslim Council in 1341/1922-23.
These repairs appear to have been of a minor nature, involving
mainly the replacement of the balustrade and canopy of the
muezzin’s gallery.
 "
10,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","EXTERIOR (fig. 10.5; plate 10.1)

This minaret is one of the most virile pieces of architecture in
Jerusalem. The manifest sturdiness of its construction has
withstood several earthquakes with little trace of damage. Yet
the variety and design of its decoration — notably the muqarnas
corbelling supporting the galleries and the marble nook-shafts
in the outer corners of the fourth and fifth storeys — lend it a
certain elegance that belies its enormous solidity.

Of the two base storeys, only the east and south faces are
visible; the north and west faces abut directly against the
scarped rock in the corner of the Haram. All four sides of the
upper storeys are exposed. Each storey is distinguished from
the others by its architectural details, which are repeated on all
four sides. Sockets about 0.20m square at various levels in the
sides of the minaret appear to be putlog holes that would have
held scaffolding in place during construction.

The two base storeys are reinforced by corner buttresses
(plate 10.2). In the lowest storey, recesses in the exposed south
 and east sides between these buttresses have sloping sills and
cavetto heads decorated with a repeated mugarnas motif. The
second storey, which steps back slightly, has in each exposed
side a blind double arch composed of gadrooned voussoirs
supported by three re-used Crusader columns complete with
capitals and bases. The round horseshoe profile of the arches is
noteworthy, suggestive perhaps of Andalusian influence (see
above, p. 91). Above the keystones of each arch and in the
common spandrel between these three columns, column
drums have been set into the masonry in order to strengthen
the masonry bond. A further column drum is set at the same
level into the two south-facing corner buttresses. One course
higher, a slightly recessed panel, framed by bands of red stone
above and below, seems to have been intended for an
inscription which was never carved. Above that, three tiers of
bold muqarnas corbelling support a parapet wall around the
lower gallery.

The third storey, set back from the base to allow for the
gallery, has a shallow cavetto-headed recess in each side. Little
paired round-headed windows with bevelled jambs open in
these recesses. Those in the north and east sides are blind.
Dividing the third storey from the fourth is a projecting string
course with a sloping top surface. This string course is
decorated in an unusual manner with a regular series of small,
arched niches.

The fourth storey has re-used Crusader columns with
capitals and bases set in nooks in all four corners. In the middle
of each side is a shallow recess spanned by two pointed arches
supported by a central corbel. The recesses in the east, north
and west sides each enclose a smaller, bevel-edged square
recess containing an octagonal window, blind in the east and
north sides. The south recess contains a square window. A
recessed rectangular panel enclosing the paired arches of each
recess is pierced by a small diamond-shaped window. Dividing
this storey from the fifth is a projecting string course decorated
with a cavetto moulding with repeated muqarnas elements
carved into it and pendent mzqarnas ‘stalactites’ at the corners.

The fifth storey also has re-used Crusader columns for
nook-shafts in the corners. In the middle of each side a recess
containing a rectangular window is spanned by paired pointed-
arches supported by a central column, also of Crusader
manufacture and complete with capitals and bases. Above this
storey two tiers of vigorous muqarnas corbelling support the
muezzin’s gallery around the sixth storey.

In each side of the sixth storey are further double-arched
recesses, all containing two rectangular windows except for the
one in the south side which contains a door to the staircase. The
arches are supported by further re-used Crusader columns,
three of which carry remarkable historiated capitals, also
Crusader. The balustrade and canopy of the gallery were
replaced during the 1341/1922-23 repairs.

The octagonal lantern has pointed-arched recesses in each
side, all containing slit windows save the east one which has a
door evidently intended to allow access to the roof of the
 canopy. A continuous hoodmould frames the extrados of the
arches. This storey is crowned by a simple splayface moulding,
above which is the drum, pierced by windows on the cardinal
axes. Each of these windows is square on the exterior but
pointed inside. The bulbous dome, separated from the drum
by a splayface moulding, was refurbished during the 1922-23
repairs. It is surmounted by a bronze crescent finial.

INTERIOR

The entrance to the minaret is reached by a long open stair that
rises northwards against a plain building that projects into the
Haram from the north rock scarp (fig. 10.3). The scarp at this
point is cut back to form a re-entrant angle. The staircase (plate
10.3) follows the line of the scarp, turning westwards along it to
rise to a rectangular door in the east face of the second storey
of the minaret.” Above this door is the inscription recording the
1922-23 repairs. The door leads to a vaulted passage along the
north side of the minaret. At its west end it opens on the roofs
of adjoining buildings to the west. In its south side a door leads
 into the spiral staircase to the muezzin’s gallery. This staircase
is roofed by a continuous rising barrel vault and is lit by the
various windows described above. It gives access first of all to
the lower gallery by a door opening east. The lower gallery
extends only along the east and south sides. It could well have
been used by muezzins as an alternative to the higher gallery,
At the level of the higher gallery the staircase stops at a door
opening south to the gallery.'° Here the newel is carried up
above the last step in the form of a re-used column, and is
crowned by an interesting capital decorated with muqarnas
niches (plate 10.4). A hole in the ceiling of this area will have
allowed access to the interior of the lantern. Through this hole
the unusual construction of the transition zone under the
circular drum and dome may be observed (plate 10.5). It
consists of intersecting arches of a type more commonly
associated with the architecture of Andalusia or Armenia, and it
is conceivable that the craftsmen responsible for it came from
one of these regions (see above, p. 91).
 Notes

1 Mujir, 379. Ibn ‘Abd Rabbihi (wrote c.300/913) enumerated four minarets in
the Haram (G. Le Strange, Palestine under the Moslems, London, 1890, 163) which
may have existed still in the Crusader period, for William of Tyre saw tall towers
(turres sublimes) from which muezzins formerly made the call to prayer (RHCOc,
i, chap. iii). Clermont-Ganneau (Archaeological Researches in Palestine during
the years 1873-1874, London, 1899, 145) has suggested that these early minarets
correspond to ‘certain strategic fortified points in the ancient enclosing wall of the
Temple’.

To the east of the present Ghawanima Minaret an opening in the north rock
scarp about 3.5m above the ground (see plate 10.6) leads into a small cave, which
has a square hole in its floor to give access to a cylindrical cistern that probably
belongs to some earlier development of the site.

 "
11,"Il SITE AND BUILDINGS (fig. 11.2)
","The Jaliqiyya comprises two units: a domed chamber at the
street corner and an antechamber to the north, along Daraj al-
‘Ayn. The original entrance (now blocked) was through the
antechamber by a door opening from Daraj al-‘Ayn. To the west
of the antechamber is a small courtyard enclosed by later
buildings, all apparently dating from the Ottoman period.

The Jaliqiyya can be seen to rest on earlier foundations of
a type visible on both sides of Daraj al-‘Ayn, which themselves
overlie one of the vaulted bays of a more ancient bridge
carrying Tariq Bab al-Silsila from west to east across the town’s
central (Tyropoeon) valley to the Haram Gate of the Chain. The
vaults under the Jaliqiyya were cleared of debris in 1977 to form
a passage from Tariq al-Wad to the new Wailing Wall plaza
(plate 11.12). The only archaeological inspection of the area
was made in 1931 when evidence for an early Islamic
(Umayyad) date of construction was associated with the main
vault and its abutments.’ Various later extensions have been
added to the north and south ends of the main vault, primarily
during the Crusader period as the frequent occurrence of
masons’ marks in the structure demonstrates, though some
parts may be later. A full survey of these vaults, which would
surely help to clarify the pre-Mamlik development of the city,
remains to be made.
 "
11,"Il HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION
The following funerary inscription survives on the south wall of
the building (fig. 11.5):

In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate. This
is the mausoleum of the most noble, grand amir, the
warrior, the fighter for the faith, the soldier on the path of
God Almighty, Rukn al-Din Baybars al-Jaliq al-Salihi. He
died [and passed] to the mercy of God Almighty on the
tenth of Jumada I in the year 707 [4 November 1307]. May
God have mercy upon hie and upon those who pray that
he may be shown mercy.”

Mujir al-Din sites the Jaligiyya Mausoleum ‘at the top of the
Aqueduct Steps Geary) al-‘Ayn) on [the street of] the Chain Gate
(Bab al-Silsila).? The steps are those that connect with the
Valley Street (Tariq al-Wad) at the lower level.
 DATE

No date for the construction of the mausoleum is given in any
source, nor is the date of the endowment anywhere alluded to.
Since the founder’s body was carried to Jerusalem and buried
in the turba he had raised for himself, it must have been
completed before Jumada I 707/November 1307.

FOUNDER

Baybars al-Jaliq* was one of the mamluks of the Ayyubid Sultan,
al-Salih Najm al-Din Ayyab, belonging to the corps of the
jamdariyya (the men of the Wardrobe). He thus belonged to
the celebrated group known as the Salihiyya (hence the isba
in the inscription given above). It was the Sultan Baybars who
raised him to the rank of amir,’ the last member of the
Salihiyya, it is said, to gain that promotion. After a steady rise to
high rank, Baybars sent him to Damascus with a magnificent
igta’. In 678/1279 he was commander of a force stationed at
Aleppo and returned to Damascus to help arrest Azdamur al-
Zahiri when the latter had abandoned al-Sa‘id, son of Baybars.®
Later, along with Lajin, the future Sultan, he travelled by the
post horses to Damascus in two days and seven ‘hours to
administer the oath to the troops there upon the succession of
Qalawiin.’ When the governor, Sunqur al-Ashqar, took steps to
declare himself sultan with the title al-Kamil, both Baybars al-
Jaliq and Lajin refused to swear allegiance and were
imprisoned in the citadel at Damascus (23 Dhi’l-Hijja 678/25
April 1280). Within a few months, after Sunqur had been
defeated, they were released.®

Baybars al-Jaliq fought at the battle of Homs against the
Mongols (Thursday, 14 Rajab 680/30 October 1281)’ and was
one of the defeated right wing of the Mamlak army.'? When
Lajin made his own bid for the sultanate in 696/1297, Baybars al-
Jaliq did not support Kitbugha, although his name is not
mentioned among those who gave positive aid to Lajin.""' In the
following year he took part in a major raid on the territory of
Lesser Armenia (697/1298).

According to the funerary inscription he died on 10th
Jumada I 707/4 November 1307. All sources agree on the month
and the year, but the 15th and the 19th’ are also put forward for
the day. The inscription obviously carries greater weight. As for
the place where he died, ‘He died... outside Ramla and was
carried to Jerusalem, where he was buried in accordance with
 his last will and testament.’ Thus Ibn al-Dawadari,'‘ and in the
words of Ibn Kathir, ‘He was the last of the Bahriyya to die. He
went from Damascus to Ramla on business connected with his
igtd’, and there died in the year 707, having lived a long life. His
corpse was taken to Jerusalem.”” Ibn Hajar says that he died
‘outside Jerusalem’.’° All the sources stress his many acts of
charity and Maqrizi adds that he used to lend money to soldiers
who were preparing for campaigns on the understanding that
they would repay him when their circumstances were easier,
and that he lost much money in that way. Nevertheless, he left
great wealth to his heirs.’7
 SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

There is remarkably little reference to this building. It is always
referred to as a turba. This may mean that there was no other
teaching or wider devotional activity, other than the endowed
prayers and readings one may assume to have existed, although
there is no mention of them either.

There is, we believe, no reference to the Jaliqiyya in the
Haram documents and we were only able to find one
document in the Jerusalem Sijills we examined. That is a lease
agreement for a shop,”® part of the waqf of the Jaligiyya (and the
word turba is left out in the sijill), situated in David Street. The
lease was for one year at a rent of 72 paras.
 "
11,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","SOUTH FACADE (fig. 11.4)

Facing Tariq Bab al-Silsila, this, the main facade, is decorated
sparsely: an iron-grilled window opening into the tomb
chamber is surmounted by a funerary inscription (above, p.
184) over its monolithic lintel and, above that, a small high-
level window lighting the tomb chamber and a cavetto
moulding running across the facade (plate 11.1). The adjoining
structures to east and west appear to be later (see below); the
buildings on the upper floor are obviously Ottoman.

The eastern limit of the facade is quite clear since it forms
the corner where the two streets meet. Here a later arch,
opening into the street leading down to Tarig al-Wad, has been
keyed into the original masonry of the facade. In the left-hand
spandrel of the arch, under a cyma moulding that runs
eastwards away from the Jaligiyya (fig. 11.4), an inscription has
been inserted into the masonry of the Jaliqiyya facade. It
commemorates the completion, in 874/1469 during the reign
of Sultan Qaytbay, of the restoration of the aqueducts supplying
water to the Haram,” which meet under the street near this
point.
 The western limit of the facade is not readily identifiable
because the later stonework of the adjoining building has been
dovetailed into the stonework of the tomb to form a ragged
junction (see fig. 11.4). The only continuous vertical joint,
which probably marks the western limit of the original
structure, is in the two lowest courses 3.22m to the left of the
centre-line of the grilled window. The eastern corner of the
facade is 3.48m to the right of that centre-line, making the
original facade not quite symmetrical about the window but
nearly so. Of course, some earlier structure now replaced by
the present building to the west of the Jaligiyya may once have
occupied that adjoining site, and any near symmetry detectable
in plan need not have been evident on the facade.

Above a level coinciding with the top of the inscription, all
the masonry appears to belong to some later rebuilding of the
upper facade, presumably done when the adjoining upper
storeys were added. The cavetto moulding, four courses above
the inscription, belongs to that later rebuilding; it may,
however, be in re-use in its present position and we cannot rule
out the possibility that this moulding once formed a cornice on
the south and east facades.

The dome rises above the facade but is now concealed by
a later parapet wall (plate 11.2). It seems, however, never to
have been as prominent a feature as the domes of other tombs,
for it has no drum.
 EAST FRONTAGE (fig. 11.6)

The street corner forms the southern limit of the east frontage.
The northern limit coincides with a distinct break in the
masonry about 9.40m from the corner. The lowest masonry
courses (owing to the slope of the street, that is the first course
above street level at the south end up to the third above street
level at the north end) are built of large stones, many of which
are very roughly dressed (plate 1 1.3). These stones may belong
to the earlier structure, mentioned above, that once occupied
the site. Three courses of smaller masonry have been laid on
top of the roughly dressed lowest courses to form a level
surface on which the east wall of the tomb was constructed in
masonry similar to that of the south facade. The uppermost
courses are concealed by a later vault spanning the street; this
yault is obviously contemporaneous with the arch at its south
end, described above.

An iron-grilled window, similar in size to the one in the
south facade, opens into the tomb chamber. North of that
window is the original entrance, now blocked save for a small
grilled window. At some time, perhaps during an earthquake,
this corner of the building was damaged: the door lintel is
cracked and is now supported by the blocking masonry, and
the stonework of the upper north end of the wall has been
crudely rebuilt in uncoursed rubble. The adjoining structure to
the north appears to be later.
 INTERIOR (plan, fig. 11.3; sections, figs. 11.7 and 11.8)

() Antechamber

The entrance door in the east wall opened into the
antechamber with a door in its south wall into the tomb
chamber. The antechamber has undergone various alterations.
 The present cross vault is not original, and a modern concrete-
block partition encloses an area in front of the door into the
tomb chamber. Two bare springers, one in the north wall and
One opposite it at the same level in the south wall, are shaped
in a way that indicates that originally a transverse arch divided
a barrel vault roofing the eastern part of the chamber from a
cross vault over the western part. A similar springer in the
south-west corner of the chamber suggests that it was open to
the west, like an zwan.
 A pointed-arched doorway (plate 11.4), typically Mamluk
in form, in the north wall of the antechamber leads into a cross-
vaulted room with a blocked opening in its east wall. This
room, to judge from the definite break in the masonry of the
east frontage (above), must belong to a later addition.

The buildings to the west of the antechamber and tomb
chamber are quite plain (apart from a re-used column with a
base for a capital) and appear mostly to be Ottoman (plate
11.5). It was in this area that a Dar al-Hadith was founded in 666/
1268” by Amir Sharaf al-Din Abi Muhammad ‘Isa but if it
survives there is nothing remarkable in the present
constructions on the site to allow its identification.

(ti) Tomb chamber

The floor of the tomb chamber is raised 0.50m above that of the
antechamber. A stone cenotaph, 1.70m long and 0.89m wide,
occupies the centre of the floor (plate 11.8). Presumably, it
marks the grave of the founder. A smaller cenotaph, 1.03m long
and 0.61m wide, rests against its north side, marking the grave
of some unknown person. The larger cenotaph has four
unusually well-preserved corner posts (plate 11.7) of reddish
limestone, all decorated in the same way with pointed-arched
niches cut in each of the shaft’s eight sides, on top of which sits
a bulbous knob lightly carved in the customary manner with
eight drooping petals.21 The smaller cenotaph has simpler

third similar one which has fallen to the floor and lost its knob,
and a fourth decorated differently from the others with
inverted mugarnas (plate 11.8), which is apparently not in its
proper place.

Wall arches support the dome. These arches open into
shallow recesses on the north and south sides (0.42m and
0.38m respectively) and a deeper (1.12m) recess on the east
side. On the west side (plate 11.6) there is no recess, but it
appears that the present west wall, built flush with the arch
surmounting it, is secondary and has been constructed about
0.90m nearer to the centre of the room than the original wall.
This can be inferred from details observed in the masonry of
the south facade and from some curious irregularities in the
springings of vaulting in the adjoining room to the west. If we
assume that the vertical straight joint near the western end of
the two lowest courses in the facade represents the outer face
of the original west wall of the tomb chamber, and if we assume
that the wall had the same thickness (0.70 — 0.72m) as the other
walls of the chamber, then the interior plan would have been
approximately symmetrical (as shown dotted fig. 11.3) with a
recess in the west wall corresponding to that in the east.

The fact that the tomb chamber is rectangular, requiring
adjustments to be made in order to provide a square base for
the dome, suggests that its plan was perhaps dictated by the
dimensions of a pre-existing building.

There are openings in the middle of all four walls: grilled
windows in the east and south walls opening on the streets, the
entrance door in the north wall, and a door (now blocked) in
the later west infill wall. Several stones with diagonal tooling
characteristic of Crusader workmanship have been re-used in
the jambs of the east window.

The finest feature of the tomb chamber is the internal
decoration of the zone of transition between the base and the
dome (figs. 11.7 and 11.8). This zone consists of three tiers of
mugqarnas which effect the transition by way of coffered
squinches in the corners (plate 11.9). Small pointed-arched
windows in the middle of each side at the same height as the
squinches (plate 11.10) illuminated the muqgarnas decoration,
making it readily visible from the street through the lower
windows; only the southern one now remains open. The dome
itself, roughly hemispherical, is built of rubble coated with
plaster (plate 11.11).

12,,"RAR FRIOLUIE

Al-‘Umari (c. 745/1345) described the west wall of the Haram
and its gates thus:

... From the end of the garden [in the Haram below where
the Manjakiyya (no. 35) was later built] to the farthest point
of the wall — which is the Ghawanima Minaret — is an open
space without porticoes. Abutting on this garden, to the
south is a large gate called Bab al-Ribat al-Mansiri [= Bab
al-Nazir] . . .’ In front of it is a walkway by which is reached
the flight of steps leading to the Dome of the Rock terrace
opposite Bab al-Hadid (to be mentioned presently). At the
side of the aforementioned gate, in a northerly direction,
is an arch [resting] on two piers .. . This arch is the first of
the arches at the west wall ... Next to the aforementioned
gate [is a portico]. It spans sixteen piers . . . A gate called
Bab al-Hadid comes next. In front of it is a paved walkway
by which a flight of steps leading to the Dome of the Rock
terrace is reached . . . Next to this gate is a portico with
eight piers. Next to this portico is a big gate, recently built
and newly opened, to which ten steps lead down, and on
either side of which are benches . . . It is well built... and
has arches ornamented on both sides with coloured stone
and a band of inscription in gold engraved on the stone. Its
doors are covered with filigree bronze and are well made
and decorated. From it the new market street [Staq al-
Qattanin, no. 24] is reached . . . To the [south] side of this
gate is a portico resting on two large piers . . . and at the
side of this portico is Bab al-Mutawadda’ [= Bab al-
Mathara] . . . Four steps lead from the ground level of the
Haram to Bab al-Mutawadda’ . . . Adjacent to the Bab al-
Mutawadda’ is a portico . . . spanning nine piers . . . at the
end of which, on the southern side is a mihrab abutting on
the minaret [of Bab al-Silsila, no. 20]. One prayer is said
there by a single imam. Next to it is the minaret belonging
to the Haram . .. Adjacent to the minaret are two doors; the
northern one is closed and nailed up; the minaret adjoins
it. The open door is called Bab al-Silsila. It was known of
old as Bab al-Sahara . . . In front of this gate is a walkway by
which a flight of steps to the Dome of the Rock terrace .. .
is reached . . . Next to the gate is a portico spanning ten
 piers .. . This portico has two windows to the Tankiziyya
Madrasa (no. 18), the shutters of both are of ebony and
ivory; inside is the madrasa. Above [the portico] is the
Tankiziyya Khanqah. At the end is a small door which gives
access to the roof of the madrasa and the lodgings of the
Siifis. At the end of the piers are six large granite columns.
Next to this portico, on the south, is a platform one dhira‘
(approx. 0.7m) high and thirty-eight less an eighth (26.5m)
in length from south to north . . . On measuring thirty-
three dbira’ from this platform you will find Bab Harat al-
Maghariba .. . Ata distance of three dhird (2.1m) from the
above-mentioned gate is a platform. It forms the end of the
west wall and the beginning of the south one. This
platform is adjacent to the Fakhriyya Zawiya (no. 22),
which is at the beginning of the south wall from the west.?

To al-‘Umari’s topographical description may be added Mujir
al-Din’s historical account:

On the west side of the Haram are porticoes, very solidly
built, extending from south to north. The first of them is
near the Haram gate known as Bab al-Maghiriba, and the
last is near the gate known as Bab al-Nazir and beyond it
towards Bab al-Ghawanima. These porticoes were all built
during the reign of the al-Malik al-Nasir Muhammad b.
Qalawin [but see below]. The portico extending from Bab
al-Maghariba to Bab al-Silsila was built in the year 713/
1313-14 [see below]. The portico that comes after the Bab
al-Silsila Minaret, extending to near Bab al-Nazir, was built
in the year 737/1336-37. The portico extending from Bab
al-Nazir to the vicinity of Bab al-Ghawanima was built in
the year 707/1307-8.°

Mujir al-Din’s chronology is based on three inscriptions
associated with these sections of portico. The first is on the pier
immediately south of Bab al-Nazir:

... This blessed portico was built in the reign of . . .al-Nasir
Muhammad b. Qalawin . . . during the superintendency
of... Bulghaq b. Jaghan al-Khwarizmi... and that [was
completed] in the year 707/1307-8.4
 The second inscription is built into the west wall of the Haram
about 5m south of Bab al-Silsila:

_.. This portico was built in the reign of... al-Nasir
Muhammad b. Qalawun.... during the superintendency of
the Amir Sharaf al-Din Musa b. Hasan al-Hadbani in the
year 713/1313-14

The third inscription is on the lintel of Bab al-Qattanin, dated
737/1336-37 (see below, p. 277). This gate forms part of the
portico adjoining it.

While Mujir al-Din’s chronology holds for the middle
section of the west portico, there are grounds for believing that
the constructional history of the portico is more complex, and
that the northern and southern extremities of the portico are
later additions. Each section of portico is discussed below.
 The individual sections of the west portico will be described
like the north portico, not in chronological order but in
topographical order, starting at the north end. In fig. 12.2 (see
fold-out at back of book) the piers supporting the arches of the
portico are numbered from 1 (north end) to 69 (south end),
the bays will be numbered in the same order so that pier 1 is the
pier immediately to the right (north) of bay 1.

BAYS 1-6

The first six bays of the portico appear to be structurally
homogeneous, notwithstanding certain variations in their
architectural treatment (see below, p. 384). These bays did not
exist when al-‘Umari described this part of the west wall and so
they must be dated after 745/1345; they must have been built
before c.762/1361 when the Manjakiyya (no. 35) was
constructed above them.

BAYS 7-10

The inscription dated 707/1307-8 is carved on pier 9. The two
bays to the north of that pier and the two to the south of it are
structurally and architecturally homogeneous and so can safely
be dated 707/1307-8.

BAYS 11-16

These appear to belong to the same phase of construction as
bays 7-10, for the impost moulding on pier 11 (which is the
southern pier of bay 10) is repeated on the other piers (12-17)
in this section. The cornice moulding above bays 11-16
extends also over bay 10; over bays 7-9 it was removed when
the Manjakiyya was built. This moulding continues half-way
over bay 17, implying that originally this section of portico
continued for at least one more bay to the south, as is suggested
also by the fact that the last pier in this section (pier 17) is
actually narrower than the others and so was not designed to
counteract any residual lateral thrust from the arches.
Presumably one or more bays of this portico were dismantled
eo hantheaadioinine cechion tothe south was aqgaea:
 BAYS 17-44

A continuous cornice extends over this section of portico from
the middle of bay 17 as far as bay 38, with upstands above piers
31 and 34 on either side of Bab al-Qattanin and a break above
piers 32 and 33, which form the lateral abutments of that gate.
The architectural integration of the portico with the gate shows
that they are contemporaneous. Bab al-Qattanin was
completed in 737/1336-37. Bays 23-29 around Bab al-Hadid
(bay 24) were demolished and rebuilt in 1928.° Bays 39-41
have been incorporated into the assembly hall of the Ashrafiyya
(no. 63) while bays 42-44 were demolished at the time of
construction of the Ashrafiyya in 887/1482 (see below, p. 593).
A vaulting springer survives in the vestibule of the Ashrafiyya as
evidence of the former presence there of bays 42 and 43, but of
bay 44 nothing whatsoever remains. This section of portico will
have abutted on the base of the Bab al-Silsila Minaret (no. 20)
to the south.

BAYS 45-55

These bays, including the inner porches of Bab al-Sakina (bay
45) and Bab al-Silsila (bay 46), show little sign of structural or
architectural uniformity; they appear to have been rebuilt,
perhaps more than once. Consequently it is impossible to say
exactly what part of this section of portico is referred to in the
inscription dated 713/1313-14, which is built into the Haram
wall at bay 49. The Tankiziyya (no. 18) was constructed partly
over this section of portico in 729/1328-29 and at that time some
reinforcing of the structure may well have been undertaken.
Buttressing of piers 47-52 in an effort to counteract any
tendency of the structure to fall over is plainly a later
modification made some time after the construction of the
Tankiziyya (see below, p 229). Pier 54 incorporates what seems
to be an earlier pier (plate 12.1) which, to judge from the
 tooling of the stone, is Crusader. What the purpose of that
earlier pier might have been is a mystery. Of the six granite
columns mentioned by al-‘Umari nothing remains.

BAYS 56-67
Apart from a change at bay 63 in the design of the water spouts

draining rainwater from the roof, this section of the portico is
structurally and architecturally homogeneous and appears to
belong toa single phase of construction. It must have been built
after 745/1345 for al-‘Umari makes no mention of it. It existed
in Mujir al-Din’s day (901/1496) and is shown in a panorama of
the Haram drawn in 1483 by Erhard Reuwich.

 BAYS 68-69

These two bays, completing the west portico, form a kind of
inner porch at Bab al-Maghariba. They are not mentioned byal-
‘Umari. The last pier (69) partly blocks the entrance to the
Fakhriyya (no. 22), which was founded before 732/1332. The
conjunction between bay 68 and the portico to the north seems
to indicate that the two bays are contemporaneous, and so bays
68 and 69 will also have been built before 1483. Early
photographs (see plate 22.4) show that a Porch of four bays
extended eastward from bay 69 in front of the north facade of
the Fakhriyya (see below, p. 262). This porch no longer
survives.

appear to be of Ottoman construction.

The building comprises a tomb chamber to the east and a
vaulted hall (which we shall call ‘the western hall’) to the west
and, between these, a corridor giving access to them from a
muqarnas entrance portal on the street. A small chamber over
the corridor is now reached by way of what seems to be a later
vault built into the south end of the western hall; the original
means of access is not known.
 "
13,"Ill HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

There is no inscription to give certain identification. When van
Berchem briefly discussed this building, he wrote that his
assumption that it was the Sa‘diyya Mausoleum was based ‘only
on vague pointers drawn from topography and chronology.""
What Mujir al-Din tells us is that the Sa‘diyya is ‘in the Chain
Gate [Street] opposite the Tankiziyya Madrasa and the Haram
gate.” Two entries in the Jerusalem sijills add further
confirmation,? in that they deal with property to the west of the
Sa‘diyya Mausoleum. This property fronted south on to the
Chain Gate Street and its northern boundary, which was clearly
the northern boundary of the mausoleum as well, is given as
the ribat of the Tankiziyya. The ribat of the Tankiziyya was in the
north-west corner of the little square before the Chain Gate.
This would confirm that the Sa‘diyya may be identified with the
surviving portal and grille-windowed tomb at the north corner
of the thoroughfare as it enters the square.

DATE

No date is recorded anywhere for the erection of this building
but according to Mujir al-Din the deed of endowment was
dated 27 Rabi‘ II 711/12 September 1311.4

FOUNDER

We read in Mujir al-Din that the endowment was made Dy an
amir called Sa‘d al-Din Mas‘ud, son of the Amir Isfahsalar? Badr
al-Din Sunqur b. ‘Abdallah, the Taster from Asia Minor (al-
Rimi). Mas‘ad himself is described as ‘the chamberlain in
Damascus in the reign of al-Nasir Muhammad b. Qalawtn’.
 It is highly unlikely that one can make any sure
identification on such a basis. A search of the main sources
yields little. One may hazard that the father was one of the amirs
from the milieu of the Saljuigqs of Rum who sought refuge in the
Mamlik state. There is a passing reference to the arrest of a
Sungur al-Rimi by Baybars I,° but there are really no grounds
for making any connection.

As for the son, an Amir Mas‘id, who was chamberlain,
makes brief appearances in the reign of al-Nasir between the
years 732-38/1332-38,’ but there are no better grounds than
those above for any positive identification.

The question is in any case complicated by one of the sijills
referred to above.® The property to the west of the Mausoleum
is said to be the endowment of an Amir Sa‘d al-Din b. Amir
Mas‘tid b. Badr al-Din b. ‘Abdallah ‘for his turba within the
domed chamber (qubba). This variation in the name may
simply be an error in the record. It goes on to quote as a
condition of the waqf, however, that the amir should be the
inspector for his lifetime, followed by his son, then his
descendants. The date of the waqf is given as 13 Rabi’ I 789/2
April 1387. But this may well be the date of a later copy, rather
than the date of the original.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

As far as we can tell, there is very little indeed to record of the
history of this building. As it appears, Koranic readings were
still taking place there daily in 984/1576. In that year
Khudawardi b. Husayn al-Khalwati made a waqf of 400 gold
pieces to support four Koran readers at the turba. At the same
time he converted the property to the west, now described as
his house, into a waqf for himself and his male descendants.”
This means that since 936/1555, the date of the other sijill in
which the house is described as a waqf for the turba, the
property had lost its status as a waqf for the mausoleum.
 "
13,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","SOUTH FACADE (fig. 13.4)

The main, south facade is partly obscured by a later vault
spanning the street but the principal features are clear: an
entrance portal and two grilled windows set in a shallow recess
to the right of it (plate 13.1). To the left of the portal the remains
of an arched opening in the masonry of the facade are
 discernible. Only the right-hand springer of the arch survives.
The opening is now blocked by a later wall that extends
westward for some distance up the street. The height and
curvature of the springer indicate that the Opening was
approximately 2.5m wide.

The entrance door is set ina portal recess 1.58m wide and
0.79m deep, spanned by three tiers of mugqarnas corbelling
Supporting a slightly pointed ashlar semidome (plate 13.2).
This is the second muqarnas portal built in Jerusalem, the first
being that of the Dawadariyya (no. 8). The muqarnas.
corbelling is not quite symmetrical for an extra half-niche has
been carved on the facade to the left of the second tier (see
plate 13.3). The blocks of stone in which the muqarnas
 corbelling is carved protrude unevenly on the facade,
suggesting that the carving was done in a workshop and then
found not to fit together perfectly when raised into place. The
extra half-niche may represent an attempt to disguise the
discrepancy. A little arched window opens in the centre of the
two lower tiers.

Under the corbelling, the recess is built of red and
brownish ablag masonry. The upper courses of red masonry
extend unevenly onto the facade (see fig. 13.4). Stone benches
on either side of the recess have curious rounded bases
perhaps intended as foot-rests.

Two courses above the door lintel a very unusual frieze of
inlaid strapwork runs around the recess (plate 13.3). The
grooves to take the inlay are chased in two courses of ashlars to
create a pattern of strapwork enclosing two rows of plain
limestone octagons, altogether four in each side and eight in
the back of the recess. The original inlay has disappeared to be
replaced by a nasty smear of cement, except on the east side
(plate 13.4) where the lower part of the frieze is inlaid with
pieces of cut stone of various colours, and the upper part is
filled with red and black coloured mortar. The cut stone inlay
must be a later insertion for it is crudely done with no attempt
to follow the cardinal rule of strapwork: that individual strands
must cross alternately over and under each other. In the upper
part, however, the red and black strands do cross in the
prescribed manner and it is quite possible that this coloured
mortar is a remnant of the original inlay. The red colour is given
by large quantities of crushed pottery, and the black by large
quantities of charcoal!” in the mix.

On either side of the portal the later street vault springs
from pieces of a cyma recta moulding built into the facade,
which: py-analoovawithithe Dawmadationgs (hace m. 1oa\ may
 once have formed a cornice around the building. No other
pieces of this moulding are known to survive.

To the right of the portal two windows of the tomb
chamber are placed off centre in a shallow recess, 0. 21m deep
(plate 13.1). Though much of the upper part of the recess is
hidden by the later street vaulting, enough is visible to show
that a cavetto moulding runs across the top. Three intrusive re-
used columns, one on the left and two on the right side of the
recess, support that street vaulting. The grilled windows are
built in red and brownish ablag which, at the right-hand side,
 does not extend for the full width of the recess. A panel of
marble, evidently intended for an inscription that was never
carved, is sunk in a frame of red stone above the masonry pier
between the two windows. At a higher level in the recess are
two relieving arches built into the masonry above the windows.

The south-east corner of the building is chamfered up toa
height of 2.98m above the present pavement, presumably in
order to reduce abrasion of the corner. The top of the chamfer
is adjusted to the square corner above by means of two tiers of
delicate muqarnas corbelling.
 EAST FACADE

As plate 13.5 shows, the east facade is almost wholly hidden
behind an ornate fountain erected by order of the Ottoman
Sultan Sulayman the Magnificent in 943/1537. The upper part of
a recess, like the one in the street facade, is, however, visible
above the fountain. A small, high-level window opens in the
middle of that part of the recess.

The north-east corner of the building, to the right of the
fountain, is recognizable in a vertical joint in the masonry
where the wall of the Ribat al-Nisa’ abuts against it (see below,
p. 240). This corner is not chamfered.

INTERIOR (plan, fig. 13.3)

The entrance portal opens into a narrow corridor leading toa
door into the tomb chamber on the right and, opposite that, a
door into the western hall on the left.

@ Tomb chamber

The tomb chamber has pointed-arched recesses of different
depths in all four sides, which reduce the central area to a
perfect square in plan. This central area, now roofed by a cross
vault, was originally covered by a dome as the document cited
above (p. 195) confirms. The recess to the east is much deeper
than the other three, perhaps to provide a place for Koran
readings. It is the extra depth of this recess that accounts for the
asymmetry of the tomb chamber’s street facade.

There are twin openings in the rear wall of each recess.
Those in the north wall (plate 13.6) are now blocked though
they may originally have contained windows. The far (north)
face of this wall, which is the rear wall of an wan in the Ribat
al-Nisa’, reveals no trace of such windows but that face is very
rough and appears to have undergone some rebuilding. Three
courses of modern concrete blocks at the top of the south face
of the wall (see plate 13.6) are further evidence of some
rebuilding. The recesses in the east wall are used as cupboards;
and while careful scrutiny failed to produce evidence that they
ever contained windows, the possibility cannot be ruled out.
The Ottoman fountain precludes examination of the exterior.
 The floor of the chamber is raised about 1.20m above
street level. The eastern part of the floor is 0.23m higher than
the western. A step between the two levels has a westward
salient that forms a base for an unusually small (0.98 x 0.98m)
stone cenotaph. Four octagonal posts with domical caps stand
at the corners of the cenotaph (plate 13.7). These posts are
decorated with two pointed-arched niches in each side,
arranged one above the other. The south-east post has lost its
top; the caps on the other three are carved with eight drooping
petals. The carving of the north-west post is cruder than that of
the others, as if it were a copy of them.

(ti) Western hall
The western hall is roofed by two cross vaults separated by a
transverse arch. It has undergone several changes. The
northern part is blocked off by a later wall, and the southern is
partitioned off and divided into two levels by the insertion of a
low barrel vault.

A room in the lower level (marked ‘Z’ on the plan, fig.
13.3), the floor of which is a little below present street level, is
reached by descending five steps through a door in the
partition wall. This room is lit by a semicircular window on the
street in the masonry that replaces the earlier arch in the street
facade (see above). The west wall of the room has at some time
been carelessly hollowed out to provide extra space.

A short flight of steps against the west wall of the hall leads
up to a door into a room on the upper level, above ‘Z’. This
room is roofed by the continuation of the cross vault of the hall.
It has a window in its north wall opening north on the hall. A
wide, ill-made opening in its east wall gives access to the
narrow, barrel-vaulted chamber, only 2.12m high, that sits
above the entrance corridor. This chamber is lit by the small slit
window opening in the mugarnas corbelling of the entrance

ortal.
; How much of all this is original is hard to tell. From the
traces of an arch in the facade it would appear that the western
hall must have opened directly on the street. It may have been
ashop of some sort, belonging to the original construction and

 "
15,"Il SITE AND BUILDINGS (jig. 14.2)
","At the highest point on the faram border, this important site
has been developed since pre-Islamic times. The Herodian
Tower Antonia stood here (above, p. 43). The present open
compound on the rock outcrop is surrounded on all sides by
various buildings dating from many different periods.

In the middle of the southern part of the compound stood
the Jawiliyya Madrasa. The original form of the madrasa is
known from literary sources. It comprised a large gibla iwan
with two rooms flanking it at the south end of a rectangular
courtyard that was entered from the north and enclosed by
cells on its east, west and north sides. There is no mibrab. Now
only the zwan and its two flanking rooms survive overlooking
the Haram through five windows in an ablaq facade. To the east
of these three rooms are new buildings belonging to a primary
school opened in 1923-24. To the west a range of pre-Mamlik
chambers extends along the southern boundary of the site.
One of these chambers, next to the western room flanking the
zwan, was in the sixth/twelfth century made into a chapel by the
Knights Templar, who also added a domed porch in front of it.
Early in the seventh/thirteenth century the domed porch was
used for the tomb of an Ayyubid amir. This domed porch/tomb
was largely destroyed in the 1920s and only traces of it remain,
though its original appearance is known from early
photographs (see below). All other buildings around the site
appear to be Ottoman or later, some associated with a barracks
built in the nineteenth century and others with the modern
primary school.
 "
15,"Til HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

No precise topographical information is to be found in Mujir al-
Din. He writes that ‘the north portico [of the Haram] stretches
east to west from the Gate of the Tribes (Bab al-Asbat) to the
Jawiliyya Madrasa’.! All the institutions along the north wall of
the Haram are treated by him in a methodical manner. The
argument that can be made to identify the Jawiliyya with the first
foundation met with as one moves eastwards from the
Ghawanima Minaret has been fully elaborated by van
Berchem.’ There is also the argument from the fact that the
Jawiliyya was converted, as we shall see, into the seat of the local
governor. While functioning as such, the building was visited,
and its position made relatively clear, by a series of travellers
down to modern times. Al-‘Umari is our earliest source: ‘At the
 highest point of the wall [the Antonia escarpment] there are five
windows of the madrasa of the Amir Sanjar al-Jawili (may God
have mercy on him). The madrasa has no direct access to the
Haram.” He also describes the long stairs to the minaret [the
Ghawanima Minaret] which gave access to a house belonging to
a member of the Bani Jama‘a family. That house was sold in
952/1545 by a widow of a late member of the same family to
Sinan Bey, the governor of the Sanjak of Jerusalem, for 150
Cypriot gold coins.‘ The house stretched from the Haram
frontage to the street leading east to the Gate of the Tribes or St.
Stephen’s Gate, but its east boundary was the tomb chamber of
Ibn Darbas, a Hakkari Kurdish shaykh who died perhaps in the
early thirteenth century, and the lane leading to it. For our
purposes we note that the tomb of Darbas was described as
adjacent to the Jawiliyya Madrasa.°

DATE

As to the date of the construction or of the endowment, Mujir
al-Din’s text is again silent. We know of only one text other than
those of al-‘Umari and Mujir al-Din, which mentions Sanjar al-
Jawili as the founder of an institution in Jerusalem. That is the
chronicle of Ibn al-Dawadari, which mentions ‘a mosque
(jami’) built by the Amir ‘Alam all Din Sanjar al-Jawili, when he
was governor of Gaza’.° His building elsewhere is well
recorded, not least by inscriptions in Hebron and Gaza. They
date from his period as governor of Gaza, when he also had
responsibility for Jerusalem and Hebron and held the post of
Superintendent of the Two Harams’ (compare the case of Faris
al-Din Ilbaki, p. 337). Sanjar’s building in Jerusalem dates from
the same period, that is to say, 711-20/1311-20. For the
following eight years or so he was imprisoned in Alexandria or
in the citadel in Cairo. Ibn al-Dawadari cannot have intended
the other short period of three months in 743/late 1342 during
which Sanjar was governor of Gaza for the second time, since
his record of events finishes early in 735/autumn 1334 with just
a slight extension into the following year.®

FOUNDER

He was born in 653/1255-56 at Amid (Diyarbakr).? Acceptance
of this date attributes to him impressive longevity, but Ibn Hajar
confirms that he was nearly a hundred when he died. His full
name was ‘Alam al-Din Abt Sa‘id Sanjar b. ‘Abdallah. Whether
‘Abdallah was the real name of his father or the conventional
attribution for a mamlik is not clear. It is recorded that his
 father was known as ‘the commissioner’ (al-mushidd), which
may indicate a career under an Islamic régime. Ibn
Taghribirdi’® guesses that Sanjar may have been a Kurd on the
basis of his Shafi'i affiliation. His birth-place may also support
that opinion.

An amir called Jawil (Chavl1), one of Baybars I’s mamliks,
was Sanjar’s first master and the person from whom he derived
his nésba. After Jawil’s death Sanjar was transferred to Qalawiin,
was sent in the reign of al-Ashraf Khalil to Kerak, and then
served Sultan Kitbugha. His first office, which he exercised
without an amirate, was the governorship of Shawbak. At the
end of the thirteenth century he was acting as deputy Major-
Domo for Baybars the Taster (later to be Baybars ID), while the
latter and the Amir Salar were together running the state. Sanjar
was made an amir in early 698/late 1298, and became close to
the Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad through personal service.!! As
the rivalry of the two great amirs increased, Sanjar and his
alleged peculations became an issue between them. Salar’s
friendship and support could not prevent Sanjar’s being sent
away in 706/1307 as battal to Damascus, where he was given a
tablkhanah amirate.

When al-Nasir Muhammad was preparing his second
restoration to power and came to Damascus from Kerak in
Sha‘ban 709/January 1310, Sanjar was among the amirs who
pledged their allegiance. Al-Nasir used Sanjar to persuade Salar
to submit, a move which led to the latter’s imprisonment and
death in the citadel in 710/1311. Sanjar and Salar had each
appointed the other as executor and guardian of the other’s
children. They had built a joint madrasa near the Mosque of Ibn
Tultin with adjacent tomb chambers. Now Sanjar laid his friend
to rest in one of them. A year later al-Nasir sent Sanjar to be
governor of Gaza!* where he remained until late 720/1320. A
dispute with Tankiz which had its beginnings in 713/1314,
when Sanjar had been commissioned to survey and distribute
igta’s at Damascus,'? now led to his arrest. Released in 728/
1328"" and restored to an amirate in Cairo, Sanjar for a number
of years acted as Inspector of the Hospital and Madrasa of
Qalawin.

In the confused years after the death of al-Nasir, Sanjar was
sent to Hama for a while as governor in 743/1342, and then to
Gaza again,’ returning to Cairo in Sha‘ban 743/January 1343.
Despite his advanced years he commanded troops besieging
the deposed Ahmad, son of al-Nasir, in Kerak during 744/1343-
44. He died either on Thursday, 8 or Friday, 9 Ramadan 7451°/13
or 14 January 1345 in his house at Manazir al-Kabsh near his
Madrasa-Mausoleum, where he was then buried in the
chamber next to Salar.

Sanjar was a man of considerable learning in the law of the
Shafi'T school. While in Kerak he compiled a commentary on
the Musnad of al-ShafiT and towards the end of his life he
issued fatwas. He was of sufficient standing to be included in
Subki’s biographical encyclopaedia of Shafi‘i scholars.””.

His earliest known building is the madrasa-mausoleum he
cooperated to build in Cairo in 703/1303-4.'® An inscription
records the construction of porticoes in his mosque at Gaza in
718/1318-19.""° Ibn Battiita visited it in 1326 and commented on
its ‘solid construction and the minbar made of white marble.”°
Sanjar is said to have bestowed on Gaza the character of a true
city through his building a public square, official residence,
bath, caravanserai and hospital.”! This latter was probably built
and endowed on behalf of Sultan al-Nasir.” He also erected a
Caravanserai at Qaqun, a mosque at Lydda, and an aqueduct at
Arsuf.”* Lastly, his mosque at Hebron was begun in 718/1318
and completed in 720/1320, as a surviving inscription
witnesses.”

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

A Haram document of 795/1393 mentions ‘the waqf of al-Jawili’
as a boundary for a gaa (hall) in Jerusalem, whose position is
not specified.” Indeed, we have no information on the land or
other resources which were provided as the endowment of the
 madrasa. Another document dating from wwo years later
concerns a woman ‘resident in the ribat (sic) of al-Jawilt’.”°

By the lifetime of Mujir al-Din, however, the madrasa had
been converted into the seat of the governor (the dar al-
ntyaba), as he records three times in his work.2” On Monday, 9
Sha'ban 879/18 December 1474 the governor of Gaza, who had
come to Jerusalem on official business, bearing a decree from
the Sultan, ‘held session in the upper portico at the dag al-
niyaba, near the Ghawanima Minaret.”* Although the name of
the Jawiliyya itself is not used, its change of function by that date
is clear. About four years before that, Suyiti had placed the dar
al-niyaba in its new site near the Bab al-Ghawanima.”?
 The madrasa may have been originally transformed into
the seat of government in Jerusalem at the beginning of the
fifteenth century, perhaps in association with the repair works
recorded in a brief inscription found within the existing”
buildings, “His excellency al-Shuja‘t «Shahin. ordered | its’
restoration’2° Van Berchem tentatively identified this person.
with the governor of Jerusalem, Shahin’ al- Dhabbah (the:
Slaughterer), who was in office in 830/1427.; aD ae

A further change took place in 892/1487, (see p. 205,
below). The construction date, inscribed: ‘high up in the
tribunal’ was Muharram 891/January-February 1486, but Mujir
al-Din claims, without explanation, that this was an error and
that the addition to the building was made in Muharram 892/
January 1487.""

The area in the north-west corner of the Haram, including
the site of the Jawiliyya, continued as the seat of government.in.,
Ottoman times until 1870, when the Pasha moved to the new
serai in the ‘Aqabat al-Sitt. Military barracks remained, until the
foundation of the present school, which now occupies the
Jawiliyya compound. .
 "
15,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","EARLIER REMAINS has re
(i) Herodian Tower Antonia ores:
The early history of the site is controversial. Essentially the
controversy centres on the problem of the extent of the Antonia
and its relationship with the Temple ‘enclosure.*® ‘While it
would be inappropriate here to become involved in this
controversy, we should, however, draw attention to two
discoveries made during our survey of the area which cast new
light on the problem.

The first is the existence of a massive wall more than four
metres thick which, where not interrupted by secondary
apertures, forms the southern wall of a row of chambers along
the southern boundary of the site. The three extant rooms of
the madrasa are actually excavated in the thickness of this wall.
Because of its size and location, the wall is doubtless a vestige
of the Antonia. Its eastern extension is broken by modern
school rooms to the east of the Jawiliyya, but further traces have
been identified in the Is‘ardiyya (no. 33).

The second tends to confirm that the north-west corner of
the Herodian Temple enclosure coincided with the present
north-west corner of the Haram where the Ghawanima Minaret
(no. 10) now stands. Towards that corner the natural rock has
been quarried away leaving a scarp of varying height to define
the Haram boundary. On the west side the scarp rises
northward from about the present Bab al-Ghawanima, and on
the north side it rises westward from about the present Bab al-
‘Atm. The line of the north scarp, if projected, would make an
angle of 86/2° with that of the west scarp, but at the west end of
 the north scarp a 9m length of the rockface has been cut back a
further 2.5m or so to form a re-entrant angle at the north-west
corner (plate 14.1). Above that corner a stone (marked ‘C’ on
' the planjfig. 14.2) is, as the distinctive marginal drafting on both
its north and west faces indicates, almost certainly a Herodian

corner stone #i2'situ (plate 14.2).

(ii) Crusader. Chapel

' The ‘Antonia was. largely destroyed in A.D. 70 (above, p. 44).
; Thereafter virtually nothing is known of the history of the site
~ it may well, have lain in ruins — until the second half of the
sixth/twelfth century when, apparently with the
encouragement of the Templars, the association of the site with
the Praetorium or Domus Pilati of Christian tradition was
revived. Connected with the Praetorium in that tradition was
the idea of a ‘Chapel of Repose’ in which Christ is reputed to
. have rested after his capture in Gethsemane. This association
was commemorated by the dedication, evidently in about A.D.
1160,** of a small chapel with a domed porch, some parts of
which survive (plate 14.3) immediately to the west of the
 Two photographs (plates 14.4 and 14.5) from the Matson
Photo Service Collection show the domed porch still standing
after the demolition of much of the madrasa. The porch was
attached to one of the chambers ranged along the south wall of
the compound in such a way as to imply that these chambers
were built before the middle of the sixth/twelfth century; the
precise date of their construction is not known . After Saladin’s
conquest of Jerusalem (above, p. 48), access to Christians must
 have been difficult if not impossible, though the association of
the site with the Praetorium of Pilate endured.”

(iti) Ayyubid grave

The history of the site during the seventh/thirteenth century
remains unknown but for one detail given by Mujir al-Din:

.. . in it [ie. the compound containing the Jawiliyya
Madrasa] is the burial place (madfan) of Shaykh Darbas al-
Kurdi al-Hakkari . . >

Today a burial place is marked by a low stone cenotaph — the
only visible indication of a grave within the compound — under
the remains of the domed Crusader porch.*’ While the
unweathered condition and fresh pick-dressing of the stone
cenotaph suggest that it is of relatively recent manufacture, it is
not unreasonable to suppose that it replaces an older cenotaph
marking the grave of ‘Shaykh Darbas’ whose misbas, al-Kurdi al-
Hakkari, show that he belonged to the notable Kurdish tribe of
Hakkari.** Many of the Hakkari tribe fought alongside Saladin,
some ultimately settling in Jerusalem, and several are known to
have been buried there between 587/1191 and 614/1217-18.°
Thus, although the date of Shaykh Darbas’s death is not
specified, we may be justified in assuming that he, like those
fellow tribesmen, died some time around the beginning of the
seventh/thirteenth century.

JAWILIYYA MADRASA

The subsequent history of the site is unusually well
documented partly because, from the beginning of the ninth/
fifteenth century” until the beginning of the thirteenth/
nineteenth century, it was the administrative headquarters, the
Government House of the successive Mamlik and Ottoman
governors of Jerusalem, and partly as a result of the continuing
Christian tradition linking it with the Praetorium.

LATER RENOVATIONS AND ALTERATIONS
Renovations were decreed (rusima bi-tajdid), completed by
the Amir Shuja‘ al-Din Shahin probably about 832/1429, and
were commemorated in a short inscription (see p. 204).""
These may have been necessitated by the conversion of the
Jawiliyya compound to the Government House (dar al-
niyaba).

Further changes made at the end of the ninth/fifteenth
century are recorded by Mujir al-Din:

In 892 (1486-87) the Amir Khidrbak, governor of
Jerusalem, built at the Government House the loggia
(magqad) next to the north side of the van of justice
(hukm). He had it made according to the manner of
Chambers of Justice (majalis al-bukkdm) in Egypt with a
ceiling of painted wood. Formerly the Governor sat in the
foremost part (bi-sadr: i.e. in the southern part next to the
windows)” of the zwdn but afterwards he sat in the loggia
and this is more appropriate than the previous
arrangement . . .¥

As we shall see (below, p. 207) no vestige of these particular
extensions and alterations described by Mujir al-Din appear to
have survived. After the Ottoman conquest of Jerusalem in 922/
1517 the Jawiliyya compound continued to serve as the
Government House. By the end of the sixteenth century
restricted Christian access to the place was possible.** Indeed,
Bernardino Amico included a sketch of the interior in his
Tratto delle Piante et Imagini de i Sacri Edificii di Terra Santa®
but the rendering is too stylized to convey an accurate
impression of the buildings. However, his accompanying
commentary includes the observation that the zwdan was then
still in use for the administration of justice:

... here one enters a big salon of thirty steps in length and
fifteen in width, the windows of which salon open on the
south and look out on the piazza of the Temple. They say
that in this salon was the praetorium, where Christ was
sentenced to death and today also justice is administered
here.*°
 About thirty years later another Christian observer, Pére
Eugene Roger (A.D. 1632), was gratified by the lack of success
of some building operations on the site:

When this Moustafa Bay [Governor of Jerusalem] made this
place a Stable, he built above a chamber where his wives
could come from their lodging; but as soon as it was
finished it fell, and was demolished; and having been re-
erected, and almost completed, it fell for the second time,
so that this sacred site remains entirely as it was before .. .‘”

Elzear Horn’s description of the Praetorium, written in the
second quarter of the eighteenth century, is notable for its
uncommonly precise description, which gives a clear
impression of the layout. It shows that by then parts of the
Jawiliyya Madrasa were already neglected:

... and one comes to the centre of thirteen steps, by which
one ascends to the gate, within which, advancing to the
south for a distance of eleven feet and having ascended
three other steps, one enters into the little atrium [i.e. the
courtyard of the Jawiliyya Madrasa] of the Praetorium,
which is twenty-six feet wide and fifty feet long .. . the place
is open to the sky and paved with hewn square stones; on
either side it has five small rooms; on the east side only
one is inhabited, on the west side one serves for
deliquents to bé imprisoned with chains to be fastened
around the neck; on either side of the aforesaid entrance
there are a further two; of all the rest of them some are
empty and others are blocked up with stones . .. From this
little atrium, or more justly I should say little cloister, one
ascends by two steps through the gate to the Praetorium,
which is twenty-six feet long and nineteen and a quarter
wide . . . There are two doors, one to the right and the
other to the left; both give access to a small cubicle; that to
the west, standing against the west wall, does not give
access elsewhere, although formerly, by thirteen steps,
there was a way to the upper part of the house .. .*

In 1835 when Jerusalem was under the rule of Ibrahim Pasha,
the Jawiliyya was rebuilt as barracks:

During this month, August 1835, the Praetorium of Pilate
was finished. It was formerly a serai, or palace for the
Pashas and governors of Jerusalem but it is now the gishlaq
or barracks of the regular soldiers of Ibrahim Pasha. It had,
in virtue of its age, to be almost entirely rebuilt from the
foundation. Dressed stones were taken from many ruins
throughout the city for its rebuilding...”

And so it remained until the Turkish surrender of Jerusalem to
the advancing British forces in 1917. Van Berchem, who visited
the site in 1914, states that at that time it was an infantry
barracks, adding that in one of the upper rooms he was
received by the military governor of Jerusalem.” Van
Berchem’s description, written almost two centuries after that
 of Elzear Horn (above) and accompanied by a sketch plan (fig.
14.4) but no photograph of the interior, suggests, however, that
during the period the Jawiliyya Madrasa underwent no major
structural changes, only a steady deterioration:

...a wretched staircase E ... by which one ascends to an
old doorway P, to come out by way of a vestibule V into a
rectangular courtyard C with its main axis aligned north-
south enclosed by walls of dressed stone. Its three sides,
north, east and west are pierced by doors opening into
vaulted cells; the walls of the cells are still standing but in
an advanced state of ruin. The south side is entirely
occupied by a large pointed arch A, which formerly
opened into the qibla iwén LS . . . Today this arch is
blocked by a wall in which a low door p has been made...
The door gives access to the iwén LS, which consists of a
large barrel-vaulted hall, flanked by two smaller cross-
vaulted rooms. These three chambers, extending to the
south beyond some unsightly modern partitions open on
the Haram through five grilled windows.*!

The latest phase in the architectural evolution of the site
occurred in 1923-24 during the British Mandate when the
compound was taken over for a new school, which involved
many structural changes including the destruction of some
buildings and the construction of new ones. A summary
Arabic inscription over the street entrance records the event:

The structure (#mdra) of this madrasa was renewed
(juddida) by the Supreme Islamic Shari‘a Council; the
year 1342 (1923-24)

Though much of the Jawiliyya Madrasa no longer survives,
its initial layout can be determined from the accounts outlined
above and its position in the central part of the surrounding
compound is defined by the gibla twain and its flanking rooms.
The brief description which follows is restricted to the Jawiliyya
Madrasa alone and reference to adjoining buildings is made
only where they have some bearing on the analysis of the
Jawiliyya. It will suffice here to note that, apart from the massive
southern wall — a vestige of the Tower Antonia on which abut
the more or less intact walls of some pre-Mamliak structures
including the Crusader ‘Chapel of the Repose’ — all other
construction around the compound appears to be either
Ottoman or modern.

HARAM FACADE

The northern boundary of the Haram at its west end consists,
up to a varying height, of scarped rock. At higher levels the rock
is revetted with masonry, which displays variations suggesting
several phases of work (plate 14.6). Only at the very base of the
revetment are there marginally drafted ashlars in the Herodian
style (visible in plate 14.7); the heterogeneous facing of the
upper wall is doubtless the result of later, post-Herodian
repairs which have masked the full extent and height to which
the ancient wall survives. However, the continuing line of the
inner face of the wall is indicated by the precise alignment of
the southern ends of the series of rooms shown in fig. 14.2
along the southern boundary of the site. In the three rooms of
the madrasa the line is represented by a slight restriction in the
width of each room. All this shows that the wall still stood at this
ae when the madrasa and other structures to the west were

uilt,

Thus the ablaq facade of alternate courses of red and
cream-coloured limestone was built as a decorative facing
against the ancient wall, incorporating five windows arranged
symmetrically about the central axis (plate 14.7). The ablaq
facing extends laterally only a short distance beyond the two
outermost windows and the upper limit is defined by a simple
moulded string course (damaged at the left-hand, western
end). Slight but consistent variations in the degree of
Projection, size and texture of the masonry® to the west and
east of the ablaq facade suggest that at the time of the
construction of the Jawiliyya the string course over the

puede. Soh <A gaat LY gan Chae emt | pie Nr geen ea to AMM eo aes,
 windows nearly coincided with the top of the ancient wall. The
vaults of the gibla iwdn and its flanking rooms must originally
have protruded above the skyline®! The two rectangular
windows and central oculus now concealed behind a caper
bush in the facade above the string course (plate 14.7) may
belong to later repairs or rebuilding (see below): al-‘Umari
mentions only ‘five windows of the Madrasa of the Amir ‘Alam
al-Din Sanjar al-Jawilt’.>

The rooms above the iwan’s vault, indeed all the rooms at
the uppermost floor level, appear to be Ottoman.® The two-
storey range of schoolrooms to the east was built in 1923-24.

ENTRANCE

The position of the steps leading up to the present entrance to
the Jawiliyya compound from the street, Tariq al-Saray al-
Qadim, which forms the northern boundary of the compound,
has not changed since at least the sixteenth century.” The
means of access to the compound from the street in the
fourteenth century is not recorded, though such access
certainly existed since al-‘Umari states specifically that there
was no direct access from the Haram.

Nothing more is known of the entrance to the Jawiliyya
Madrasa itself (van Berchem’s ‘old doorway P’ leading into a
small vestibule to the inner courtyard) than we can read in
Horn or van Berchem.

INTERIOR
Within the present compound a rectangular podium (plate
14.8) projects northwards in front of the gibla iwan of the
madrasa. The podium is now split in two levels, the lower one
being reached by a narrow flight of eight steps and the upper
one by five steps more, thirteen in all, from the adjoining
schoolyard. The mural masonry of the podium is a
heterogeneous assemblage incorporating several re-used
stones bearing Crusader masons’ marks which affirm its post-
Crusader date of construction. On the evidence of Elzear Horn,
corroborated by van Berchem’s description and plan, it is clear
that the east boundary of the madrasa approximately coincided
with that of the podium. The western and northern limits of the
madrasa are not so clearly defined.

Following Horn’s description, which is substantiated by
van Berchem’s plan, we find no direct connection between the
madrasa and the earlier domed chapel over the grave of Shaykh
 Darbas against which the missing western wall of the madrasa
must have abutted. According to Horn’s measurements (width
of iwadn = 191% feet [actually 20 feet/6.11m], depth of zwdn 26
feet [actually 27 feet 10 inches/8.48m], length of courtyard = 50
feet/say, 16m, length of vestibule 11 feet/say, 2.5m) the
northern boundary of the madrasa was about 3.7m beyond the
present northern limit of the podium.*

The tunnel-vaulted gibla iwan is two steps above the
upper level of the podium and was, according to Horn, three
steps above the courtyard of the madrasa.® With a span of
6.11m and a maximum height of 7.18m the ivan would have
dominated the courtyard. Indeed, the reason for raising the
courtyard and its surrounding cells on a podium must have
been simply in order Practically to match the level of the
courtyard with that of the zwan,. Plainly the higher ground level
 at the south side of the compound, the site of the 7wdn,
determined the floor level of the zwan, which in turn governed
the level of the adjoining courtyard.

The iwén appears to survive in its original form, though
certain variations in the stonework at the springing of the
bipartite tunnel vault ( plate 14.9) together with the abominable
repointing of the exterior (plate 14.10) denote the later repairs.
As we have seen (above, p. 204), the southern section of the
iwan is, at least for the lower part, hewn out of the ancient
 Antonia wall. The line of the ancient wall is indicated by a slight
reduction in the width of the zwdan (plate 14.11). The back wall
of the ivan is pierced by three grilled windows overlooking
the Haram, the central one being much taller and wider than
the side ones.

Each of the rooms flanking the iwdn was originally
entered through a side door in the fore part of the zd; the
doors in the rear part of the Zvdn and in the north walls of the
rooms themselves (against which the cells of the madrasa
abutted) are later insertions.” Both rooms are similar in
construction, spanned by a lofty cross vault springing from
corbelled imposts (fig. 14.3), with a deep barrel-vaulted recess
hewn into the ancient Antonia wall to admit light from a
rectangular grilled window in the middle of the south wall.
There is a small window high in the south wall (opening on the
Haram facade) and in the north wall. A doorway, now blocked,
in the west wall of the western flanking room led to the
Crusader chapel, the ‘Chapel of Repose’ (above, p. 204), from
where the later staircase to an upper floor (as described by
Horn) was reached.

(plate 14.10). Each blazon is squarely incised in a slab of
marble evidently to receive a filling of paste or bitumen, but
only a blackish stain remains in the now empty grooves. As van
Berchem observed,” there must originally have been three
blazons set symmetrically, of which the left one is now missing.
Whether the masonry course in which they are set is in its
original position is impossible to say. A graffito on the right-
hand slab, reading ‘Mahmid Yusuf’, looks like the name of a
workman perhaps engaged in some restoration of the facade.

33 According to the formerly accepted view, parts of Antonia survive to the north
of the Jawiliyya compound under the Convent of the Sisters of Zion and the
Franciscan Convent (L.H. Vincent and M.A. Stéve, Jérusalem de l’Ancien Testament
..., Paris, 1954-56, 193-221; Marie-Aline de Sion, La Fortresse Antonia a Jerusalem
et la Question du Prétoire, Jerusalem, 1956). Pére Benoit has argued most
convincingly that Antonia did not extend nearly so far north (P. Benoit, ‘L’Antonia
d’Hérode le Grand et le forum oriental d’Aelia Capitolina’, Harvard Theological
Review, \xiv, 1971, 135-67), and though the archaeological evidence is scanty, this
is now the generally accepted view. Two differing views of the relationship
between Antonia and the Temple enclosure are presented by, for example, J.
Simons, Jerusalem in the Old Testament, Leiden, 1952, 413-20, and J. Wilkinson,
Jerusalem as Jesus knew it, London, 1978, 59-61, but both these views should be
revised in the light of our recent discoveries.

chapel, seeJ. Folda, ‘Three Crusader Capitals inJerusalem’, Levant,x, 1978, 139-55.

37 Some indication of the grave certainly existed in the eighteenth century for
Elzear Horn remarked that ‘near the chapel in which there was formerly a Turkish
tomb (sepulchrum Turcicum), and still is, one enters a room which is rather dark
...' (Elzear Horn, Ichnographiae Monumentorum Terrae Sanctae (1724-1744),
ed. and tr, E. Hoade: Publications of the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum No. 15,
Jerusalem, 1962, 148). The Ayyubid preference for domed tombs combines with
the unusual character of the decoration to confuse the problem of the architec-
tural origins of this little dome (M. de Vogiié, Eglises de la Terre Sainte, Paris, 1860,
300, pl. xxii; H. Vincent and F-M Abel, /érusalem Nouvelle, ii, Paris, 1922, 587-95,

of St Anne [the Salahiyya Madrasa] were demolished for the stone to be re-used in
the construction of barracks. Cf. CIA (Ville), 226 n. 3. In the first half of the
ninteenth century the roof of the ‘Governors palace’ had become the usual
vantage-point for foreigners wishing to view the Haram (see, e.g., the letter from
Frederick Catherwood recounting his experiences in 1883, reproduced in W.H.
Bartlett, Walks about the City and Environs of Jerusalem, London, 1844, 148-65).
By the 1860s the view was regularly photographed (Anon. (photographs by John
Anthony), 7he City of our Lord. Twelve Photographs of Jerusalem, London, 1861,
plates facing pages 8 and 10; Francis Bedford, Holy Land and Syria,London 1865,
pl.6B). The absence of photographs of the interior from this period (see below,
n. 58) may be explained rather by lack of interest on the part of photographers —
understandable when one considers the much greater attraction of the alternative
view to the south over the Haram — than security precautions such as those which
nowadays prohibit the photographing of military installations throughout the
Middle East.

by the shallow and indecisive cutting of the muqarnasdt, the related star-shaped
window, and their situation at the upper floor level. These windows were
erroneously associated with the Muhaddathiyya Madrasa (waqf dated 762/1360) in
M. Burgoyne, ‘Chronological Index to the Muslim Monuments of Jerusalem’,
Architecture of Islamic Jerusalem: an exhibition prepared on the occasion of the
World of Islam Festival, London 1976, Jerusalem, 1976, No. 77. The windows

than the original level of the courtyard.

60 The absence of reveals seems generally to be a characteristic of new openings
slapped in existing walls, as opposed to openings initially incorporated into the
original design, which usually have reveals. Of course in this instance the lateral
openings in the rear part of the zvdn are cut through the core of the ancient
Antonia wall, but the excessively high (60 cm) sills suggest that these openings
were never intended to be doors.

61 The notion that the split keystone (i.e. a median joint at the crown of an arch)
was an exclusive feature of Crusader architecture was refuted long ago: see e.g.,

16,"If SITE AND BUILDING (ig. 15.2)
","The building has no inscription but its identification is certain
from texts of al-‘Umari and Mujir al-Din. Only part of the
madrasa now survives, but its site has always been bounded on
the east by Birkat Bani Isra’il and by Tariq Bab Hitta and that
gate itself on the west. Its east — west development has thus
been strictly confined. It is bounded on the south by the Haram
into which it protrudes a little further than the south porch of
Bab Hitta. That southern extension has today no direct link at
ground floor level with the main building, but that it was part of
the Karimiyya is indicated by topographical notes of al-‘Umari
and Mujir al-Din (p. 212 below).

At the north end of the site all the present buildings appear
to be of Ottoman or more recent date. The original boundary
there cannot be determined with precision. The property ends
in a modern stone wall.

An original upper floor in the central part of the complex
comprises five rooms. The rooms over these rooms and over
the southern extension into the Haram are Ottoman and later.
 "
16,"Il HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

In al-‘Umari’s description of the north wall of the Haram, which
he wrote about 745/1345, he mentions! a length of portico,
reaching to where the minaret of the Gate of the Tribes (Bab al-
Asbdt) is now, and then immediately to the west an area of open
ground, where ‘the intention has been to build a portico, but it
has not so far been completed. .. Next to this ground comes the
Karimiyya Madrasa. It has enclosed? the portico in front of it
with two walls, one to the west and another to the east, and two
‘summer chambers’ (masifayn) have been made before it? . . .
This madrasa was built by Karim al-Din ‘Abd al-Karim, the
Inspector of the Sultan al-Nasir’s Privy Purse (7dazir al-khawdass
al-sharifa al-sultaniyya, al-Nasiriyya). Immediately after the
madrasa comes a gate, called the Bab Hitta. . .’

Behind the Haram wall the eastward extension of the
Karimiyya was limited by Birkat Bani Isra’il. The madrasa is
given in a sijill entry of 937/1531 as the west boundary of a
plantation which by then occupied part of the Pool.*

DATE
Muiir al-Din has recorded for ue the date of the endqwment
 al-Din visited Jerusalem with Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad in
717/1317-18,° and it has been assumed that his madrasa was
started then. However, he also visited Damascus early 718/
spring 1318, ordered the construction of a mosque at al-
Qubaybat, and then paid a visit to Jerusalem’ — perhaps with the
scheme for this madrasa in mind.

FOUNDER

Karim al-Din was one of the great state officials of the early
fourteenth century.® He was a Copt by origin, born about 654/
1256. While still a Christian he was known as Akram Abua’l-
Fada’il. He was a nephew of the high official, Taj al-Din b. Sa‘id
al-Dawla (died 709/1309). We first hear of Karim al-Din in 695/
1295-96 as an accountant in the bureau of the Royal Household
in the reign of Kitbugha.” No doubt with the support of his
uncle, who was an important figure behind Baybars the Taster
(Sultan 708-9/1308-9), Karim al-Din rose into prominence, and
eventually succeeded to his offices when he died.!° Earlier, in
702/1302-3, he had been compelled to convert to Islam by
Baybars before he could enter his service, and in due course he
changed his name to Karim al-Din ‘Abd al-Karim.""!

The return of al-Nasir Muhammad to power (709/1309)
and the deposition of Baybars II put Karim al-Din’s career
in danger, but he won new favour by his eagerness to secure
half of Baybars: s large estate for al-Nasir and by judicious bribes
to amirs’* He concentrated all the offices of state in his own
hands or those of his followers, ousting rivals such as Amin al-
Din ‘Abdallah |(see p. 249) | in 713/1313-14. The power and
influence he wielded were very great, yet his recent convert
status made him vulnerable in the sometimes bitter religious
atmosphere of the period. He was involved in the scandal of the
use of mosque lamps in a church (in 714/1314-15), and was
accused of protecting Christians during the terrible fires of 721/
1321, when rumours of arson were rife and Christian fanatics
admitted their part in spreading the blaze in revenge for recent
popular excesses against churches. Such events helped to
range important amirs against Karim al-Din. Already his
position and his lordly generosity roused much envy. In the
end denigration worked Ce the Sultan, who was himself feeling
out-shone by his minister.’

On Thursday, 14 Rabi‘ II 723/21 April 1323 Karim al-Din
was arrested and all his property sequestered. Expelled first to
Shawhak. then to Terusalem and brieflv recalled to Cairq he
 was finally sent to Upper Egypt, where he died at Aswan in
Shawwal 724/October 1324, possibly by hanging himself.!4

Apart from many pensions and allowances provided for
scholars and men of religion, Karim al-Din built various
religious foundations, including a congregational mosque
(Jami’) in Cairo, a Sufi establishment (kbangab) in the suburb
of Qarafa,'’” and also a tomb chamber there, where he was
obliged to reside for a while after his arrest.!° Two mosques in
Damascus are attributed to him. One was in al-Qubaybat, which
was inaugurated in Sha‘ban 718/October 1318, and the other
was at Qabiin.!”

Before Karim al-Din was sent into exile at Shawbak he was
made to testify that all his waqfs had been made from property
purchased not from his own, but from the Sultan’s, funds. This
would have rendered them illegal, but the Sultan confirmed
their status and dubbed them collectively ‘the Nasiri waqf.'

ENDOWMENT

There is no entry in the Ottoman defters nos. 522 and 602. Two
waqf properties in Jerusalem, mentioned as boundaries for
other properties, are all that have been met with in the sijills.
They are a vaulted chamber (gabw) in the al-Tabbaba (?)
district and a blacksmith’s shop in David's Quarter.”

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

There is some doubt, purely on the basis of the literary
evidence involved, whether it has been correct to hold that an
assembly hall (majma‘) of the Karimiyya was built at the same
time as the Ghadiriyya Madrasa, a little to the east, in 836/1432-
33.” The assumption has been that the majma‘ replaced the
 parts of the Karimiyya described by al-‘Umari”! at ground-floor
level under the portico. This has all been based on a passage in
Mujir al-Din” in which he dealt with the history of the north
portico of the Haram. He had no firm evidence for the section
from the Gate of the Tribes to the Ghadiriyya but held that
‘circumstances indicated’ that it was built at the same time as the
minaret, that is, in 769/1367-68. He then continued, ‘The
portico below the Ghadiriyya was built with it [i.e. at the same
time as the Ghadiriyya], and similarly the majma‘ of the
Karimiyya.’ It seems out of context for the author here to be
giving the date of the majma‘ relative to the Ghadiriyya. The
passage concerns the dating of the various sections of the
portico, each of which Mujir al-Din believed, as it seems, to
correspond in date to the building above it. It is possible that
Mujir al-Din meant ‘. . . and similarly the majma‘ of the
Karimiyya, [the portico below it was also built at the same time
as it was]. It must be said that this is not an argument for the
truth of Mujir al-Din’s statement, but only for what he may
reasonably be understood to have intended. Whatever the truth
of the chronology —and, in fact, we may see from al-‘Umari that
it is probably incorrect, because the latter’s text assumes the
existence of the portico before the madrasa’s construction —
Mujir al-Din could be pointing to an original majma ‘above the
portico, quite independent of the arrangement in the portico
itself. Much, if not most, of the original structure has been lost.
The concern here is merely to point out the ambiguity of the
wording in Mujir al-Din’s text.

Later references to the Karimiyya are not very numerous.
There is none in the Haram documents, and those in the
Jerusalem sijills already alluded to are negligible.
 It has been claimed” that Abii ‘Abdallah Muhammad al-
Gharnati, whom Ibn Battita met in Jerusalem in 726/1326, was
‘shaykh of the Karimiyya Khanqah’, and the use of that term has
caused some discussion. What the text says, however, is ‘shaykh
of the noble khanqah (shaykb al-khanqab al-karimay. The
reference is not clear, but it would make sense if it were to a
Maliki institution, and it is known that a zawiya did exist in the
Moroccans’ Quarter along with the Afdaliyya Madrasa, where al-
Gharnati was teaching.”’
 The scholarly personnel known to have held positions in
the Karimiyya in the Mamlik period were members of the
Qalqashandi family and hence of Shafi‘ite allegiance.”° In the
Ottoman period the sijills indicate that the officials of the
Karimiyya were provided by the Jarallah family, who were
Hanafis. The mere naming of those who held the posts of
shaykh or mudarris, or some fraction thereof, does not really
justify the claim that the Karimiyya functioned actively for five
centuries. The Jarallah family is resident in the building down
to the present day.””

16,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","ENTRANCE

The entrance portal (plate 15.1) is on the east side of Tariq Bab
Hitta immediately to the north of the Ayyibid north porch of
the gate. It is remarkable for its simplicity: a shallow pointed-
arched recess flanked by stone benches and enclosing a plain
rectangular doorway (now blocked) surmounted by a large
monolithic lintel. Above the lintel a recessed panel,
presumably intended for an inscription, is like most of the rear
wall of the recess now covered with plaster bearing traces of a
painted geometric decoration (plate 15.1). To the north of the
entrance the large ashlars of the portal peter out into a later wall
of small, quarry-finished, coursed masonry containing a plain
door which serves as the present entrance. Beyond the present
entrance there is another door opening to a relatively modern

stairway, which is now the only means of access to the upper
floor.

INTERIOR

(@) Ground floor (fig. 15.3)

The vestibule inside the original entrance is a narrow passage
running north and south, reflecting the overall narrowness of
the site. A narrow stone bench is squeezed against the east wall.
In spite of subsequent alterations it can be inferred that from
the beginning the vestibule opened in two directions:
northward into a secondary porch and thence into a central
courtyard; southward directly into the principal chamber of the
madrasa (see below).

The central feature on the ground plan (fig. 15.3) is an
open courtyard extending from north to south into a tunnel-
vaulted iwan, which led into a cross-vaulted ‘transverse
chamber’, the principal ground floor room. A later arch has
been added to the front of the original ivan opening (plate
15.2). It has a double row of voussoirs, which in Jerusalem is
typical of Ottoman arch construction. Other Ottoman changes
affecting these central rooms are a partition inserted to divide
the zwdan from the transverse chamber and another partition
wall which divides that chamber itself into two parts. Thinking
away those intrusive structures leaves us with a T-shaped unit as
the original Mamlik form for these rooms, and that an unusual
one.

In the east wall of the transverse chamber are a window
overlooking the Birkat Bani Isra’il and a door surmounted bya
window into a small vaulted room with two windows, one
above the other, facing north and a third facing east on to the
same pool (see plate 15.9). The chamber is additionally lit by a
 semicircular-arched window in the west wall; the building of
this wall blocked up the east-facing arch of the north porch of
Bab Hitta.

There are two alcoves in the south wall, being in fact the
north wall of the Haram. For the purpose of these see p. 217
below.

(ii) Staircase

A small barrel-vaulted room to the east of the iwvdn gives
evidence of the original staircase giving access to the upper
floor. The far side of this room is spanned by a transverse
tunnel vault rising steeply from north to south and revealing
the existence of a staircase. The steps have been removed and
the end of the stairway, where it passed through the north wall
of the room, has been blocked, so that it is impossible to say
exactly how the stairs were entered at ground level. But the
stair shaft (plate 15.3), lit by a small window in the east wall,
penetrates the south wall of the room 2.65m above the floor;
the pitch of the rising vault makes it possible to calculate the
position of the top step, emerging in the upper floor.

(tit) Upper floor (fig. 15.4)

From the top of the stairs a narrow vaulted passage or corridor
follows an angular U-shaped course to give access to all the
upper floor rooms. It is poorly lit by only one small window just
above floor level at the head of the stairs and by borrowed light
from a central stairway from the east — west run of the corridor
up to the roof of the Haram portico (see below). From the stair-
head the corridor continues south to a point above the middle
of the Haram wall, where it turns west along the top of the wall
 (here 2.40m thick) and reaches the shoulder of Bab Hitta,
where it turns northward and leads to an open landing directly
above the entrance portal and vestibule and at the head of the
modern staircase.

It was this landing, at the far end of the corridor, which
gave access to the principal upper floor room, located directly
above the ground floor zwvan. The room is cross-vaulted and has
two windows overlooking the courtyard. Openings in the south
wall give access to two smaller rooms, both barrel-vaulted. The
eastern of these was originally entered by a door (now
blocked) close to the head of the stairs; its present door from
the principal room is shown by the absence of reveals to be
secondary; the room has another door, also secondary,
opening from the east — west run of the corridor. The walls of
these rooms are of unusual thickness, not matched by those at
ground level; we have no explanation of this anomaly.

The landing, which serves as a porch for these rooms, is
now open but was formerly roofed, as is shown by the traces of
the springing of a vault at its north-east corner. At the south-
west corner there _— re-used pieces of moulding, apparently
of Crusader origin,” arranged in such a manner as to suggest
 that there was originally an arched opening to the west
overlooking the street (plate 15.4).

It emerges, thus, that the main upper floor room was
reached from the street by a tortuous route across the
courtyard of the madrasa, up the stairs and along the U-shaped
corridor to arrive at the porch directly over the entrance portal.
The layout is logical, however. It lends privacy to the principal
rooms while affording views of the street and the courtyard of
the madrasa. On the way, the passage served other rooms: first,
from the stairhead, after the small room (described above)
adjacent to the principal room, it passed a double-cross-vaulted
rectangular room overlooking Birkat Bani Isra’il by windows in
its north and east walls. In its east — west run the passage is
about 1.10m wide and seems to have been cut through the
rubble core of the upper part of the Haram wall. At its east end
there is a latrine recess 1.45m deep; and at the west a
continuation (now partly blocked) which extends over Bab
Hitta itself as far as the western limit of that gate, adjoining the
Awhadiyya (no. 9). In the north wall of this continuation an
irregular opening has been made, apparently at some later
date, to connect the passage with a room over the northern
 porch of Bab Hitta. This room seems to be an integral part of the
Karimiyya and not an earlier structure incorporated into it; a
small change in the style of the exterior masonry of its north
wall (plate 15.5) indicates that it was a later addition built over
the roof of the porch. The principal entrance to the room is
from the west side of the northward return of the corridor.

A short flight of nine steps sheltered by a stone canopy
leads up from the middle of the east — west run of the corridor
to the originally open roof of the Haram extension — with a fine
view of the Haram — and from there to the roofs of the upper
floor rooms described above. d

A variety of rooms, Ottoman or later, have been built on
the roofs of the upper floor rooms of the madrasa and its Haram
extension.
 HARAM EXTENSION (plan, fig. 15.3)

One, if not both, of the two alcoves seen in the south wall of the
transverse chamber (p. 214 above) must formerly have
penetrated the wall, for Mujir al-Din lists the Karimiyya as one
of those madrasas that had direct access to the Haram as well as
a door opening outside it. The distinctive configuration of the
western alcove suggests that it was hewn out of the core of the
Haram wall. The eastern alcove appears better suited to
accommodate the four or five steps that would have been
necessary to reach the floor of the Haram extension which is
1.20m above that of the transverse chamber (see fig. 15.6). The
drawing of fig. |15.7 shows an opening linked with the eastern
alcove.

That the structures south of the Haram wall were regarded
as part of the Karimiyya is proved by al-‘Umari’s description of
the north wall of the Haram (see above). The ‘portico’ seen by
al-‘Umari had become for Mujir al-Din a ‘majma’ (see above);
for both it is part of the Karimiyya. The conversion will have
taken place (if simultaneously with the Ghadiriyya Madrasa) in
or about 836/1432. Al-Umari has more to say of the topography.
From the dimensions he gives it is obvious that in his day the
land to the east of the Karimiyya Madrasa, between it and the
spot later occupied by the Bab al-Asbat Minaret (1367-68), was
open. In front (a@mdamahda) of the Karimiyya, he says, was a
portico with two walls, east and west. The length of 25 dhird ‘is
specified for the madrasa but in a context (above, p. 104) which
indicates that it was the length of the portico that was measured.
Al-‘Umari usually only gives dimensions of the porticoes and
the gates, never of the buildings outside the Haram walls. We
know from analysis of other dimensions given by al-‘Umari that
his dhira‘ equals approximately 0.69-0.70m and so 25 dhira‘
equals approximately 17.25-17.50m. In fact the present
structure in front of the madrasa measures 17.57m from east to
west — a sufficiently close correspondence to indicate that it at
least occupies the same site as the original portico.

The west wall of the Haram extension, which blocks the
eastern arch of the south porch of Bab Hitta, appears to belong
to the original construction (p/ate 15.6). In the centre there is
a rectangular window with a monolithic lintel surmounted by
a tabula ansata frame, probably in re-use and apparently
intended for an inscription that was never carved. The iron
window grille has large spherical bosses at the intersections, a
common Mamluk feature.

Below the window a low door opens into a small chamber
used until recently as a cistern.” It is roughly three metres
eauare and hasasimnple nointed-arched mihrab cut in its south
 wall. Three steps lead down to the plastered floor which is
about 1.25m below ground level (fig. 15.6). Flanking the door
are two stone benches which are probably those described by
al-‘Umari as ‘abutting the aforementioned Karimiyya’.”

As for the Haram frontage, bearing in mind that al-‘Umari
speaks of an arcade or portico (arwiqa) and not merely a single
arch or bay (generally ‘aqd), we can tentatively restore the
original facade as a portico of three arches as in fig. 15.7.

In a second phase, following the collapse of that portico,
the central arch was restored but those which flanked it were
replaced by walls. The plain doorway (now blocked) to the
west of the arch and the window to the east belong to this phase
of construction. The present structure is probably little altered
from that seen by Mujir al-Din. The interior of the hall, now
divided by modern partitions, is vaulted in three bays separated
by distorted transverse arches. The two eastern bays are cross-

2 We read here bazat as in Bodleian Ms. Pococke 191, fol. 39b. This has the same
consonantal outline as the jarat in the Ms. used by Ahmad Zaki Pasha, although he
read jawarat for his edition.

3 The exact significance of masifayn here is not clear. The word is explained in
Cl. Denizeau, Dictionnaire des parlers arabes de Syrie, Liban et Palestine, Paris,
1960, as ‘terrasse de maison (on y dort pendant I’été)’. ‘Before it (quddama-hay,
with reference to the madrasa, is replaced in Ms. Pococke 191, loc. cit. supra, by
quddama-huma’, which can only mean ‘before them’, the two walls. This is
puzzling, unless al-‘Umari meant ‘in the portico in front of the walls on an east —

west axis’, as though there were two chambers at either end of that enclosed part
of the portico.

 vaulted and the western bay, curiously, is barrel-vaulted. At
some later date the central arch was blocked, and of five
windows made in the blocking masonry only the lower pair
(plate 15.7) are now open; the upper three (paired rectangular
windows with a circular oculus above their common mullion)
were blocked before 1920 when Creswell’s photograph (plate
15.8) was taken. Also before 1920 a stone shaft, now choked up,
was built against the Haram frontage, presumably to connect
the dwelling on the roof of the assembly hall with a cistern
below.”' That dwelling appears to be Ottoman, as indicated by
the form of the semicircular-arched triple window in its south
wall (plate 15.7) and of the round-headed window in its east
wall.

 "
17,"Il SITE AND BUILDING (fig. 16.2)
","The raised terrace on which the Dome of the Rock stands is
reached by eight stairways. The date of construction of all of
these stairways is not known, butat least one and possibly several
of them must have existed when the Dome of the Rock was
built. The earliest surviving description of the Haram, written in
290/903 by Ibn al-Faqih, lists six without specifying their
positions.’ Al-Muqaddasi (c.375/985) observed that four of
them were opposite the four doors of the Dome of the Rock.”
The first detailed account is that of Nasir-i Khusraw, who visited
Jerusalem in 438/1047.3 He enumerates six stairways, one on
the east side of the terrace, one on the north side, two on the
west side, and two on the south side. Each of them had a
colonnade at the top and was called maqam, ‘holy place’.‘ The
south-eastern colonnade, Maqam Ghiri, has an inscription,
possibly not in its original place, stating that it was built in 421/
1030: and the western one bears the signature of a builder,
Ahmad b. Abi Bakr al-Banna’, and the date 340/951-52.° The
other four colonnades seen by Nasir-i Khusraw in 438/1047
were presumably built at roughly the same time as these two.
Of these six colonnades, the south-eastern one was restored in
608/1211-12,’ the north-western one was restored in 778/1376-
77 and again between 926/1519 and 974/1567,° and the
northern one was demolished, probably by the Crusaders in
the sixth/twelfth century when conventual buildings for
Augustinian canons were erected to the north of the Dome of
the Rock,’ and later replaced by two new ones, the present
north colonnade dated 721/1321 (decribed below) and the
present north-east colonnade (no. 17) dated 726/1326. The
south-west colonnade (no. 60) is a later addition, built in 877/
1472. Fig. 16.2 shows the disposition of the colonnades around
the terrace. Note that the west and north-west colonnades are at
the head of stairways built into the west side of the terrace. The
other stairways are all built against the sides of the terrace. The
reason for this difference is probably that the space between
the west side of the terrace and the west portico of the Haram
is much less than the space around the other three sides of the
terrace, and will have been considered too narrow to
accommodate stairways protruding for their full length from
the terrace.

The position of the present north colonnade, nearly on the
north — south axis of the Dome of the Rock, must be close to that
of the earlier north colonnade seen by Nasir-i Khusraw. It is
modelled on the south-east colonnade, composed of a triple-
arched arcade, supported on two columns and, at either end,
two masonry piers.

 An inscription on two marble slabs in the south-facing

(unshi‘at) in the reign of . . . Sultan al-Malik al-Nasir . . .
Muhammad... in Jumada II 721 (July 1321).!°

Further inscriptions — two on roundels under the slabs bearing
the above dating inscription and one above the crown of the
middle arch — are so badly damaged as to be almost wholly
indecipherable. A few legible traces on the right-hand roundel
suggest a paraphrase of Koran xxii, 42.""

This colonnade, like all the others, was covered with
painted plaster during the Ottoman period, perhaps during the
preparations made for the visit of the German Emperor to
Jerusalem in 1898. Later, between 1914 and 1917, the plaster
coating was removed by Jamal Pasha, commander-general of
Ottoman forces in Palestine.'”

","Situated at the top of the stairway at the south end of the
walkway leading from Bab Hitta to the Dome of the Rock
terrace, this colonnade consists of an arcade of three arches
supported by two columns and two masonry piers.*
 "
18,"Il HISTORY
","Two inscriptions on the south face of the colonnade, one on a
marble slab above the middle arch and one on two marble
slabs in the spandrels, record that:

. the pavement (baldat) of the Haram al-Sharif was

completed (takammala) and these arches (qanditir) were
built during the reign of . . . Sultan al-Malik al-Nasir . . .
Muhammad .. . That [was achieved] on 2 Rabi‘ I 726 (6
February 1326).
... this blessed pavement and the blessed arches were
completed during the superintendency of... Aydamur al-
Shuja‘'l (mamltk) of al-Malik al-Nasir, Superintendent of
the Two Harams...'

The pavement of the Haram referred to here must be that of the
Dome of the Rock terrace, the restoration of which was begun
by ‘Ala’ al-Din Aydughdi* some time before his death in 693/
1294 (see above, p. 117). As this inscription testifies, that
restoration took more than thirty years — perhaps as much as
sixty years — to complete. The present beautifully-laid
pavement of the terrace appears to belong to that restoration,
except for the part which surrounds the Dome of the Rock,
which was replaced in the 1960s.
 "
18,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","The general disposition of the colonnade, consisting of triple-
arched arcade on two columns and two end piers (see plates
17.1 and 17.2), is similar to that of the North Qanatir (no. 16)
completed five years earlier. As at the North Qanatir, the
columns with their bases and acanthus capitals are obviously in
secondary use. The piers have cyma recta cornices on the
springing line of the arcade and have upward extensions to
counteract any residual lateral thrust from the arcade. The
three pointed arches of the arcade are alike in height and span.
They are quite markedly stilted, apparently in order to match
the height of the North Qanatir by compensating for the relative
shortness of the columns in this colonnade. The voussoirs of
the arches are gadrooned on both faces and on the soffit. A
 cavetto moulding around the extradoses of the arches
continues at either end to form cornices on the pier extensions.
Four square sockets (now blocked up) in the spandrels of the
arches at the same level as the inscription above the middle
arch (see plate 17.1) appear to be putlog holes that would have
retained scaffolding during construction. On the south face
(plate 17.1) a frieze of pendent mugqarnas ‘stalactite’ corbelling
extends between the piers as a decorative canopy over the
arcade. In the corresponding position on the north face (plate
17.2) is a frieze of two tiers of shallow mugarnas corbelling.
This is the only difference in the decoration of the two faces.
Above these friezes a repeating lozenge moulding completes
the design. A gabled cornice of dressed stone above this
moulding sheds rainwater.

","On the south side of Tariq Bab al-Silsila, beside the Haram gate,
and partly over the west portico.
 "
19,"II SITE AND BUILDINGS (fig. 18.2)
","Supported by earlier substructures, the site is bounded by the
street to the north, the Haram wall (at ground floor level) and
the limit of the Haram portico (at upper floor level) to the east,
the open area beside the Wailing Wall to the south, and
unexplored buildings to the west.

The building has three floors: ground, mezzanine and
upper. The main entrance from the little square at Bab al-Silsila
leads into a vestibule, from which a door opens south into a
large madrasa, cruciform in plan, with four axial iwédns
opening on the four sides of a central vaulted courtyard. There
is a beautiful mibrab in the gibla wall of the south wan. Cross-
vaulted rooms occupy the south-east and south-west corners;
there are smaller barrel-vaulted rooms in north-east and north-
west corners. A door in the rear (west) wall of the west ivan
leads to a western annex comprising two rooms, the first of
which has two small chambers (marked ‘B’ and ‘C’ on the plan,
Jig. 18.3) opening off it. This western annex may well be based
on remains of an earlier structure.

A staircase leads from the entrance vestibule to the upper
floors. The first of these is a small mezzanine of four rooms in
the north-east corner. The main upper floor (fig. 18.5) is built
partly over the Haram portico and partly over the northern end
of the madrasa. The principal rooms are over the portico and
comprise an assembly hall to the south, a cross-vaulted room
(J) to the north of it and, further north, a council chamber (K).
Over the north end of the madrasa several smaller rooms (L-S)
are disposed around a shaft feeding light and air to the
mezzanine below.

Attached to the main building are four shops to the west of
the main entrance on Tariq Bab al-Silsila. These shops appear
to belong to the original construction, presumably intended to

19,"Ill HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

In his description of the west wall of the Haram al-Umari
wrote, when dealing with the section of the portico
immediately to the south of the Chain Gate, ‘In this portico are
two windows, whose shutters are made of ebony and ivory.
Behind them is the Tankiziyya Madrasa. The roof of the portico
bears the Tankiziyya Khanqah. At the end of that section of the
portico is a small door which gives access to the roof of the
madrasa and the living quarters of the Siifis.°
 In another passage the same author states that ‘the Sultan’s
viceroy has constructed a magnificent madrasa in the vicinity of
the ribat of al-Mansir Qalawiin (la mda jawara ribdt etc.),
which is a rather eccentric way to describe the building’s
position, but he adds an allusion to the khangah ‘overlooking
[the Haram ?] (mushrifay.’ Mujir al-Din calls the building a
madrasa ‘in the Chain Gate district, possessed of an assembly-
hall (majma‘) built over the western portico of the Haram.”
Maqrizi had referred only to ‘the khanqah’ built by Tankiz in
Jerusalem, whereas Safadi used the term ‘ribat’.? However, for
Tankiz’s ribat, see below.

The foundation inscription has been preserved and is
situated in a band above the door of the grand entrance portal.
It runs as follows:

In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate. This
blessed place was erected, in the hope of God’s reward
and His forgiveness, by his noble Excellency Sayf al-Din
Tankiz, the servant of al-Malik al-Nasir (may God forgive
him and reward him), [during the months of] the year
seven hundred and twenty-nine [1328-29].!°

The neutral ‘this blessed place’ is consonant with the multiple
functions that were planned for the foundation.

DATE

It has been recorded that Tankiz ordered the construction of ‘a
bath, a madrasa, a Hadith College and a khanqah’ in 728/1327-
28, when he visited Jerusalem on his return from a visit to
Cairo.""’ As we have seen from the inscription, the date there
given, the completion date most likely, was 729/1328-29. The
waqf document, however, was dated 12 Jumada I 730/3 March
1330 (see below).

FOUNDER

The Amir Sayf al-Din Abt Sa‘td Tankiz is too well known for a
long exposition of his career to be necessary here. He was
imported into Egypt when young by the merchant ‘Ala’ al-Din
al-Siwasi, and bought by the Amir Husam al-Din Lajin, the
future Sultan. After his death, Tankiz passed into the corps of
royal pages. One tradition, claiming to go back to Tankiz’s own
words, makes Tankiz a mamlik of al-Ashraf Khalil.

Al-Nasir Muhammad gave him an amirate of 10 before the
voluntary exile in Kerak, whither Tankiz accompanied him.
After a period of grooming for the task, Tankiz was appointed
governor of Damascus in Rabi’ II 712/August-September 1312.
His authority grew rapidly and he became the effective ruler of
 all Syria, a position he held until, for reasons that are far from
clear but in a manner that can be often paralleled, the mighty
subject fell suddenly and was arrested on the 23 Dhiil-Hija
740/20 June 1340. He was taken to Alexandria and imprisoned
there for less than a month before he was put to death — that at
least is the assumption of most sources.” Initially Tankiz was
buried in Alexandria, where Safadi appears to suggest that the
population held his tomb in honour as a hallowed spot, but at
the beginnning of Rajab 744/mid-November 1343 his corpse
was carried to Damascus and buried in his tomb chamber
there.»

The chief source for this information is Safadi,'4 who had
seen Tankiz in his days of power and also, as he claims, when
he was being put into chains on the day of his arrest. He was a
good looking man of slender build, fair with a touch of
swarthiness, with a handsome head of hair, lightly bearded and
 greying only slightly (he was at least sixty when he died). All
sources that comment on his character stress his personal
rectitude and his harsh, almost domineering ways. His ‘iron fist
controlling the amirs was welcomed by many. He was
particularly noted for the series of urban works he carried out
in Damascus, Jerusalem and elsewhere, founding religious
institutions, building caravanserais and baths and ensuring
water supplies. His great wealth and many properties, details of
which Safadi copied from official reports, were sequestered
but there is no evidence of the immediate effect his fall had on
his waqfs.'°

WAQF DOCUMENT

A copy of the wagfiyya, copied by permission of the Qadi ‘Abd
al-Halim Mustafa in 1020/1611, may be found in the Jerusalem
sijill no. 92, pp. 426-30.'° The date of the original is given as 12
 Jumada I 730/3 March 1330. The copyist has unfortunately left
out some sections of the text by mistake. The wagfiyya
describes not only the madrasa of Tankiz but also two baths !”
and the ablutions place (tabara) near them, all of which Tankiz
built and endowed. It is significant that there is no mention of
a Koran school, even though al-‘Umari associates one with
Tankiz’s charitable works and the madrasa in particular (bi-
hadratiba).""®

(i) Description of the Building

The ground floor is described as a madrasa. One enters
through double doors of walnut, brass plated. The porch is
built in white, yellow and black dressed stone with a gilded
inscription band, bearing the name of the founder. Within
there are four vaulted halls (zwvdms), of which the southern is
dedicated as a mosque (masjid) for public use.!? Owing to a
very glaring lacuna in the text, the eastern iwdn is the only
other one mentioned, with its two grille windows, opening on
to the Haram and with their shutters inlayed with ivory and
ebony.

The madrasa has a dado of coloured marble and the floor
is paved with the same material. The central octagonal pool, fed
from the conduit from ‘Arab, is mentioned, as is a kitchen, but
with no location specified for the latter. Beneath the south wall
are ‘Roman vaults’, previously known as ‘The Templars’
Stables’, access to which is by a private door in the Moroccans’
Quarter. Below the eastern wall is ‘a Solomonic vault’, which
the founder Tankiz had. restored. The latter now contains a
cistern with pipes by which the rain water is collected from the
madrasa roof. The length of the cistern is 45 [Hashimi] cubits”
and the breadth 17. The water is drawn through a grille (taqa)
in a structure (bayt) built by the founder next to his ribat for
women (see below). Within the structure is a stone basin
(jurn), the dimensions of which are 3 by 2 [Hashimi] cubits. To
the north of the vault was situated the Water-wheel Garden
enclosure (Hakiirat al-Siqdya), the site of the later Baladiyya, it
seems. The site was bounded to the west by other ‘ruined vaults
(agqba’y.

The madrasa is said to contain 22 rooms, 11 on the ground
floor for the Hanafi lawyers and 11 above for the Sifis. The
eleven rooms on the ground floor seem to include one for the
bawwab. All the rooms are vaulted and may be closed off by
their own door.

Above the main porch is a set of rooms (tabaqa), roofed in
wood and with two grilled windows looking north. Above two
of the upper floor rooms (the text is no more explicit than that)
there is a fabaqa, again roofed in wood, with windows looking
south. Access is via a staircase within the madrasa, and as for
use, they are to lodge whomsoever the administrator choses to
place there.

The range of buildings over the Haram portico which had
been erected with the permission of the Qadi of Damascus, ‘Izz
al-Din al-Muqaddisi al-Hanbali, is as follows.”’ The
southernmost room, which is called the mosque (masjid) and
is the place where the establishment of fifteen Stfis assemble
daily before dawn and after the evening prayer, has a wooden
roof carved (manjiir ?) and decorated with gold and lapis
lazuli, and walls clad in coloured marble. The mibrab in the
southern wall, has similar marble and columns. The ‘mosque’
has several iron grille-windows, nearly all of which have
double shutters, described as ‘painted Frankish’ ones (madhbun
ifranji).” There were two in the south wall and three in the east
(these all overlooking the Haram) and three others in the west
wall which was ‘built on the Haram wall’, and one more
window giving on to the roof of the madrasa (sic). Double
doors in the north wall lead into an iwdn.

The iwdain is also roofed with wood, painted with gold and
lapis lazuli, but the eastern half of the floor only is paved with
marble. Two arches built in black and white dressed stone rest
on three columns of white marble, and there is a white
{marble?] balustrade (darabzin).
 From this one moves north through a private door (bab
kbdss), decorated like the shutters above, into a chamber
(majlis), roofed as before. This room has two iron grille
windows, with double shutters, in the eastern wall. Two doors
within give access, one, to the tabaqa over the main porch, and
the other, to the roof of the madrasa.

(ii) Endowment

The village of ‘Ayn Qinya” with all its lands, situated in the
Jerusalem district west of the village of Ramallah, is specified as
the endowment's chief source of income. It is also clear that the
two baths were to provide rents for the madrasa and the other
provisions of the waqf, such as the ablutions place, and its
maintenance. The personnel and the administration of the
madrasa have been dealt with already in earlier pages (see pp.
71-72). Their pay and allowances were as follows:
 Each Sufi (including the Shaykh) received a third of a rotl
of olive oil and the same of soap each month. Any visiting Sufi
was given half a dirham and half a rotl of bread daily for a
maximum of ten days.

(iti) Women’s Ribat

The wagqfiyya gives no extended description of the ribat. It
merely says that it is ‘in the vicinity of the madrasa (al-mujawir
lil-madrasa) , and ‘built in stone with lime [mortar]’, and refers
to the inmates having to assemble for prayers ‘in one of the two
iwans of the ribat’. Some later references show, however, that
the ribat formed no part of the main complex of the madrasa.
It was situated on the other side of the little square outside the
Chain Gate.

An interesting conveyance deed, dated 953/1547,”' deals
with the purchase of the accommodation above the Chain Gate
by a member of the Ibn Jama‘a family. The boundaries are
specified as follows: south — the wall of the Tankiziyya Madrasa
and the part of the same provided as living quarters, east — the
‘air’ of the Haram, north — the Ashrafiyya Madrasa and the upper
part of the bawwdab’s house (bayt) in the Baladiyya turba, west
—the ‘air’ of the Chain Gate market place and the roof (zahr) of
the Ribat al-Nisa’, the waqf of the Tankiziyya Madrasa. In 968/
1560 the same purchaser rented a further narrow strip of the
roof of the ribat. The east boundary is defined as ‘the portico
(kharij) of the Bab al-Sakina, on which the house of the lessee
stands.”

The general position of the ribat and the fact that it
stretched some way westward are illustrated by a document
concerning the alienation of a house as waqf, dated 984/1576.
The document shows that the ribat of Tankiz formed not only
part of the eastern, but also part of the northern boundary of the
 house that itself stood to the west of the Sa‘diyya Mausoleum.”°

Tankiz's waqfiyya set out the following pay and allowances
for the inmates of the ribat:
 Each visitor was entitled to “4 dirham and % of a rotl of
bread daily for a maximum of 10 days.
 Each visitor was entitled to “4 dirham and % of a rotl of
bread daily for a maximum of 10 days.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

(i) Mamltk period

In 733/1333, only a few years after the foundation, we hear ofan
‘Ala’ al-Din b. Mansur, ‘mudarris of the Hanafis at Jerusalem in
the madrasa of Tankiz’.”’ This scholar has been identified with
‘Ali b. Ayyib b. Mansir al-Maqdisi (d. 748/1348), although this
latter was a leading Shafi‘i and one time Shaykh of the Salahiyya,
a Shafi‘T institution.” However, other Shafi‘is taught in the
Tankiziyya. Khalil b. Kaykaldi al-‘Ala’i, also a shaykh of the
Salahiyya, taught there until his death in 761/1360,?? and
another prominent Shafi‘i, Ahmad b. Hilal al-Maqdisi, the
author of Muthir al-Gharam, (d. 765/1363-64) taught there
too.*? After him until 877/1482-83 a single Hanafi family held
the headship for three generations.*!

As always, it is difficult to say how active the institution was
in this period.’ Towards the end there is an indication that the
posts in the madrasa were divided and held in fractions, a
tendency which only grew in the following Ottoman period.

The Tankiziyya makes other passing appearances in the
historical record. When Sultan Faraj visited Jerusalem during
his second reign, he resided there.*’ By the reign of Qaytbay
various tribunals were being held there. The matter of the
legality of Jewish synagogue in Jerusalem was discussed before
the Superintendent of the Two Harams, Ibn al-Nashashibi, in
878/1473-74.*4 A dispute with the Franciscans over a cemetery
in 895/1489-90 was heard in the Tankiziyya,> and by royal
command the governors of Gaza and Jerusalem held a
conciliatory session in 899/1494 before the Shaykh of Islam, Ibn
Abi Sharif, ‘in his house’ in the Tankiziyya.*° Indeed, it has been
understood from the description given by Felix Fabri that by
the time of his visit to Jerusalem in August 1483 the Tankiziyya
had become the regular seat of the Qadi of that town.”

(ii) Ottoman period

The endowment mentioned in Defter no. 52238 is much fuller
than that referred to in the wadfiyya. It is true, however, that
only one third of the village of ‘Ayn Qinya is now recorded as
waqf for the madrasa and the ribat (the annual rent being 2000
aspers). The rest of the property mentioned includes the two
baths and two tabagas above another bath ( mustahamm) at the
top of Daraj al-‘Ayn,® thirteen shops in the Cotton-merchants’
Market and near the madrasa,*° four in the Cotton-merchants’
Quarter (mahaila), nine near the madrasa and twenty-one in
Gaza. Of this last group only five are productive. In addition
there were various properties rented out on the hikr basis — the
khan near one of the baths, the roof of the ribat and some other
unspecified place near the Baladiyya, and accommodation
(tibaq) on the north side of David St., near where it leaves the
Chain Gate square.

Some accounts for repairs may be found in the Sijills. In
947/1540-41 items of expenditure included ‘clearing the
cesspits in the madrasa’ and the cost of new mats and also the
cost of transport of stones from the Maymiiniyya Madrasa.*! Was
that institution being ‘cannibalised’ to repair the Tankiziyya?
Details of estimated costs of repair works in 984/1 576-77
totalled 3489 paras.** Permission was then given ‘to give
precedence to the repair of the fabric of the waqf over the
[payment of] beneficiaries’ — something that was written into

the terms of most trusts. The elements of the building

 the south ivan’, ‘the northern closet (kbizana)’, ‘the large
eastern cell (kbalwa)’, ‘the appraisal (takbmin) of the marble
dado around the four zwdans and the replacement of the marble
that has been removed by a red paste material (?) (hamray ;®
‘the three new wooden doors of the lower eastern cells’, ‘the

of the mudarris’, ‘the northern wall of the stables (sic)’, ‘the
western apartment (ma zal) at the head of the stairs’, ‘the
middle ma zal in the middle of the staircase, to the north’, and
finally the two assembly halls (sing. majma‘), presumably the
two rooms over the Haram portico, called ‘the upper southern’
and ‘the upper northern’. These are the rooms called
respectively ‘the upper mosque’ and ‘the majlis’ in the

wagfiyya.

At some time, evidently during the nineteenth century, the
building was taken over for the town’s lawcourt (al-mahkama
al-shar iyya).“ And so it remained during the early days of the
British Mandate until it became the residence of the head of the
Supreme Muslim Council, Amin al-Husayni.**

Thereafter its history is somewhat difficult to ascertain. In
1964 the building was still described as a ‘lawcourt’,** though
only a few years later it was described as being ‘used for Islamic
conferences’.*” Historia temporis nostri semper obscurissima.
Since 1967 the building has been occupied by a detachment of
Israeli troops.**
 "
19,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","SOUTH ELEVATION

Fig. 18.9 shows the Tankiziyya as it was in 1854. There have
been few changes since. The breach in the vault of the south-
west corner room has been repaired while the southern part of
the upper storey over the Haram portico, which was in a very
poor condition then, has been demolished. The two large
windows in the south wall of that part were similar in
decorative treatment to those in the Haram facade (see below,
p. 229), which are surrounded by an elaborately modelled
frame and were surmounted by panels of ablaq joggling.

The main south elevation (excluding the upper storey
over the Haram portico) consists of three ‘storeys,’ each
constructed in a different type of masonry: large, heavily bossed
ashlars for the lowest (the substructure supporting the
madrasa); small smoother ashlars in the middle ‘storey’; and
much smaller, roughly dressed and coursed masonry at the top.

The masonry of the lowest of these storeys resembles the
distinctive masonry observed in parts of the Ayyabid halls
incorporated into the Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-Din (see above, p. 121)
where it appears to be in re-use. Here the masonry is
homogeneous and is most probably Crusader. The wall is
strengthened by two buttresses which have sloping tops — a
feature first employed in the Holy Land by the Crusaders. Three
pointed arches at the base of the wall open into a series of vaults
under the madrasa. These await detailed investigation. They
may have served to support some buildings that previously
occupied the site of the Tankiziyya. They are not part of the
great causeway which carries the street in front of the
Tankiziyya entrance across the town’s central (‘Tyropoeon’)
valley, but abut against part of that causeway, which dates from
Herodian times and of which the easternmost arch survives,
now called ‘Wilson’s Arch’,

The southern boundary and part of the western boundary
of the madrasa coincide with the boundaries of these pre-
existing substructures (see below, p. 232). The interior layout
is not related to the substructures, as the best available plan of
them (fig. 18.8), made in 1966 and based on Warren’s survey of
1868, shows.!

The two upper storeys of masonry form the south wall of
what is a single storey madrasa; the two tiers of windows light
individual rooms. The lower storey is built in the larger,
smoothly dressed ashlar and the upper one, set back slightly, is
built of smaller, less carefully dressed stones.
 WEST ELEVATION

There is no west facade as such, only the external wall of the
south-west corner room of the madrasa being exposed on this
side. This wall is structurally homogeneous with the south wall
and shares the same three ‘storeys’ of masonry. Fig. 18.9 shows
that this wall appears to abut on an earlier structure to the
north, thereby partly blocking a window.

HARAM PORTICO (fig. 18.6, plate 18.1).

The portico supporting part of the upper floor of the Tankiziyya
was built, as an inscription’ in the Haram wall testifies, in 713/
1313-14 as the second stage in the construction of the west
portico by Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad. Al-‘Umari’s description
(see above) establishes that only the first nine bays of the
portico south of Bab al-Silsila were standing in his day. The
southward continuation is a later construction, completed
some time before 1483 when Erhard Reuwich included it in his
panorama of the Haram.’ The six granite columns are no longer
in place, but it is interesting to note that the eighth pier of the
portico described by al-Umari appears to incorporate an
earlier pier which, to judge from the tooling of the stone, is
entirely Crusader (plate 12.1). The second to sixth piers are all
reinforced with sloping-topped buttresses that are evidently
later additions (see below).

 There are five openings in the Haram wall under the
portico: one door and four windows. Of these the
southernmost is the small door in the ninth (last) bay of the
portico that must correspond to the door which, according to
al-‘Umarti, ‘gives access to the roof of the madrasa and the living
quarters of the Sifis’ (see above, p. 223). It is now blocked but
presumably it opened into a staircase rising northwards within
the thickness of the Haram wall to the roof of the portico. From
there a narrow passageway spanning the corner between the
west wall of the Haram and the south wall of the madrasa (fig.
18.3) interconnects the roof of the portico with that of the
madrasa (see upper floor plan, fig. 18.5). Mujir al-Din lists the
Tankiziyya as one of those buildings that could be entered from
inside and outside the Haram.”

To the north of the door are two windows (now blocked)
that opened in the rear wall of the east Zwdan of the madrasa.
The other two windows are smaller and at a higher level. One
belongs to the north-east corner room of the madrasa, and the
other lights the entrance vestibule (see plan, fig. 18.3).

HARAM FACADE (fig. 18.6, plate 18.1)

The facade of the upper floor over the portico has undergone
several alterations. The small paired segmental-arched
windows of the northern room (marked ‘K’ on the upper floor
plan, fig. 18.5) have the appearance of having been built or
rebuilt during the Ottoman period. Their construction must,
however, have been before 1865, for an Ordnance Surve
photograph taken in that year shows the present disposition.
The same photograph shows that the southern extension of the

9
 upper floor (see above), demolished some time after 1914,>°
had a large rectangular window which matched the two
avenae windows each surrounded by a deeply moulded
frame.’ The rough patching of the masonry above the
moulded lintels of two remaining windows undoubtedly
results from the removal of a panel of joggled inlay (plate 18.2)
similar to those over the windows in the south facade (above,
p. 228, fig. 18.9).
 made in lo/g

Paired pointed-arched windows in the centre of the facade
have been partly blocked to leave rectangular openings, more
readily fitted with glazing (plate 18.3). The arches composed of
black and white ablaq voussoirs are supported by two re-used
columns and by curious elbow brackets cantilevered from a
central pier between the openings. How extensively these
windows have been altered is not clear. The wagqfiyya (see
above, p. 225) states that the arches were supported, not by two
 columns and a central pier, but by three columns. A stone in the
common spandrel between the two arches bears a repeating
trefoil motif carved in low relief that matches the pattern carved
in masonry above the lintel of a window in the Haram frontage
of the ‘Uthmaniyya (plate 57.2). Similarly decorated stones
have been re-used in the south wall of the Khatiniyya courtyard
(below, p. 346) and in the soffit of a stair window in the
Ashrafiyya. Presumably they were taken from some part of the
‘Uthmaniyya. The stone between the arches of the Tankiziyya
testifies to some not inconsiderable rebuilding of the paired
windows, perhaps during the repairs proposed in 984/1576-77
(see above, p. 228).

The arches of the first three bays of the portico south of
Bab al-Silsila also show clear signs of rebuilding (see plate
18.1). And the buttresses strengthening all the portico piers
under this part of the Tankiziyya are obviously later additions:
they extend irregularly up the facade and, at the sixth pier from
Bab al-Silsila, the buttress encroaches on the moulding around
one of the assembly hall windows.
 STREET FACADE (plate 18.4)

The striking entrance portal is the principal feature of the street
facade. The portal recess is set in a wall of finely dressed ashlars,
which abuts to the east on the Ayyibid outer porch at Bab al-
Silsila (plate 18.5). To the west, the same masonry extends a
 similar distance from the centre of the portal to create a
symmetrical composition. A cyma recta moulding extends
across the facade above the keystone of the portal. It stops
against the outer porch at Bab al-Silsila and ends abruptly a
 similar distance from the centre line of the portal to the west,
defining the limits of this symmetrical ‘portal facade’. Such a
preoccupation with symmetry seems to have been a particular
characteristic of Damascene builders during the Mamlik
period (see above, p. 85).

The western limit of the portal facade is defined by a
shallow return of 0.02m in the masonry. The lower masonry
coursing continues to the west, past this return, to include four
deep recesses opening for the whole of their width on the
street. These recesses can only have been intended for the
shops (a purpose they serve to this day, see plate 18.6)
providing income for the upkeep of the Tankiziyya (see above,
p. 228 n. 40). The symmetry of the portal facade is upset by a
recess to the east of the portal (shown blocked up in plate 18.7
but now fitted with steel doors), which lacks a proper lintel and
appears not to be part of the original construction but rather a
late insertion to serve as a small shop or stall.

Above the cyma moulding the masonry of the facade is
distinctly different, resembling that of the upper ‘storey’ of the
south and west facades. This is the facade of that part of the
upper floor which sits over the northern part of the madrasa. It
terminates 1.48m short of the outer porch at Bab al-Silsila to
leave a balcony (now fitted with a screen of iron bars) allowing
light and fresh air to penetrate the rooms to the east and south.
Of three windows in this upper facade, the west one appears to
be a later insertion (the waqfiyya mentions only two windows,
see above, p. 225) and the east one has been modified and
given a semicircular arch (plate 18.4). The jambs of the middle
window course through with the adjoining masonry and it
appears to be unmodified.
 ENTRANCE PORTAL (plate 18.7)

The portal consists of a deep recess crowned by three tiers of
mugqarnas corbelling supporting a pointed semidome that is
distinctively decorated with chevron fluting radiating from
three centres (plate 18.8).** Stone benches on each side of the
recess return on the west side (and originally also on the east
Side) across the face to the limits of the portal facade. Tankiz’s
blazon” ~a chalice on an undivided circular field — is repeated
thrice within the inscription band, once above the doorway and
once on each side of the recess. Below the inscription a panel
of joggled ablag inlay (recently repaired) decorates the back
wall over the monolithic door lintel. In a corresponding
position above the inscription band there is another panel of
curvilinear ablaq joggling, rather more elaborate than the
lower one.

The Jami’ Tankiz in Damascus, built for Tankiz in 717/
1317-18,™ has two monumental portals which closely resemble
the portal of the Tankiziyya in Jerusalem, both having three
tiers of similar muqarnas corbelling supporting a semidome
with chevron fluting. The similarities between the doorways
are so striking that there can be little doubt that the earlier
doorways in Damascus (plate 18.9) inspired the one in
Jerusalem. Indeed, despite eleven years’ difference in time
 between the two constructions, the same builders may have
been responsible for all three.
 ee eee ee ee ee ee ee ae

been responsible for all three.

GROUND FLOOR (fig. 18.3)

The entrance doorway leads into a cross-vaulted vestibule. A
deep tunnel-vaulted recess to the east of the vestibule is lit by a
window in the Haram wall (p/ate 18.10). The area to the north
of this barrel-vaulted extension, between it and the porch at
Bab al-Silsila, is inaccessible. It would appear that it was entered
from the north, and it might be connected with shops
mentioned in the notice of appointment dated 1018/1609-10
(see above, p. 228 n. 40). A grilled window that opens from this
area north on the Bab al-Silsila porch is now largely obscured
by a modern bookstall (plate 18.11).

The staircase to the mezzanine and upper floor rises
against the south wall of the vestibule. An inscription in that
wall, above the foot of the stairs (see plate 18.10), records
restorations made in the 1920s.
 The vestibule was made co-axial with the interior of the
madrasa. A door in its south wall opens in the middle of the
back wall of the north ivdin (plate 18.12). Each of the ivéins is
cross-vaulted, and the courtyard, square in plan, is roofed in a
novel fashion with a multi-faceted or ‘folded’ cross vault rising
to an octagonal oculus at the crown. Under the oculus an
octagonal stone basin” occupying the centre of the courtyard
(plate 18.13) contains a fountain in the middle and is
surrounded by a shallow trough to catch spillage. A
semicircular niche in its north side reaffirms the gibla
 orientation of the mibrab. Rainwater passing through the
oculus, or compluvium, would fall into the basin/impluvium.
Van Berchem” avers that water thus collected was piped into
the main aqueduct (restored by Tankiz) running down Tariq
Bab al-Silsila to the Haram, but this is improbable. The average
annual rainfall in Jerusalem is 560mm with a maximum
monthly average of 120mm, which means that the quantity of
water that could be collected in the basin is negligible —
scarcely enough ever to fill it, in fact. The piped connection
with the main aqueduct was really for the purpose of supplying
water to the fountain, as the wagfiyya implies (above, p. 225).
The oculus was to give light and ventilation.

The plain stone paving of the floor appears to be largely
original though the wagfiyya states that the floor was paved in
marble. Charles Wilson noted in 1865 that ‘the building appears
at one time to have been richly decorated, but now the marble
paving is fast disappearing’.*’ He must have been alluding to the
marble dado that originally ran round all the walls of the
madrasa but now remains only in the south zwdan (plate 18.13).
Some of the marble panelling from the dado has been re-used
to pave the floor of the south-east corner room (plate 18.14).
The only marble in the floor of the madrasa is in the mibrab,
where the polychrome paving is flush with the plain stone
paving of the zwan.
 The four zwans opening off the courtyard are of varying
depths, mainly as a result of restrictions imposed upon the
builders by the site. The site is limited to the east by the Haram
wall; to the south by the boundary of the pre-existing
substructure; to the west partly by the boundary of that
substructure and partly by what must be regarded as the
remains of an earlier building (AD); and to the north by the
street alignment and the southern abutment of the Ayyibid
porch at Bab al-Silsila. The south izvdn is the deepest (7.28m),
as is usually the case (but see below, p. 427), and has two
windows flanking the mibrab in the centre of its south wall.
Above the mibrab is a third, pointed-arched window. The east
iwan is only marginally less deep (6.92m) than the south one.
It has symmetrically disposed windows in its back (east) wall,
which opened under the portico. The north and west iwéans are
reduced in depth compared with the other two. The space
available for the north iwdn is restricted by the vestibule and
entrance portal, while the depth of the west zwéin is curtailed by
the pre-existing structure to the west.

This structure consisted of a group of rooms reached
 through a door in the west wall of the west zwdn. The break in
bond and the heterogeneous masonry of the two walls next to
the window of room ‘A’, visible in Salzmann’s 1854 photograph
(see fig. 18.9) but subsequently rebuilt as shown on the plan
(fig. 18.3), leave little doubt that rooms ‘A’ and ‘D’ belong to that
pre-existing structure. The large purposeless block of masonry
between room ‘A’ and the south-west corner room of the
madrasa shows that the Mamliik builders felt obliged to
maintain the regularity of the four-fwdn layout rather than
attempt to make use of this awkward corner which they must
simply have filled with rubble when they connected the
madrasa to the pre-existing structure to the west. The folded
 cross vault of room ‘A’ must surely have been built at the time
of construction of the Tankiziyya,® implying that the original
vaulting had collapsed. The octagonal recess at the crown was
originally open (see fig. 18.7). Two barrel-vaulted chambers (B
and C) in the north wall of room ‘A’ now house latrines; their
original purpose is not known. Room ‘D’ is reached through a
wide doorway in the west wall of ‘A’.

The south-west corner room of the madrasa has two doors
communicating with the adjoining iwédns, and the south-east
corner room has a door into the south ivén and a grilled
window into the east zwdn. Each has a rectangular grilled
window in its south wall, surmounted by a pointed-arched
window (see fig. 18.9). The south-west room has a similar pair
of superposed windows in its west wall. A fireplace (plate
18.15) in the south wall of the south-east room appears to be a
later refinement, added probably in the Ottoman period.

The barrel-vaulted northern corner rooms are much
smaller than the cross-vaulted southern corner rooms. The
north-east One, entered from the east iwdn, occupies the
corner between the staircase and the Haram wall. The north-
west one, entered from the west zwdn, has a grilled window
opening into the north zwdn. It is very small: its size was
restricted by the presence of the shops to the north, described
above, p. 230; the reason for its limited westerly development
is unclear.

 SETTING OUT OF THE PLAN

Thinking in terms of what the architect had to contend with on
the site, it seems that he must have prepared some sort of
 room

sketch plan, perhaps simply by pacing out the boundaries,
before work on the site commenced. Unlike Cairo, where the
Mamluk builders as often as not had virgin ground to build on,
in Mamluk Jerusalem the site was almost invariably bounded by
existing structures and was frequently strewn with the remains
of earlier buildings. A decision would need to be reached at the
outset on whether or not all or part of these remains were to be
retained and incorporated into the new building. When, as in
the case of the Tankiziyya, that new building had to conform to
a preconceived formal layout — that of a four-iwdan madrasa —
the difficulties of deciding what existing remains could be
retained while fitting the preconceived layout within the limits
of an irregular site surely could not have been overcome
without some sort of sketch plan of the site.

Having satisfactorily fitted the four-iwan plan within the
confines of the site as delineated in the sketch, the architect
could then order the levelling of the site, leaving those
structures he wished to retain. That done, the marking out of
 the foundations on the levelled site could proceed, presumably
using quicklime as was evidently customary at that time.

No sketch plans have survived from the Mamluk period,
and this suggests that such sketches were only drawn in some
impermanent way, with a stick on the ground for instance, or
with chalk on a slate which could be wiped clean afterwards.

INTERIOR DECORATION

The marble wall panelling in the south ivdn (plate 18.16)
including the mibrab (plate 18.17), is particularly noteworthy.
The lower parts of the walls of the other zzvams are set back to
a depth of 0.10m, showing that the marble dado originally ran
around all the walls of the madrasa. Marble wall panelling is
rare in Jerusalem, and the way it is treated here bears such a
close resemblance to the panelling in the Aqsa Mosque”! and in
the Haram at Hebron,” both ordered by Tankiz and completed
in 731/1330-31% and 732/1331-32"" respectively, that one can
scarely fail to conclude that all three examples are the work of
the same team of specialists. This team presumably came from
 Syria where repairs to the Great Mosque in Damacus, including
a new mibrab and marble panelling (no longer extant) were
completed on 26 Safar 729/30 December 1328.° Having
completed that work, it seems likely that this team was brought
to Jerusalem where by this time the construction of the
Tankiziyya was far enough advanced to permit the marble-
workers to begin on the interior. They were subsequently
commissioned to decorate the Aqsa Mosque and the Haram in
Hebron.

Traces of a star-pattern polychrome marble inlay in the sill
 of the west window in the south zwdn (plate 18.18) bear
sufficiently close resemblance to similar traces (plate 24.30) in
the floor of Hammam al-‘Ayn, also built by Tankiz (see below,
p. 291) to suggest that the same marble-workers were
employed there also.

In particular, the mibradb of the Tankiziyya is virtually
identical with the one in Hebron, having a band of blind
arcading® at the base surmounted by a lining of tall narrow
strips of polychrome marble, and flanked by two re-used
Crusader columns with matching capitals and bases. The
distinctive marble inlay around the conch, with interlacing
semicircular lobes on the haunches interconnecting with
geometric strapwork on the _spandrels, is, as is generally
agreed, typically North Syrian,’ and the craftsmen responsible
may have originated there. The conchs of both mibrabs are
decorated with glass mosaics, probably from stock made

originally for the restoration of the mosaics at the Great
Mosque in Damascus and partly used, as al-‘Umari states, for
decorating the gibla wall of the Jami‘ Tankiz (717/1317-18).™
The mosaicists therefore probably came from Damascus. It is
unlikely that there were expert mosaicists in Jerusalem at that
time — if there were there is no evidence of their work; the
earlier restoration of the mosaics on the Dome of the Rock
under Baybars (c.662/1264)® was probably done by
Damascene mosaicists too, ” and possibly also the restoration
under Kitbugha (695/1295-96).”

Further evidence of the splendid interior decoration of
the original building may be seen ina beautiful enamelled glass
lamp, now in the Islamic Museum on the Haram, which bears
an inscription stating that it was for the madrasa of Tankiz (bi-
rasm madrasat ... Tankiz).”

MEZZANINE (plan, fig. 18.4)

The staircase to the upper floors rises against the south wall of
the vestibule before turning south then east to the upper floor.
The mezzanine is entered directly off the staircase, without a
landing, just after the stairs turn east. It comprises four rooms
(E-H) linked to the staircase by a corridor (plate 18.19). The
door into room ‘E’ to the east of the corridor is now blocked.
Room F opens for its full width off the corridor like a small
iwdan, and room ‘G’ opposite it appears originally to have been
similar but that opening has been partly blocked to leave a
narrower door (plate 18.20). The northern room (H), entered
from the north end of the corridor (p/ate 18.21), has a small
grilled window opening north under the porch at Bab al-Silsila
(see plate 18.11). The area to the west of ‘H’ is inaccessible;
there is no sign of a blocked opening into it except for a
blocked circular window in the west face of the southern
abutment of the outer porch at Bab al-Silsila (see plate 18.5).
The other rooms (E, F and G) have no windows and are lit and
ventilated by an air shaft issuing above the north end of the
corridor.

UPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 18.5)

As we know from the nearly contemporary account of al-‘Umari
(above, p. 223), the upper floor housed the Tankiziyya
Khanqah. All the rooms at this level are vaulted, though the
wadgfiyya states that those over the Haram portico had timber
roofs (above, p. 225). This suggests that their vaulting is later,
perhaps part of the repairs authorized in 984/1576-77 (see
above, p. 228).

The khanqah may be regarded as comprising two parts: an
eastern part over the Haram portico and a western part over the
mezzanine and north end of the madrasa. The eastern part
consists of three large halls (the southernmost of which no
longer retains its original form), which would have
accommodated the communal and ritual activities of the Sifis.
The rooms in the western part are built on a smaller scale,
evidently intended for their lodgings.

The main staircase rises past the mezzanine to lead
directly into the central hall (J) over the portico. The top of the
stairs were originally sheltered by a little porch (see fig. 18.9).
Hall J, described as an wan in the wagfiyya, overlooks the
Haram through paired windows (described above, p. 229)
centred ona pier of the supporting portico. It serves as a sort of
covered courtyard interconnecting the various components of
the khanqah: a door in its west wall, beside the staircase (see
plate 18.22), leads to the western rooms (L-S); and doorways in
the north and south walls lead to the two other halls over the
portico, the council chamber (K) to the north and the assembly
hall (now partitioned) to the south.

An assembly hall (majma‘) seems to have been an
essential feature of khangahs in Jerusalem (though evidently
not elsewhere) where Sufis could perform their religious
exercises. ° This one, like those at the Dawadariyya (no. 8) and
the Is‘ardiyya (no. 33), was divided into three bays, each with a
window overlooking the Haram to the east. The southern bay
was demolished some time after 1914 (above, p. 229). The wall
 ventilated Dy an air Shalt issuing above the north end of the
corridor.

hall (now partitioned) to the south.

not elsewhere) where Stfis could perform their religious
exercises. ° This one, like those at the Dawadariyya (no. 8) and
the Is‘ardiyya (no. 33), was divided into three bays, each with a
window overlooking the Haram to the east. The southern bay
was demolished some time after 1914 (above, p. 229). The wall
 Flate 16.c2 OOUIN Wall OF TOO v
separating the northern and central bays is obviously a later
insertion, and the south wall of the central bay must have been
introduced when the southern bay was demolished. Of course,
no mibrab survives but we know from the wag@fiyya that there
was one between the two windows in the south wall (as shown
in the dotted plan reconstruction, fig. 18.5). In addition to the
windows in the east and south walls there were three windows
in the west wall and another giving on the roof of the madrasa,
according to the waqfiyya (above, p. 225). Now there are two
doors in the west wall. The secondary staircase, leading up to
the roof from under the Haram portico (see above, p. 229),
must have issued just to the south of the south-west corner of
the southern bay of the assembly hall.

To the north of hall ‘JJ is the council chamber (K), with
pointed-arched recesses in all four sides and a central folded
cross-vault. The waqfiyya seems to confuse halls ‘J’ and ‘K’ for
it has two doors opening west from ‘K’ when in reality they
open from J’. The first of these is the staircase entrance. The
second, to the north of the first (plate 18.22) leads into the
 western rooms ‘L-S’. The mezzanine air shaft forms a central
core round which the rooms above the mezzanine are
grouped. Those to the west of the air shaft are cross-vaulted (M
and N), and those to the south-east and north-east (L and O)
have folded cross vaults, while that to the east (P) is now
inaccessible, though its shallow pierced dome can be seen
from the roof (plate 18.23). This difference is for practical
reasons of lighting and ventilation. Whereas the rooms to the
west of the shaft have windows opening either on the roof of
the madrasa or on the balcony, the three rooms to the east have
no outside walls for windows. Folded cross vaults provide the
possibility of openings in the roof for lighting and ventilation.
As the plan (fig. 18.5) shows, the openings in the roof of the
three rooms vary in size and shape: a small dome (plate 18.24)
over room ‘O’ supported on an eight-sided drum with a
window in each side, pointed-arched with gadroon voussoirs
on the exterior; and a rectangular skylight covered by a hutch-
like cowl with openings to north and south (see plate 18.23)
over room ‘L’. Between these the roof of room ‘P’ has multiple
perforations mostly filled with glass — a feature usually found
only in the domes of bath-houses — which may indicate that this
room was originally a small bammdam for the use of the inmates
of the khanqah.

A corridor leads west from room ‘M’ past a barrel-vaulted
 room (Q), which has a circular window in its north wall
overlooking the balcony, to the two rooms (R and S) over the
main entrance. The first of these (R), roofed by two cross vaults,
overlooks the little square at Bab al-Silsila through a window in
its north wall, and is connected with room ‘Q’ to the east by a

15 That his family’s fortunes were not ruined utterly is suggested by the fact that
two of his sons were created amirs in 747/1346-47 (Sulitk, ii, 717). Agrandson, the
Amir Salah al-Din or Nasir al-Din Muhammad, was recorded as the ndzir of the
mosque of Tankiz in Damascus in the year 795/1393. Four years later he was
allowed to reside in Damascus with battdl status ‘because of his properties and
waqfs’, see Ibn Qadi Shuhba, i, 469 and 617.

16 Van Berchem speculated that Mujir al-Din did not allude to the wagfiyya of
Tankiz because it had perhaps been destroyed after the catastrophic fall of Tankiz
(CIA (Ville), 257, note 5). However, in 986/1578 the waqfiyya was produced before
the Qadi of Jerusalem for a reading of the conditions attached to the post of
administrator, see Sijill 58, 561 (1), and it seems to be the case that the original
dated 730/1330 was intended.

58 It is tempting to suppose that this earlier structure might originally have had
a folded cross vault and that it was the inspiration for the ones in the Tankiziyya.
But the fact is that there are several folded cross vaults in the Tankiziyya, and in
Jerusalem none is known to be earlier than them. After the completion of the
Tankiziyya almost every major Mamlik construction had a folded cross vault, and
the implication is that these vaults were modelled on the ones in the Tankiziyya.

facade of the Tomb of Kha’irbak b. Bilbay (920/1514) outside Aleppo an
unpublished mason’s sketch design for the construction of a suspended impost
(plate 18.26). Only an expert could have devised this sophisticated scheme
whereby the suspended impost is held in place by being extended upwards to
form the keystone of a segmental relieving arch. Perhaps it appeared at the time
to be over-ambitious (although there is a series of earlier suspended imposts
which still survive in Damascus and Jerusalem: see above, p. 157) for, as it happens
the ‘suspended imposts’ on the facade of this tomb are merely corbelled from the
back walls of the window recesses —a much simpler, though mundane, solution.

does include the otherwise undiscussed mihrab with a mosaic conch in the south
wall of the outer octagon of the Dome of the Rock, which appears to be work of
the sixth/twelfth century (Saladin) or seventh/thirteenth century (Baybars).

20,"I LOCATION (fig. 19.1)
","Opposite the Tankiziyya, on the north and west sides of the
square in front of Bab al-Silsila/Bab al-Sakina.
 "
20,"II SITE AND BUILDINGS (fig. 19.2)
","The site is bounded by the Bab al-Silsila/Bab al-Sakina square
and by the Sa‘diyya (no. 13) to the south, a room associated with
the Sa‘diyya to the west, the Baladiyya (no. 43) to the north, and
the northern abutment of the porch at Bab al-Sakina to the east.
The northern boundary follows the alignment of the
underlying vaults (see fig. 19.3) that carry the street across the
town’s central (‘Tyropoeon’) valley.

The plan of the building is somewhat unconventional,
with rooms opening to north and west off a corridor. The
northern rooms may predate the founding of the ribat. The
corridor is reached through an entrance portal in the south
facade, and there is a plain door leading from the square into
the western rooms. A small chamber (marked ‘P’ on the plan,
Jig. 19.3) appears to contain a well-head where water could be
drawn from a cistern provided by Tankiz.

The upper storeys are probably later additions.
 "
20,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","STREET FRONTAGE (plate 19.1).

The main feature of the unpretentious frontage on the square
at Bab al-Silsila/Bab al-Sakina is a trefoil-arched portal recess
containing the main entrance. The archivolt of the trefoil arch
is curved to form one large cavetto. Little brackets in the form
of ‘folded’ pendentives adjust the cavetto of the lowest
voussoirs to the square corners of the recess.

To the right of the entrance is a small window lighting
chamber ‘P’. Further to the right is a small door surmounted by
a window opening into the room marked ‘O’ on the plan, Jig.
19.3. This room is, as a vertical joint in the masonry shows, a
later addition. To the left of the entrance is a plain rectangular
window lighting the corridor.

The masonry of the street frontage continues round the
corner onto the west side of the square to abut on the north-
east corner of the Sa‘diyya (no. 13). In the corner is a plain
rectangular doorway surmounted by a small window which
opens into the western part of the ribat (see plate 13.5).

There are several windows in the upper part of the
frontage which light rooms on two upper floors. These upper
floors have not been surveyed. A small change in the dressing
of masonry of the frontage seems to indicate that they do not
 belong to the original foundation. A window above the mibrab
of the Baladiyya (see below, p. 449), built around 782/1380,
originally opened on the area now occupied by buildings on
the first floor and this too suggests that the upper floors are
later additions. Furthermore, the open staircase (see plate 19.2)
to the first floor rises against the wall containing the present
entrance to the Baladiyya, which appears to have been erected
not earlier than 875/1470 (see below, p. 447). It is very unlikely
that the staircase was built before that wall and consequently it
may reasonably be supposed that the first floor (on the roof of
the ground floor) was added some time after 875/1470. Since
the trefoil arched portal rises about 1.90m above the crowns of
the vaults of the ribat, the upper part of the frontage must

originally have stood as a high (approx. 1.50m) parapet wall on
the roof.

INTERIOR (plan, fig. 19.3)
The entrance portal opens into a corridor that gives access to
the various rooms of the ribat. A modern plywood lining covers

 possible to say whether or not the northern rooms (Q-V) once
opened directly on the square and were subsequently isolated
from it by the construction of the wall that forms the present
street frontage, as the notable lack of regularity in the plan
might suggest. The vaulting of the rooms is without
consistency: some have barrel vaults, others cross vaults. Uae
northern range of rooms is lit only indirectly by the windows in
the street frontage.
In the north-east corner of room ‘Q’ traces of an earlier
wall may be seen (see plan). This room has been connected to
the adjoining room ‘R’ by the demolition of the common wall.
Room ‘S’ has a window into the corridor; it is entered from
toom 'T’ to the west. Room ‘T’ (now containing a latrine) gives
access to room ‘U’, which has a window in its south wall.
 The west end of the corridor is blocked by a modern wall
of concrete blocks. Now the area to the west is reached by the
doorway at the north-west corner of the square at Bab al-Silsila/
Bab al-Sakina. The main rooms in this area are more
generously proportioned. A barrel-vaulted hall (Y) gives access
to them. The square recess at the crown of the vault of the hall
may once have been open to admit light and provide
ventilation. On the north side of the hall is the window into
room ‘U’ and two doors into a large room (V) roofed by two
cross vaults and now divided by a partition wall. A lower barrel-
vaulted recess (W) opens to the west from the hall. A small
room (X) and an wan open on the south side of the hall. There
is nothing in the present structure that corresponds obviously
with the second ivan mentioned in the wagfiyya (above, p.
 225). The area to the west of the hall may, however, originally
have formed part of the ribat, as suggested by the document
dated 984/1576 cited above (p. 225), though there is no sign of
a door from the hall into this area.

In the south-east corner of the complex is a small chamber
(P) which is no longer easily accessible. Its plan (see fig. 19.3)
was drawn from measurements taken through the high-level
window in its south wall. The original entrance from the east is
blocked by a modern concrete wall. The keeper of the
adjoining storeroom (O) informed us that one of the recesses
in its north wall contains a well-head. (The floor is now overlaid
with debris.) This must be where, according to the wadgfiyya
(above, p. 225), Tankiz built a structure housing a stone basin
and a grille through which water was drawn from a cistern
below.

 "
21,"Il SITE AND BUILDING (ig. 20.2)
","The minaret is based on a substantial block of masonry against
the east face of the Haram wall between the inner (east) porch
at Bab al-Sakina and the Ashrafiyya (no. 63). An irregular
vertical joint in the north of face of this masonry (see below, p.
598) may indicate the original eastern extent of an earlier
minaret, for Mujir al-Din states that this minaret, like others
around the Haram, was probably built on the foundations of an
earlier minaret that existed in Umayyad times.’

The present minaret, built of stone, is of the traditional
Syrian square tower type. It is now reached by way of the
entrance staircase of the Ashrafiyya.
 "
21,"Il HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION AND DATE

In the east face of the masonry base on which the minaret
stands a badly weathered inscription records that the
reconstruction of a minaret (the word used is unclear) was
ordered in the reign of the Sultan (al-Nasir Muhammad) . . .
(several words missing) in the year 730/1329-30. The missing
words probably included reference to the Amir Tankiz al-
Nasiri.? Mujir al-Din writes that the second minaret (of the
Haram) stands close to Bab al-Silsila on the west side of the
Haram. He adds that he had been told that it was built by the
Amir Tankiz, governor of Syria, when he built the madrasa (no.
18) that bears his name in the neighbourhood of Bab al-Silsila.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

In Mujir al-Din’s day it was, he says, reserved for the best
muezzins; it was from this minaret that the call to prayer was
initially sounded, so giving the signal to muezzins on other
minarets.

In a sequel to Mujir al-Din’s chronicle’ it is recorded that
the top of the minaret was damaged in an earthquake which
occurred in 902/1496 or, more probably, 952/1546. It was
subsequently repaired. Quite how extensive these repairs were
is not known, though certain irregularities in the masonry
below the corbelled gallery (see below) suggest that much of
the upper part was rebuilt. Early photographs (e.g. plates 35.5
and 63.13) show that it had been given a typical Ottoman
‘pencil-point’ spire. That spire was removed in 1894 and
replaced by a smooth ashlar drum and dome.

The lantern was further repaired in 1923-24 when the
present canopy was erected and the dome given its lead
cladding.®

EXTERIOR (plan, fig. 20.3; elevation, fig. 20.4)

The square shaft of the minaret is divided into four storeys by
string courses. The lowest storey is largely concealed by later
structures (plates 20.1 and 20.2). Only the east side is relatively
unencumbered in this way. It is quite plain apart from the
rectangular entrance door (plate 20.3). The string course
dividing this from the second storey is decorated with a cyma
recta moulding

Directly above the string course, slit windows with ogee
heads pierce the masonry of the second storey in the middle of
the south, west and east sides to light the staircase. Above these
windows are two shallow circular recesses, matched by a
similar recess in the north side. The west side is plain. If these
circular recesses were intended to contain some applied
ornament, no trace of such survives. Perhaps more likely is that
they were intended simply to relieve an otherwise blank panel
of masonry on those sides of the minaret that are visible from
within the Haram. A cavetto string course embellished with a
repeating mugarnas motif divides this storey from the third.

The third storey is more elaborately decorated with
recesses in each side containing round-headed slit windows.
Each of these recesses is spanned by three tiers of muqarnas
corbelling, five units wide on the north and south sides, and
three units wide on the east and west sides. Nook-shafts
composed of re-used Crusader columns with capitals and bases
occupy the lower part of the jambs of each recess.

The fourth storey comprises a square chamber containing
the stairhead of the minaret within a corbelled muezzin’s
gallery. This has a modern balustrade and canopy. Immediately
below the corbelling supporting the muezzin’s gallery traces
survive of a cavetto string course embellished with a repeated
mugarnas motif. Much of this string course has been replaced
with a plain string course (see plate 20.4), presumably when
the top of the minaret was repaired following the earthquake
mentioned in the sequel to Mujir al-Din’s chronicle (see
above). Since most of the original string course has been
replaced, it follows that the corbelling above has been rebuilt
or replaced also. The present composite corbels supporting
the gallery, five on each side and one at each corner, are
assembled in a somewhat makeshift fashion as if they are in
secondary use.

The muezzin’s stair emerges by a door in the south side of
the stairhead chamber, above which is an octagonal lantern
surmounted by a circular drum and bulbous stone dome now
 sheathed in lead and fitted with a crescent finial. The whole of
this uppermost part of the minaret has been rebuilt, as
evidenced by the texts cited above and by the ogee head of the
staircase door, which is late Mamlik or Ottoman in style and
probably dates from the repairs mentioned above. The
arrangement of a square chamber surrounded by a gallery and
surmounted by an octagonal lantern is similar to that found at
the Ghawanima Minaret (no. 10) and so may recall the original
arrangement. The circular drum and dome belong to the 1894
repairs, and were refurbished in 1922-23 (see above).

INTERIOR (plans, figs. 20.2 and 20.3)
The minaret is now reached from the entrance staircase of the
Ashrafiyya (see below, p.598). How it was reached originally is
 not known. The present Ashrafiyya staircase, built in 887/1482,
may replace an earlier one, though if such Gasted al-‘Umari,
writing c.745/1345, makes no mention of it.’ Alternatively, a
little staircase (now blocked) that rises from beside the tomb
chamber of the Baladiyya (see below, pp. 447 and 598) might
once have served to give access to the minaret.

A wide archway in the south side of the top landing of the
Ashrafiyya staircase opens into a barrel-vaulted passage in
which a flight of eight steps rises eastwards to an open porch
along the east side of the minaret. This passage and the frontage
of the porch, with one window opening north on the Ashrafiyya
staircase and two opening east on the Haram, were built at the
same time as the Ashrafiyya. A partition now blocks the
southern end of the porch and partly masks the entrance to the
 minaret (plate 20.3). The plain entrance door leads to a stone
spiral staircase within the core of the minaret, which rises to the
muezzin’s gallery. The ceiling of the staircase is formed by the
sinderside of the stens above. dressed with plaster (plate 20.5).

 "
22,"Il SITE AND BUILDING (fig. 21.2)
","The site of the madrasa is bounded to the east by the street and,
barely nine metres to the west, by what must be the eastern
extremity of the Antonia rock scarp.' Thus the strip of land
available for building was relatively narrow. These
topographical restrictions mean that the accommodation was
arranged on three levels. The somewhat cramped layout on
two floors behind the north wall of the Haram was
complemented by a more spacious development over the
Haram portico. It is interesting to observe that the development
over the portico was shifted eastward from the lower floors,
apparently for the aesthetic reason of creating a striking
architectural facade centred on the Bab al-‘Atm and facing
straight on to the Dome of the Rock.

The layout of the ground floor is more or less
conventional with a courtyard surrounded on three sides by
cells and a deep wan opening on the fourth, south (gibla) side.
To the east of the van is a small tunnel-vaulted tomb chamber
with a cenotaph. The first floor of the madrasa (which we
shall call the mezzanine) is reached from the courtyard by a
staircase. Continuing, this staircase serves also the
development over the portico (which we shall call the upper
floor). There is no mibrab in the Aminiyya.

The mezzanine was a new concept in the Mamlik
architecture of Jerusalem but the layout is no more unusual
than the special limitations of the site demanded. Both the
ground floor and the mezzanine have passages leading to
blocked doors which once connected with a now inaccessible
area to the north. The level of the street descends as it
approaches Bab al-‘Atm and has thus allowed the extension of
the mezzanine by an extra room over the street, just outside the
Haram gate.

At the upper floor level an entrance portal leads from a
roof courtyard at the top of the stairs into a small vestibule and
thence to a group of three rooms of differing sizes overlooking
the Haram.
 "
22,"Il HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION : e
In his description of the north side of the Haram al-Umari
wrote:

Following this gate [Gate of the Glory of the Prophets C Bab
Sharaf al-Anbivd’). the modern Bab al-‘Atm] is a portico
 forty-seven cubits in length and seven and a half in
breadth, carried on eight piers. At the beginning of it [i.e.
to the west of the gate] are two windows, one of which is
open, giving on to the zawiya of the Vizier Amin al-Din,
known as Amin al-Mulk.”

There is no inscription, but that the original designation of the
foundation was as a zdwiya gains support from Haram
document no. 191, where that term is used. Mujir al-Din in a
very short notice calls it a madrasa.*

DATE

In this same notice we are informed that ‘The Aminiyya
Madrasa at the Gate of the Glory of the Prophets, also known as
the Bab al-Duwaydariyya, was endowed by the Vizier Amin al-
Din ‘Abdallah in the year seven hundred and thirty [1329-30].
This was in the middle of a period out of office when he may
have gone to live in Jerusalem as he had done on an earlier
occasion.

FOUNDER
The founder named by the above sources was one of the
influential state officials of Coptic origin who were prominent
in the period of al-Nasir Muhammad b. Qalawin. His full name
was Amin al-Din Abt Sa‘id ‘Abdallah (also known as Amin al-
Mulk) b. Taj al-Riyasa b. al-Ghannaém. He gained his
administrative skills and experience from his uncle, al-Sadid,
the Comptroller (mustaw/fz), and succeeded him when he died.
In Rajab 700/March 1301 a campaign against the Coptic officials
was launched by Baybars the Taster (subsequently Baybars IT).
Amin al-Din went into hiding for about a month but eventuallly
re-appeared and accepted conversion to Islam.""

There is some confusion in the sources over the details of
his career, but the main lines are clear.’ Within a few years of
the return of al-Nasir Muhammad to power for the third time,
Amin al-Din began his first vizierate,° which office he held
altogether three times. After the second time he served as
Inspector (ndzir) in Tripoli but resigned and went to live in
Jerusalem with battal status and a salary of a thousand dirhams
a month.’ He was recalled to the vizierate for the last time, after
the —— of Karim al-Din (see p. 211), in Rabi’ Il 723/May
1323.8 When about sixteen months had elapsed he resigned,
because of the Pressures upon him, in favour ofa military man,
Mughultay al-Jamali. For a brief period in 728/1327-28 he was
recalled to act alongside the vizier as Inspector of State (nazir
‘al-dawla), during which time the historian and biographer, al-
Safadi, was employed by Amin al-Din to write official
 correspondence for him.° Otherwise he was free of public life
for roughly nine and a half years, towards the end of which
period, if Mujir al-Din is to be believed, he endowed his zawiya
at Jerusalem in 730/1329-30.

When in Safar 733/October 1332 Amin al-Din was
summoned to accept a package of posts in Damascus (the
Inspectorates of Syria, the Privy Purse, and the Waqfs),!! it was
al-Safadi who composed his document of appointment (taqlid)
and preserved a copy of it in the biographical notice he devoted
to him.’* Amin al-Din remained in Damascus for over seven
years until, upon the downfall of al-Nasir’s latest chief minister,
‘Abd al-Wahhab al-Nasht, in Safar 740/August 1339, he was
called to Cairo.'* The Sultan intended to restore him yet again
to the vizierate but the amount of opposition to Amin al-Din
diverted him from that, and Amin al-Din was again out of office
(battal).

When the end came, there is a hint that it was connected
with the Amir Tankiz’s tumble from power. Al-Maqrizi writes
that Amin al-Din was arrested and put to torture because he was
suspected of being of Tankiz’s party.'* His seven recent years in
Damascus had surely made him a close professional associate
of the all-powerful governor of Syria, and al-Safadi says plainly
that the Amir Tankiz liked him very much.!> Tankiz was
arrested at the end of 740/JJUune 1340 and was dead within about
a month (see p. 224). If there was a connection with the arrest
of Amin al-Din, then there are difficulties about the year 740
being given for the latter’s death.'° Al-Maqrizi writes that Amin
al-Din died under torture in Jumada I 741/October 1340,'7
which would fit better chronologically.
 His two sons who shared in their father’s fall managed to
re-establish their own careers. Karim al-Din served as
Inspector of the Household Departments (ndzir al-buyit),'®
but the more influential was Taj al-Din Ahmad’? who was
Inspector of the Army and then Inspector of the Privy Purse
under the Sultan al-Salih Salih”° and was closely associated with
the Amir Taz (see pp. 399-401). On the accession of al-Nasir
Hasan he reaped the harvest of his previous differences with
the Amirs Shaykhu and Sarghitmish and of the general hatred
he had gained because of his severe pruning of the
administration and cutting of salaries. Once again the fortunes
of the family and its associates collapsed. His house was
demolished and his property sold. What happened to Karim al-
Din is not told, but Taj al-Din, like his father, was tortured to
death in Shawwal 755/October 1354.”

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

What effect these successive disasters had on the foundation in
Jerusalem can only be guessed at. The Haram document
already alluded to, which is dated 13 Muharram 784/29 March
1382,” records the name of the then nazir of the zawiya, the
Shaykh Jamal al-Din ‘Abdallah b. ‘Abd al-Rahman b. ‘Abd al-
Rahim al-Halabi and the fact that he agreed to receive his salary
from the Qadi of Nablus, namely, a share of the rent from
orchards in Nablus otherwise dispensed to the Mosque of
Mercy.” The Defter no. 522 contains a note that all the waqfs of
the Aminiyya Madrasa (sic) had disappeared.”4 An account for
repairs carried out with the permission of the Maliki Qadi, and
at a cost of 320 paras, nowhere mentions that this is from waqf
 funds.”? However, other necessary works twenty-one years
later by the Qadi of Jerusalem Muhyi al-Din b. ‘Abd al-Qadir,
who was also n@zir of the ‘madrasa’ — and lived there? — were
done at his own expense, although he was to recover his
expenses from the waqf.”> How and from where is not made
clear.

It is no surprise that such references as have come to our
notice in the Jerusalem sijills make it quite clear that the
Aminiyya had lost any institutional role and had become a
Private dwelling, although still called ‘madrasa’. Even in the last
years of the fourteenth century the Sultan visited the Shaykh
Abi Bakr b. ‘Ali al-Shaybani al-Mawsili ‘in his house in the
Aminiyya’.”’ The Court entries include the inventory of the
effects of a woman who died there,” and the report of an
 incident in which two men, who had been let in one night by a
‘tall, white slave girl’ after some discreet knocking, were
arrested by the watch when a disturbance began. One was
arrested in ‘the madrasa, the residence of....—the name would
appear to be Kilabi Celebi, the haras bashi (officer of the
watch) (?!) — and the other after he had first fled on to the roof
of the Is‘ardiyya.”

Finally, in Sha‘ban 1027/August 1617, Yusuf b. Radi al-Din
b. Abi al-Lutf succeeded his brother in half of the positions of
shaykh and bawwab in the zawiya (sic). His uncle held the other
half. The empty formality of this is suggested by the fact that the
return for the exercise of these functions was the right to reside

there.
In time the ‘madrasa’ was made a waqdf for the al-Imam al-
 Husayni family. Many generations have lived there, and
members of the family are buried in the ground floor
chamber.! The buildings are at present (1984) lived in by the
Qadi As‘ad al-Imam al-Husaynt, former judge of Ramallah.
 "
22,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","HARAM FAGADE (fig. 21.6, plate 21.1)

The ground floor frontage is now concealed behind the Haram
portico which was blocked up some time in the Ottoman
period to provide classrooms for a later madrasa (called the
As‘adiyya) founded by an ancestor of Shaykh As‘ad al-Imam, the
present householder. Under the portico the original frontage
can be seen to be just as al-‘Umari describes it: ‘two windows,
one of them open...” The first window, belonging to the
tomb chamber, is the larger and is closed with an iron grille.
The second one opens as a door into the zwvén (shown in
section, fig. 21.7). Apart from these two openings the frontage
under the portico is featureless (plate 21.5).

In contrast, the upper facade over the portico is elaborate.
There are five windows disposed symmetrically about a vertical
axis which is aligned almost centrally on Bab al-‘Atm. The
middle windows are arranged as a group of three and the outer
windows are set in pointed-arched recesses on either side. The
left-hand (westernmost) window had been converted into a
door which now serves as the main entrance to the upper floors
(shown in section, fig. 21.7). A clumsy staircase, added some
time before 1865,° obstructs two bays of the portico as it rises
from the Haram esplanade to this upper entrance. The
supporting structures of the staircase incorporate a plain
mibrab belonging to the As‘adiyya.

Originally both the outer windows on the upper facade
were identical. Their essential features are preserved better
over the right-hand (eastern) window: a white marble lintel
surmounted by a limestone relieving lintel carved to receive an
ornamental inlay of imitation voussoirs (which has
disappeared) and, above, a bevelled oculus which pierces the
tympanum of the arched recess (plate 21.2).

The fine triple-arched window in the centre of the facade
has recently been restored. The central arch is greater in span
and height than the flanking ones; all three are constructed in
ablag of alternately red and cream-coloured voussoirs. They
are supported on six marble columns, recently disengaged
from secondary masonry additions around the windows (see
plates 21.1 and 21.2). The paired columns at either side of the
windows have double capitals decorated with stylized
acanthus; the single columns supporting the central arch have
‘thick leaf capitals. Both types of capital appear to be re-used
Crusader pieces.

The original height of the western part of the facade is
defined by the line of a billet moulding, some stones of which
have been re-used to outline the vertical side of a late

construction above it. The wall over the central and eastern part
of the facade is a modern parapet.
 Since the buildings to the east and west of the Aminiyya —
the Basitiyya Madrasa (no. 53) and the Farisiyya Madrasa (no.
30) respectively — are later, that part of the Aminiyya built over
the Haram portico must initially have been freestanding over
Bab al-‘Atm. Vertical masonry joints at the extremities of the
facade indicate its original extent, which corresponds to three
bays of the portico below.

STREET FRONTAGE

This is merely a wall partly concealed by the later vaulting
alluded to previously (pp. 157 and 302) which on this side of
the street is supported by buttresses. There is a humble
entrance door devoid of ornament (plate 21.3) and a narrow
window at ground floor level, and another three windows at
mezzanine level. This utter plainness demonstrates the
importance accorded to the Haram facade in marked contrast
to the adjacent Dawadariyya Khangah (no. 8) where the main
facade is on the street and the Haram facade was restricted, as
we have shown, to an insignificant frontage under the portico.

GROUND FLOOR (plan, fig. 21.3)

The entrance from Tariq Bab al-‘Atm leads into a vestibule with
doors now opening in all directions: south into the tomb
chamber, west into the zvdén and north into a short passage
connecting with the central courtyard. Of these doors, one, the
western, is not original; as the coarseness of its construction
shows, it is merely a later breach in the wall to allow direct
access to the iwéin. Likewise a later opening is the door in the
north wall of the passage. In other words, the vestibule was
originally part of a bent entrance to the courtyard. A large
semicircular window above the door into the courtyard (plate
21.4) was to admit light from the courtyard into the passage and
vestibule. Originally the courtyard was open to the sky. It has
 subsequently been covered with a lime concrete slab at the
upper level to provide a backyard for rooms added to the north
of the development over the Haram portico. As a result the
interior of the madrasa is now very dark.

A sunken basin 1.03m square, presumably intended to
hold rainwater, occupies the centre of the courtyard. The
disposition of the cells and staircase around the courtyard is
shown on the plan (fig. 21.3). The doors in the east and west
walls are arranged more or less symmetrically at the corners.
The fact that the door at the south-west corner is not exactly
opposite the one at the south-east corner must be taken as
another indication of the existence of the rock scarp there. The
door in the north wall is placed axially, opposite the zwan.

Not directly accessible from the courtyard are a cell in the
north-west corner and a passageway in the north-east corner of
the complex. The door of the north-western cell is placed
awkwardly in juxtaposition with the winders at the foot of the
staircase. The entrance to the passageway is from the cell at the
north-eastern corner of the courtyard. This passageway led
north, but it is blocked now, rendering the area to the north
inaccessible.

The zwéin, two steps up from the courtyard, is partly cross-
vaulted and partly barrel-vaulted. It extends south to the Haram
wall where the small window mentioned by al-‘Umari (above,
p. 249) opens into the portico. This window, despite its
comparatively high sill (see section, fig. 21.7), serves as a door
and must have done so since at least the end of the ninth/
fifteenth century when Mujir al-Din* lists the Aminiyya as
having direct access to the Haram.

On the west side of the zvdn there is a narrow unlit cell,
and on the east side an opening into the tomb chamber. The
tomb chamber has only the indication of a burial, a flat stone
cenotaph. At the large grilled window in its south wall those
entering and leaving the Haram at Bab al-‘Atm might invoke a
blessing on the tomb, according to Muslim custom. A recess in
the east wall extending into the vault (plate 21.6), together with
the relative thinness of the wall at that spot, indicates that there
could originally also have been a window on the street, as is the
case at the Awhadiyya Turba (above, p. 168).

MEZZANINE (fig. 21.4)
The mezzanine is entered directly off the main staircase; there
is no landing.

The complex arrangement of rooms and passages is best
understood by consulting the plan (fig. 21.4) and section (fig.
21.7). The upper extension of the central courtyard functioned
at this level as a lightwell into which open four splayed
windows, one in each side. The corners are built up on
segmental squinches (the south-east squinch is shown in plate
21.4) giving it an octagonal shape in plan. The south-west
corner of the octagon accommodates the entrance to a narrow
corridor over the staircase. It extends northwards as far as a
blocked door. The area to the north beyond this blocked door
is inaccessible, as is the area to the west since a door in the west
wall of the corridor is also blocked.

There is a wider passage parallel with the east wall of the
lightwell, which extends northwards and gives access to a short
corridor and a pair of tiny, low cells marked ‘E’ and ‘F north of
the lightwell and, beyond these, to two rooms (G and H) with
an interconnecting passage. This area to the north of the
lightwell shows signs of having been remodelled at some stage.
Aset of wooden steps in the north-western room leads up to the
backyard of later dwellings built over the mezzanine.

The mezzanine level was originally well provided with
daylight illumination and ventilation in spite of the labyrinthine
maze of rooms and interconnecting passages. The later vaulting
over the street and the covering of the lightwell has almost
completely shut out the light, however, and now the whole
floor is shrouded in sepulchral gloom. In these conditions it is
tempting to believe that the narrow cross-vaulted chamber at
the centre of the south wall, marked ‘B’ on the plan (fig. 21.4),
was a sealed burial chamber, as the present tenant of the
 building suggests. Strangely, the only access into the chamber
is a breach in the upper part of its north wall, which has the
appearance of having been made relatively recently. Half full of

earth and debris, there is, however, no obvious sign of a burial
in it
 To the east and west of this ‘burial chamber’ there are
larger cross-vaulted rooms in the south-east (C).and south-west
(A) corners of the mezzanine, each with a recess cut into its
south wall, which is the north wall of the Haram. The horseshoe
arch of the doorway (plate 21.7) into the south-western room
(A) is particularly interesting. It is largely re-used, as the vertical
joint in the masonry to the left indicates. But the asymmetrical
 profile and the variation in the stone dressing shows that only
the left-hand spandrel and voussoirs, the keystone, and
possibly one of the right-hand voussoirs are in secondary use.
The remainder appears to have been newly cut — following a
slightly different curve — to fit the re-used arch into the
adjoining structure. This is the only horseshoe arch within the
complex.

There is an unexpectedly spacious cross-vaulted room (D)
immediately to the east of the south-east corner room. This
room is supported on a vault spanning the street below: an
ingenious way of extending the otherwise restricted
accommodation at this level. It has two windows, one in the
north wall overlooking the street (p/ate 21.8) and one in the
south wall looking onto the Haram from under the portico at
Bab al-‘Atm. This latter window has been made by removing
several stones from the upper structure of the gate itself, as may
be seen in plate 21.9 and fig. 21.10.
 UPPER FLOOR (fig. 21.5)

The main staircase originally continued straight to an open
courtyard on the roof of the mezzanine, of which the northern
part has not been surveyed. Later constructions at the southern
end abutting the upper part of the Haram wall blocked the final
ten steps and necessitated their realignment eastwards to reach
the entrance to the upper rooms of the Aminiyya at what is now
the south-east corner of the courtyard.

The group of later constructions against the Haram wall
includes in the centre a vestibule built in front of the original
entrance to the upper floor of the Aminiyya. This entrance was
hewn out of the Haram wall with sufficient expertise to form a
simple portal with a cloister vault (see fig. 21.5), now coated
with plaster. Stone benches flank the doorway, which leads
 directly into a small vestibule. A door in the south wall of the
vestibule opens into the westernmost of the three rooms over
the portico. The original folded cross vault of this western
room survives: the first to be built in Jerusalem after the
Tankiziyya (see above, p. 231). The window in the south wall
has been converted into a door which now serves as the main
entrance to the upper floor (see above, p. 252).

The small, original, vestibule appears once to have given
access also to the principal upper floor room to the east, but
that access has been blocked and replaced by a more recent
door in the east wall of the western room. The principal room
is square in plan and commands a magnificent view of the
Haram through its triple window. There is a small window high
up in the north wall of this room (plate 21.9) evidently above
 the height of the Haram wall. It appears not to be original; it was
introduced as part of an apparently later development to the
north, above the room spanning the street just outside Bab al-
‘Aum (see fig. 8.4). The domical vault of the principal room also
appears not to be original; the unusually large mugarnas
plaster decoration of the pendentives is Ottoman in style. This
 must be the dome mentioned below (p. 257 n. 25) that was
repaired inside and out in 963/1556. Similarly the domical vault
in the eastern room, decorated with a muqarnas frieze in
plaster, appears also to be the result of a later rebuilding,
Loe following the earthquake of 952/1546 (see above,
p. 41).
 ON Oe

1 Although the eastern extremity of the rock scarp is not visible in the Aminiyya,
the line of the rock surface can be traced in the rear wall of the portico under the
Almalikiyya and the Farisiyya where, significantly, there are no rooms at ground
floor level. By extrapolation we can establish that the rock surface, if it continued
in a reasonably straight line, would originally have been a metre or two above the
ground floor level of the Aminiyya.

23,"Il SITE AND BUILDINGS (fig. 22.2)*
","The site of the Fakhriyya is now occupied by various ruinous
structures and a small columned hall, now the office of the
Director of the Islamic Museum. The present entrance is from
an adjoining Crusader structure to the south; the original main
entrance situated just inside the Haram gate called Bab al-
Maghariba is now closed. Van Berchem, who entered in 1914,
says that that entrance ‘gives access, by way of a dark vestibule,
to a small courtyard enclosed by lodgings. It extends
southwards into a second courtyard, planted with beautiful
cypresses and at the bottom of which stands a small oratory.
This chapel, open to the north, abuts to the west against the
Haram wall, to the east against the south-west angle of the
Maghribi Mosque and to the south against the north-west angle
of the Women’s Mosque.” This ‘oratory’ or ‘chapel’ is all that
survives now apart from the closed entrance and afew remains
of the lodgings seen by van Berchem. A high wall divides the
courtyards from east to west and we were not permitted to
examine closely the area beyond this wall where van Berchem
passed a dark vestibule and lodgings.

The evolution of this site, complicated even by Jerusalem
standards, is discussed below. Of the Fakhriyya little remains
save for its south, gibla wall together with a fine marble mibrab
and remains of a marble pavement.

The literary sources (discussed below) which make the
location and identification of the Fakhriyya clear, as usual do
not give precise details of the internal layout. However, Mujir
al-Din mentions an assembly hall (majma‘) belonging to the
Fakhriyya and this seems to have been located in the western
part of the adjoining Crusader structure to the south.
 "
23,"Il HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

The Fakhriyya, which, as will be seen, was called at various
times zawiya, khanqah or madrasa, is situated in the south-west
corner of the Haram. Al-‘Umari dealt with it in connection with
the south wall of the Haram, perhaps because the Fakhriyya had
a north facing door, whereas Mujir al-Din, more
understandably, considered it to belong to the west wall. If you
enter via the Moroccans’ Gate, ‘The first thing you meet with on
this [south] wall to the west is a mastaba, which, from the
mibrab northwards, measures six dhira‘, and is six and a half
 wide... To the east of this comes the entrance to the Fakhriyya
Zawiya ...’ These are al-‘Umari’s words.” He also makes it clear
that the Fakhriyya occupied the space within the wall of the
Haram to the west of the Moroccans’ Mosque.

Mujir al-Din writes: ‘As for the madrasas adjacent to the
wall of the Haram on the west side, which we shall mention in
order, the first is the Fakhriyya Khanqah. It is next to the
Moroccans’ Mosque, where the Malikis pray, to the west of it,
and within the wall of the Haram, as is also its entrance, near the
gate that leads out into the Moroccans’ Quarter.”

DATE
There is no foundation inscription and the date of the original
wagdfiyya is not recorded. The founder died in Rajab 732/April
1392:

Fakhr al-Din is known to have visited Jerusalem. A son of
his, who died in 714/1314, had taken over administrative
responsibilities ‘while his father was absent in Jerusalem’. In
716/1316 he came to the city with the Chief Qadi Badr al-Din
Muhammad b. Jama‘a, and came once more in 723/1323.4
Whether it was during one of these visits that he began his
building we have no way of telling.

FOUNDER
The continuation of Mujir al-Din’s text identifies the founder:

The building was built and endowed by his exalted
Excellency the Qadi Fakhr al-Din Aba ‘Abdallah
Muhammad b. Fadl Allah, the Inspector of the Army. He
was born a Copt, but converted and became a good
Muslim. He made many waqfs and was charitable and
generous towards the men of religious learning. He was a
great and honoured state official. He died in the middle of
Rajab 732 [12 April 1332], over seventy years of age.

Fakhr al-Din was one of the great officials of al-Nasir
Muhammad.’ His uncle was Sharaf al-Din b. Zunbir, another
high official. Fakhr al-Din was a devout person in both the
Christian and the Muslim phases of his life. When pressure was
being brought on him to convert, he contemplated suicide
until, after a period of retreat, he reconciled himself to the
necessity. He adopted the Hanafi school of law (madbhab), is
Said to have eschewed all contact with Christians and to have
taken his Islam seriously.

He began his administrative career as clerk of the
mamliks and was transferred to the Army Bureau in Shawwal
 709/March 1310, early in al-Nasir’s third and final reign.° He fell
prey to the common internal rivalries and was dismissed for a
month or so in 712/1312, during which time some 400,000
dirhams were taken from him. On his return to office’ this was
all restored to him, but he tactfully used it to build a mosque in
Cairo in the name of the sultan. He is associated with the two
cadastral surveys, in Egypt and Syria, undertaken during al-
Nasir's reign. His high standing in the state and his personal
boldness of speech with the sultan lasted till his death in office.
His role in the control of affairs had increased greatly after the
death of Karim al-Din (see p. 212) and after he had persuaded
the sultan not to appoint a vizier to succeed Mughultay alJamalt
(729/1328-29). From his position as head of the Army Bureau
Fakhr al-Din’s influence was ubiquitous.

Before his death on Sunday, 15 Rajab 732/12 April 1332, he
 made an attempt to avoid the likely plundering of his estate by
bequeathing to the sultan a large sum of money. Nevertheless,
a mamlik of his, Lu’lu’, was forced to provide a full list of his
master’s possessions, commodities of trade and real estate in
Egypt and Syria, including some in the Jerusalem district,
whether they had been made wagf or not. Sequestration orders
went out, but in one version it is said that his wagfs were not
touched.®

Fakhr al-Din’s charitable foundations were numerous.
The Market of Fakhr al-Din (Siig al-Fakbr) in Jerusalem, where
Mujir al-Din says that there were soap-works,? was his, and a
madrasa at Nablus and a hospital at Ramla are mentioned, as are
several drinking troughs (abwdd) along the main roads. In
Egypt he built three mosques, on the Nile at Mawridat al-Buri,
on Elephant Island and on Roda opposite the outlet ofal-Nasir’s
 canal.!° The Fakhriyya Madrasa in Hebron, which had been
abandoned by Mujir al-Din’s time, was according to him
‘apparently to be attributed to the founder of the Fakhriyya in
Jerusalem, but God knows best.’

ENDOWMENT

The date of the original instrument of endowment is not
recorded, Two Ottoman land registers’? give the date of a
document which would have reaffirmed the purposes and
conditions of the foundation, perhaps after the loss of the
original document. The date is 903/1497-98. In the same
registers the details of the property and the income are
recorded in the following manner:

NE Se ae
 These properties are mentioned throughout the
Jerusalem Court records in various rent and ‘farm’ contracts.
The properties from which the Fakhriyya drew rents, situated
within the old city, are more particularly described as: two soap
factories (presumably in the Market of Fakhr al-Din, see above,
p. 259), a dar al-khawkba (?), a vaulted room (qabw), a garden,
and ‘the cells, [rooms over] the arch and passage, and outer
house (al-dar al-barraniyya) adjoining the aforementioned
khanqah on the west’.'°

OTTOMAN PERIOD

Kamil Asali states'® that Fakhr al-Din’s foundation in Jerusalem
was originally built as a madrasa, and that the transformation
into a Sufi khanqah seems to have been completed after the
tenth/sixteenth century. Apart from the fact that the
terminological and functional distinction was never so exact, al-
‘Umari refers to the building as the Fakhriyya Zawiya towards
the middle of the eighth/fourteenth century and Mujir al-Din
calls it a khanqah at the very beginning of the tenth/sixteenth
century. Both Tahrir registers, which date from the second half
of this latter century, head their entry ‘the waqf of the Fakhriyya
Khanqah’, but then refer once to ‘the madrasa’. The Jerusalem
sijills also alternate between ‘madrasa’ and ‘khangah’ when
dealing with the Fakhriyya.

Most of the sijill entries are connected with leasing the
wadf lands. For example, in 962/1555 a qadi leased some of the
Qamra land from the overseer for fifty years for 1000 paras.’ In
984/1576, a mugqata a contract, that is a farm ofall the revenues,
for a period of four years, was negotiated on payment of 120
gold pieces (30 annually).’®

Two other entries deserve mention. An order was made in
937/1530 to unblock a door leading to an ablutions place at the
Moroccans’ Gate, over which the Fakhriyya was said to be
constructed. This gate had been illegally closed, because of the
smells the place occasioned, by the late Qadi ‘Abd al-Rahman
Muhammad al-‘Ulaymi, who had resided in the madrasa.!? At
the end of 963/autumn 1556 certain repairs to the Fakhriyya
 were contracted for at the cost of 45 gold pieces to cover
materials and labour. The details of the repairs are not easy to
follow but they mention a length of the western wall (17%
cubits), the vaulting (aqd) of the ruined house adjoining that
wall, the vaulting of ‘the cell, the old door of which has now
been blocked and a new one opened’, the open court (saa) on
the west side, the vaulting of ‘the western cell which is
alongside the house’, ‘the upper room which is in the top house
(al-dar al-‘@liya), the cells of the madrasa and the passage
(dibliz) of the ablutions place’.”°

Members of the Abi al-Su‘tid family lived in the Fakhriyya
for several centuries down to recent times. The buildings
became their direct property. Asali has suggested that the year
984/1576-77 was the beginning of their connection with the
Fakhriyya but, dating from their taking on the office of overseer,
the connection can be put back some twenty years.”
 "
23,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","EARLIER CONSTRUCTIONS

To understand the Mamlik phase in the complex development
of the site it is necessary first to attempt to determine the extent
of earlier structures around it.

(i) Great Hall of the Templars

Along the south end of the Haram between the south-west
corner and the Aqsa Mosque stands a long two-aisled hall
roofed by twenty cross vaults supported on a central row of
nine piers. The distinctively dressed masonry of the north wall
of the hall, bearing several masons’ marks, shows it to be
Crusader. This hall must be the monastic quarters of the
Templar Order built probably in the 1160s” and described by
Theodorich in 1170.” The eastern part of it was converted into
the Women’s Mosque, evidently shortly after Saladin’s
conquest of the city. The western part became an assembly hall
for the Fakhriyya.

A more or less regular series of openings pierce both the
north and south walls of the hall; all those in the south wall
remain open but of those in the north wall (fig. 22.2) only three
are still open: one at the east end, one in the centre (which
serves as an entrance to the Women’s Mosque) and one
towards the west end, which was blocked by the mibrab (plate
22.1) of the former Maghribi Mosque, but re-opened to link the
 two parts of the Islamic Museum. At the west end the structure
changes somewhat. The south-western bay had a pointed ar ch
in its south wall clearly visible in the exterior masonry of the
Haram wall. It is hard to imagine what the purpose of this arch
might have been for it is blocked by masonry similar to that of
the rest of the south and west walls and contains a grilled
window virtually identical to others that are obviously original.
Since the arch and the masonry blocking it appear to be
contemporaneous, one can only guess that it was intended
somehow to facilitate construction of this corner of the
 building, though quite how it could have done so is a mystery.
Opposite that arch, at the west end of the north wall of the hall,
there is a similar arch which was originally open. It is now
blocked by the gib/a wall of the Fakhriyya.

(ii) Vaulting springers

In the north face of the north wall of the Templar Hall (fig. 22.2)
are a series of springers apparently intended as the southern
abutments of a series of vaults. The springers are well
integrated into the masonry of the wall and appear almost as if
they were built along with it. There are, however, indications
that they are in fact later insertions. For instance, while the
springers are spaced exactly half as far apart as the springings of
the Templar Hall vaults, they are not symmetrical with them as
would be expected if they were built simultaneously. As a result
several springers impinge awkwardly on the lintels over
openings in the north wall of the Hall (see figs. 22.3 and 22.7).
It would appear, therefore, that the springers were inserted
after the Hall was built, perhaps to support the vaults of a
portico or cloister. No other trace of such a cloister exists and
it is likely that the work was interrupted, possibly by Saladin’s
capture of Jerusalem, never to be completed.

(iti) Ayyitbid halls

Extending northwards from the two westernmost bays of the
Templar Hall were two long halls roofed by barrel vaults with
 various excisions to clear openings in the supporting walls.
Only the eastern hall survives; the Fakhriyya was constructed
on the site of the western one. The articulation of the south-east
corner (marked ‘A’ on the plan, fig. 22.3) of the eastern hall so
as to avoid blocking one of the windows of the Templar Hall on
which it abuts shows that these walls were built some time after
the Templar Hall. The re-use of one of the springers (marked
‘B’ on the plan) discussed in section (#) for the vaulting at the
south end of the eastern hall confirms that the construction of
this hall was subsequent also to the springers. Since the
masonry of these later halls bears no coherent evidence of
Crusader tooling or masons’ marks, they are likely to be post-
Crusader, probably Ayyiibid.”4

The eastern hall initially opened to the east in a series of
arches of which the southern three and a springing of a fourth
as well as the northernmost one are still discernible (see fig.
12.2, fold-out at back). They have been filled in to leave in the
centre of each a rectangular window surmounted by a slit. This
may have been done when the eastern hall was consecrated as
a mosque for North Africans, known as the Jami‘ al-Maghariba,”’
probably in about 590/1194 when Saladin’s son, al-Malik al-
Afdal, endowed the neighbouring town quarter in favour of the
Maghribi community in Jerusalem.”° About the middle of the
eastern wall a new entrance facade (see fig. 12.2, fold-out) was
 erected in 1288/1871, partially obscuring the arched frontage of
the original hall.’’ At the same time the vaulting was altered to
provide a domed bay immediately inside the new entrance.”
This eastern hall, together with the western part of the Templar
Hall, was converted into the Islamic Museum in 1927.”

Of the western hall little remains except for traces of
vaulting in the spine wall between the two halls (see below).

These Ayyubid halls extended north to within 6.5m of the
Bab al-Maghariba. Their north facade survives (fig. 22.4, plate
22.2). It consists of two pointed-arched doorways placed more
or less symmetrically on either side of the central axis. The
doorways are built largely of re-used Crusader elements
including hoodmoulds and (on the left-hand doorway) elbow
brackets supporting a lintel (plate 22.3). Both doorways have
 undergone subsequent alterations. The tympanum of the left
one is blocked save for three small windows; the tympanum of
the right one is still open but its right-hand jamb is masked by
a pier of the western portico of the Haram (erected some time
between 745/1345 and 887/1482), and a pointed arch (also
composed of re-used Crusader elements) containing a smaller
door has been built into the original doorway. A mibrab,
probably late Mamluk or early Ottoman to judge by the small

circular inscription above it2° has been placed centrally
between the two doorways.
 The left doorway opened into the Jami’ al-Maghariba, the
right one into the Fakhriyya. This is how al-‘Umari described it:

(The south wall of the Haram) begins on the west side with
a raised platform... in front is a mibrab [no longer extant],
next to it on its eastern side is the door of the Fakhriyya
Zawiya ... which is followed by a raised platform next to
which is the door of Jami‘ al-Maghariba ... the length of the
porch [in front of this facade] is 11% dhira‘ (approx.
8.16m)..

The porch mentioned by al-‘Umari survived until the 1920s
when it was demolished. It is clearly visible in early
photographs (plate 22.4).

 IE PAK LA

1) Site

The right-hand (western) doorway in the north wall of the
\yyuibid halls led, as al-‘Umari states, into the Fakhriyya. Access
o the area immediately beyond that door is restricted
10wadays; we have only van Berchem’s description (above, p.
258) as a guide to the northern part of it. The southern part is
entered by a door from the Templar Hall, now part of the
slamic Museum, to the south. That door (marked ‘C’ on the
lan, fig. 22.3) leads into the columned hall (van Berchem’s
oratory’), described below, which opened to the north
hrough two archways. These archways have been blocked up
o leave two round-headed windows in the west one anda door
surmounted by a window in the east one. Now only the door
‘emains open (see plate 22.5). To the north, beyond the
 columned hall, is an open yard enclosed by a low wall (the
upper part of the Haram wall) on its west side, by a relatively
modern partition wall to the north (plate 22.8), and to the east
by the spine wall that originally divided the two Ayyabid halls.
 There are several openings in this spine wall, all blocked up*
save for one, reached by an open flight of eight steps, that gives
access to the roof by way of a staircase in the thickness of the
wall (see fig. 22.3). Traces of springers and voussoirs
protruding from the spine wall (plate 22.5) indicate that this
area was once vaulted. The uniform north facade of the two
halls (described above) suggests that the vaulting of this
western hall was contemporaneous with and extended
alongside the eastern Ayybid hall. The lateral thrust of the
vault must have contributed to its collapse, perhaps during an
earthquake. Subsequent rebuilding on the site can be traced in
the masonry of the Haram wall.
 (ti) Haram Wall (plate 22.6; fig. 22.5)

The stretch of Haram wall from the south-west corner to the
Bab al-Maghariba is in its present form the result of untold
building operations over the years, as the intricate mosaic of
different masonries testifies. By isolating individual
components of this mural mosaic, rather in the way an
archaeologist might analyse the stratigraphy of an excavated
trench, we can establish the relative phases of construction and
so comprehend better the state of the site when the Fakhriyya
was founded.

Our ‘stratigraphical’ analysis deals with the area of wall
extending from the south-west corner of the Haram to the
northern limit of the columned hall. Beyond this point,
attached to the Haram wall to the north, there formerly existed
a group of buildings (see plate 22.7), some of which may have
belonged to the Fakhriyya according to the Ottoman Tahrir
registers (cited above, p. 260). These buildings were
demolished unrecorded in 1968-69 and the wall partly rebuilt.

Fig. 22.8 illustrates the various phases of building. The
precise dating of the pre-Mamlik ‘strata’ need not detain us
here, but it is worth noting that there is only a trace of an
Umayyad phase (masonry type 2). Round the corner, however,
at the south wall, the masonry which we consider to be
Umayyad (see p. 45) is plentiful, built directly on top of the
 distinctive Herodian masonry, type 1. Immediately above the
Umayyad masonry at the south wall comes masonry of type 3
which extends round to the west wall, and which may belong to
the ‘Abbasid period. Masonry type 4, under the unmistakable
Crusader masonry type 5, may be Fatimid. The regularly bossed
masonry type 5 of the Templar Hall originally continued north
as far as the dotted line x-x!. North of that line, under the
columned hall, there is another masonry, type 6, incorporating
here and there bossed stones similar to those of the Crusader
type 5. These bossed stones seem to be in secondary use and
this part of the wall may be remains of the substructure of the
western Ayyubid hall. Whatever the actual date of masonry type
6 may be, it is sure that it precedes the masonry type 7 above it,
which belongs to the columned hall and is, so far as we can tell,
Mamluk. Finally there are repairs made in masonry type 8,
which not only separates type 4 from type 6 but, as the
continuity of the coursing shows, extends over the top of type
7. This makes it the latest of all, almost certainly Ottoman. Two
rows of putlog holes are discernible in this masonry.

Certain conclusions can be drawn from this analysis of
masonry types. The north-west corner of the Templar Hall
collapsed evidently before the western Ayyabid hall was
constructed since the masonry of type 6 extends southwards
beyond the line x-x'. The Ayyabid hall itself subsequently
collapsed, perhaps in the earthquake of 702/1303. Masonry type
7 seems to belong to the Fakhriyya, built after that collapse but
 some time before 732/1332 (the date of the death of the
founder) on the remains of the western Ayyabid hall. Later still,
probably in the Ottoman period, repairs to the north-west
corner of the Templar Hall made in masonry type 8 included
the replacement of the vaulting of the columned hall (see
below).

(iii) Columned hall (plates 22.9 and 22.10)

The relative narrowness of the site limited the width of the
columned hall. It is approximately 8.10m wide and 8.30m long.
This area could have been spanned in the usual way by a cross
vault; indeed, it may originally have been roofed in this way.
Now a row of three columns supporting transverse arches and
six small vaults divides the hall from north to south into two
aisles of three bays each. Iron tie-bars above the column
capitals help to brace the structure. The vaults of the east aisle
are elliptical and those of the west one are domical. Both types
are typically Ottoman in Jerusalem, as are their carved stone
crescent finials (one of which is visible in plate 22.8). The
masonry analysis of the west wall also suggests that the upper
part of the structure is Ottoman. They may be part of the repairs
made in 963/1556 (above, p. 260). Three windows in masonry
type 7, thought to be Mamluk, open in the west wall in positions
corresponding to the centres of the vaulting bays, suggesting
that the Ottoman builders arranged their columns and vaults to
 accommodate existing openings. A doorway (now blocked) in
the east wall opened into the former Jami‘ al-Maghariba and it
too is accommodated by the vaulting system. The two archways
in the north wall are aligned with the aisles, and they must
belong to the Ottoman reconstruction. :
A mibrab (fig. 22.9, plate 22.11) beautifully constructed in
marble ablaq and flanked by two re-used Crusader columns
complete with capitals and bases, is placed not quite in the
centre of the south wall. A marble border frames its pointed
arch and forms a loop over the keystone. Within the loop a
roundel is inscribed with the phrase Ui’l/db, ‘for Allah’. This
marble border has an unfinished appearance on the left side.
The wall containing the mibrab blocks the archway that
 originally opened into the Templar Hall (see above, p 261).
The right-hand springing of that archway is still visible (see fig.
22.7), as is its crown above the roof of the columned hall. The
mibrab has been set as far to the right as possible within the
confines of that earlier archway in an apparent effort to have it
as close as possible to the central axis of the hall. The present
row of columns is arranged so that the east aisle is wider than
the west one, obviously in order to avoid masking the mibrab.
In this the builders did not entirely succeed for in places the
south-east transverse arch overlaps the looped marble border
round the mibradb arch (plate 22.11). At its other end it
overlapped the left-hand edge of a re-used Koranic inscription
in sixth/twelfth-century foliated R7#/7 script in marble that was
built into the south wall? Thus it is clear that the mihrab
preceded the Ottoman vaulting; it is typically eighth/fourteenth
century Mamluk in style and must surely belong to the
Fakhriyya.

At the east end of the south wall the narrow pointed-
arched doorway (plate 22.12) marked ‘C’ on the plan (fig. 22.3)
leads down to that western part of the Templar Hall that al-
‘Umari’s text*! appears to include as a sort of extension of
 * We should like to thank Mr Mark Potter (who, with the assistance of Mr Graeme
Pert, was largely responsible for our survey of the site) for helpful discussion of

 (Rharja fi) the Fakhriyya. Mujir al-Din states that the adjoining
Haram minaret (see below, pp. 270-272) is built upon the
assembly hall (majma‘) of the Fakhriyya.°’ The doorway is
flanked by corner columns, obviously in re-use for one has a
base for a capital and the other, though it has a Crusader thick-
leaf capital, has a bulbous base in typical Mamluk style.

To the right of the mibrab a cupboard (see plate 22.9) has
been opened in the masonry, perhaps intended to hold Korans.
Evidence of the collapse of the north-west corner of the
Templar Hall may be seen in repairs to the wall on the right-
hand side above the cupboard.

The floor of the hall is laid with a polychrome marble
pavement set out in a pattern (fig. 22.10) which seems to take
little account of the architecture. The central strip of paving
does not align with the mibrab and in several places rough
limestone pavers are used instead of marble. The pattern
suggests that the present pavement is not the original one. It is
quite probable that the marble itself belongs to an original
Mamluk pavement, but it was lifted and relaid at some time,
possibly when the columns were introduced to support the
new vaulting.

24 The eastern hall lies partly over the staircase leading up from the Herodian
gate known since the nineteenth century as Barclay’s Gate. Consequently, that
gate must have been blocked at the time of construction of the Ayyabid halls, if not
earlier.
25 Al-‘Umari (Masdlik, 153) is careful to point out that, although called jami's,
congregational mosques, the Women’s Mosque and the Maghribi Mosque were in
fact masjids:
We have used the expression Jami‘ al-Maghariba because this is the name
most commonly used. Had we said Masjid al-Maghariba the people of
Jerusalem would not have understood it; this is also the case with the
Women’s Mosque. Neither of these is a j@mi‘ in which the kbutba is read:
each has a single imam who leads the five prayers there and nothing else.

 "
24,"II SITE AND BUILDING (plate 23.1)
","The minaret is built directly on top of the north wall of the
Templar Hall that extends westward from the Aqsa Mosque. It
was originally reached from the yard south of the columned
hall of the Fakhriyya (no. 22) by way of a staircase rising in the
thickness of the spine wall of the Ayyabid halls (see above, p.
263). A later stairway against the west wall of the Ayyubid halls
now provides access to the minaret.

Though much smaller than other minarets around the
Haram, the present Fakhriyya Minaret is of the traditional
Syrian ‘square tower’ type. The shaft is divided by mouldings
into three ‘storeys’, above which two tiers of muqarnas
corbelling carry a muezzin’s gallery around a square chamber,
smaller in area than the shaft and surmounted by an octagonal
drum and lead-covered dome.

The minaret appears to have been completely rebuilt in
the Ottoman period, and the upper part of the shaft together
with the muezzin’s gallery were renewed in the 1920s. Nothing
is known of the original form of the minaret.
 The first minaret [that he describes] is situated on the fore
lie. southern] part (mugaddam) of the Haram at the
south-west angle, above the Fakhriyya Madrasa. It is the
most finely built of them for it has no foundations and it
stands on the assembly hall (majma‘) of the Fakhriyya
Madrasa. Perhaps it was built by the founder (saihib)! of the
Fakhriyya — God knows best!”

Mujir al-Din’s suggestion that the founder of the Fakhriyya was
responsible for this minaret cannot be maintained since al-
‘Umari, who wrote his description of the Haram about thirteen
years after the death of the founder (see above, p. 259), makes
no mention of a minaret here.? Al-‘Umari gives precise details
of those minarets that did exist in his day — the Ghawanima and
Bab al-Silsila minarets (nos. 10 and 20) — and so we can assume
that this minaret did not exist then (c.745/1345). It must,
therefore, have been erected some time after 745/1345 and
before 901/1496 when Mujir al-Din completed his account.‘ A
more exact date for the original construction remains to be
established.
 "
24,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","ACCESS STAIRS

In the yard north of the columned hall of the Fakhriyya eight
steps against the west face of the spine wall of the Ayyubid halls
rise southward to a pointed-arched doorway (see plate 22.5; fig.
22.3). This doorway leads to a further flight of steps within the
thickness of the spine wall. At the head of the steps is a stone
chamber of recent construction. A door in the west wall of this
chamber gives access to the roof of the columned hall of the
Fakhriyya; and a door in the east wall opens on the roof of the
eastern Ayyubid hall. The minaret will have been reached from
this staircase by crossing the roof of the Ayyubid hall.

SHAFT (elevations: figs. 22.6 and 23.2; plate 23.2)

The decoration of the shaft is concentrated on the north face
where an entrance door gives on a spiral staircase rising within
the shaft to the muezzin’s gallery.
 The entrance door is set in a very shallow recess framed by
a quirked ogee moulding. On either side of the door are two
carved stone bosses (see plate 23.3); and over the lintel is a
relieving arch of voussoirs with rebated joints. A raised stone
disk or patera three courses above the relieving arch is carved
in low relief with a five-pointed star.

The lower storey is divided from the second storey by a
quirked ogee moulding. One course above that moulding are
a further two paterae decorated with six- and eight-pointed
stars. In the middle of this storey a shallow recess with a sloping
sill and a mugarnas head (plate 23.4) contains paired slit
windows separated by a dumpy column. The windows have
little fluted conchs carved in their common lintel.

A billet moulding marks the transition from the second to
the third storey. Three courses above this moulding a change in
the colour and texture of the stone indicates that the upper part
of the minaret is a later reconstruction. An inscription under
the canopy of the muezzin’s gallery gives the date: 1342/1923-
24. Contemporary photographs’ show that the top of the
minaret was dismantled and completely rebuilt at that time.
The earlier muezzin’s gallery was carried on roll corbels.
 DATE

While the date of reconstruction of the top of the minaret is
known, the date of construction or reconstruction of the shaft
is not. It appears to belong to a single phase of construction,
there being no trace of any earlier masonry. The style of
decoration — notably the feeble profile of the moulding around
the entrance door, the paterae above the door, and the finicky
daintiness of the mugarnas head of the window recess — is

means its founder (Mujir, 404, 426).

4 Al-Suytti, writing shortly after 875/1470, calls the Bab al-Silsila Minaret (no. 20)
the ‘southern’ one, implying that none existed to the south of it, but it is difficult

to believe that if the Fakhriyya Minaret was built after that date Mujir al-Din would
not have known its history,

 characteristic of Ottoman architecture in Jerusalem.

Evliya Celebi, who visited Jerusalem in 1083/1672, saw
only three minarets in the Haram area and he specifically stated
that there was none by the Mosque of the Malikis (the Jami‘ al-
Maghariba).° Thus the minaret seen by Mujir al-Din must have
fallen before Evliya Celebi's visit, perhaps in the earthquake of
952/1546, and have been rebuilt some time after 1083/1672.

 "
25,"II SITE AND BUILDINGS (jig. 24.2)
","The general title Stiq al-Qattanin, ‘Market of the Cotton
Merchants’, the popular name for this market-street since the
ninth/fifteenth century though not the original one,' has been
adopted to introduce conveniently the building complex
shown on fig. 24.2. This huge complex was designed as a sort of
commercial centre comprising a long covered market-street
with shops on either side and monumental entrances at each
end, living quarters (rubii‘, plural of rab‘) above the shops, two
public bath-houses known as Hammam al-Shifa’ (the Bath of
Healing) and Hammam al-‘Ayn (the Bath of the Spring) and a
khéin or caravanserai.’

Fig. 24.13 illustrates the marked difference between the
frontage of the shops in the western part (bays 1-16) of the
market-street and that of the shops in the eastern part (bays 17—
30). The lower western part appears to belong to a different
order of construction and design from the eastern part. The
large, rock-face bossed masonry of the lower courses in the
western part rises to a height of several metres at either end,
suggesting that it belongs to an earlier building which lay in
ruins when the construction of the Mamlik market-street was
begun. The relatively strong corners at each end would
naturally survive a collapse better than the interconnecting
walls. Unfortunately no systematic analysis of the various types
of masonry to be found in Jerusalem has yet been completed,’
and so it is impossible to establish with certainty the age of this
masonry. It does, however, resemble the bossed masonry
under the Tankiziyya (above, p. 228), which is probably
Crusader.

Vertical joints in the masonry where the eastern part of the
market-street meets the western part between bays 16 and 17
(figs. 24.11 and 24.18, plates 24.1 and 24.2) confirm that the
lower part of the structure was built in two stages. The fact that
the eastern part is built against the distinctive bossed masonry
of the western part suggests that this masonry is 777 sitt. Enough
of the masonry survives at the west end of the market-street
(plate 24.3) to show that the present west entrance is built on
the remains of an earlier one. Indeed, the whole of the western
part of the market-street appears to be built on the remains of
an earlier market hall, which in that case must have been laid
out along much the same lines. There is nothing in the present
layout of the western part of the market-street to contradict a
Crusader origin: a Crusader market hall, similar in plan, exists
at the Wakala (see below, p. 480). It is known that Frederick II
 Fe ee ee ee a Ti Sh TD WY tee
required to deposit their goods pending the levying of customs
dues,‘ and it is possible that these formed part of that system.

Thus it transpires that the western part of Siq al-Qattanin
is founded upon the remains of an earlier market, possibly
Crusader, which may well have been ruined by an earthquake.
This earlier market was entered from the valley street, Tariq al-
Wad; there is no indication that it ever extended to the east of
bay 16 of the present market-street. On the contrary, the vertical
joints in the masonry between bays 16 and 17 seem to show that
the earlier market stopped there, about 40m short of the Haram
wall.

Consequently Tankiz, acting for Sultan  al-Nasir
Muhammad (see below), undertook to build on the ruins of
that earlier market a new market-street extending eastward to
reach the Haram where a monumental new gate, Bab al-
Qattanin, was erected (plate 24.8). Since the earlier market
drew its clientele from the street, its floor level matched the
level of the street (plate 24.3). The eastern extension of the
market, possibly for ease of construction, continued at that
level, which means that at the east end it is about 4m below the
level of the Haram. This difference in level is accommodated by
two flights of steps, an eastern flight within the Haram and a
western flight within the market-street (see section, fig. 24.18).
In this way soil excavated from within the Haram to form the
eastern flight could be utilized to form a ramp for the western
flight: an intelligent and economical method of construction.

At the eastern end of the earlier market (at bay 16) there
are two passages, one leading north to Tariq Bab al-Hadid, the
other leading south to the boiler room of the eastern bath-
house, Hammam al-Shifa’.

The location of Hammam al-Shifa’ at the east end of the
pre-Mamluk market suggests that it functioned at the same time
as that market. In fact, the curious orientation of this bath-house
(see fig. 24.2), divergent from the alignment of the market,
would appear to indicate that its foundations predate those of
the market. This curious orientation is unique among the
buildings close to the Haram border and the reasons for it are
unclear. There is nothing in the layout of the contiguous
Haram-oriented Ablutions Place (mathara), the former sigaya
of al-‘Adil,’ to the south that might offer a clue. It can only be
supposed that the orientation is accidental, that this earlier
(possibly pre-Crusader) structure originally stood in isolation
not bound to follow the Haram-oriented grid pattern of
surrounding streets (see above, p. 44). The choice of such an
 Fiate 24.4 Vauited nail nortn Of DayS O—1 1

isolated situation may have been influenced by an available
water supply® — a deep well that intrigued Victorian explorers
(see fig. 24.10).’

The western bath-house, Hammam al-‘Ayn, situated to the
south of bays 1-3 of the market-street, is normally oriented and
though its floor level is considerably lower than that of the
market-street (see fig. 24.16) it has the typical plan and
appearance of an original Mamlak hammam.*

Similarly the kbdn situated between the two bath-houses
is obviously an original Mamlik foundation. While its courtyard
walls are constructed partly of stones with distinctive rock-face
bosses of the type described above, the irregular disposition of
these stones indicates that here they are in secondary use.

To the north of bays 6-10 of the market street is a large hall
roofed by nine cross vaults supported on four piers (see plate
24.4) with three long barrel-vaulted chambers extending
eastwards from it. This hall is now reached by a zigzag passage
from the street, Tariq al-Wad. A blocked opening in the south
wall of the hall may, however, once have given access to it from
the market-street by way of the north shop at bay 8. This hall and
its eastern annexes should perhaps be associated with a khan,
known as Khan al-Qattanin, which was founded by Zaynab al-
Khassakiyya, wife of Sultan Inal (reigned 857/1453 to 865/1461)
and mother of his successor, al-Mu’ayyad Shihab al-Din,
according to a document dated 937/1531.’ A later document
records that the khan comprised bawdyik (large vaulted
warehouses?), upper and lower storerooms, and shops in Stiq
al-Qattanin.'°

Another khan, somewhere to the south of Si al-Qattanin,
was founded by the Qadi Fakhr al-Din b. Nusayba some time in
the last three decades of the ninth/fifteenth century. Its
northern boundary is given as the furnace of the Hammam of
Tankiz (i.e. Hammam al-‘Ayn); its western boundary was the
street, Tariq al-Wad.'!
 "
25,"II HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION AND DATE

The Sitiq al-Qattanin complex contains three inscriptions and
an artisan’s ‘signature’.'* Two of the foundation inscriptions are
at the monumental east entrance, the so-called Bab al-Qattanin,
one on the east face of the lintel of the gateway and the other on
brass bands adorning the west face of the original wooden
doors.'* The door leaves open towards the Haram, fitting
flushly into lateral reveals, and so the inscription is visible when
the doors are open. This inscription is essentially an extended

version of the one on the lintel which, though partly eroded,
can be read thus:

In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. This
gate was built anew (juddida) in the reign of... al-Malik al-
Nasir Muhammad... on the instruction of (bi-ishara or bt-
 mubdshara) Sayt al-Din Tankiz al-Nasiri ... in the months
of the year 73(7) (1336-37).!4

Only the first letter, st, of the last number of the date in the
inscription on the lintel is clearly legible, but traces of the letter
ayn show that this must be saba’, seven, and the date 737, not
736. Mujir al-Din, who will have seen this inscription in a better
state of preservation, confirms that the date of construction was
737.” The inscription on the doors is better preserved and
contains the date 736 (1335-36). Thus the doors were made
before the inscription was carved on the lintel of the gate.

(the text is not quite clear) indicates that the foundation was a

Al-Umari, who visited Jerusalem in 745/1345 or
thereabouts, less than ten years after the completion of the

Only the first letter, s772, of the last number of the date in the
inscription on the lintel is clearly legible, but traces of the letter
ayn show that this must be saba’, seven, and the date 737, not
736. Mujir al-Din, who will have seen this inscription in a better
state of preservation, confirms that the date of construction was
737.” The inscription on the doors is better preserved and
contains the date 736 (1335-36). Thus the doors were made
before the inscription was carved on the lintel of the gate.

... Next to this part of the west portico is a big gate, recently

(al-qaysariyya al-mustajadda) is reached. It contains [two]
rows of shops, some of which are waqf of the Haram and
some are waqf of the madrasa and khanqah which were
founded by the Amir Sayf al-Din Tankiz.’”

On the lintel over the entrance to the khan is another
inscription. The first and last words of this inscription are quite
illegible and the full text cannot be ascertained. A plausible
restoration as suggested by van Berchem is:

[... has ordered the construction of this khan] and market
(stuq) and the lodgings (rubiz‘) above it... Tankiz al-Nasiri
... in the months of the year [. . .].8

The inscription incorporates three specimens of Tankiz’s
blazon which, in addition to the inclusion of only Tankiz’s
name, suggests that this part of the complex was ordered by
Tankiz personally. A later document""? records that its revenues
were for the subvention of Tankiz’s madrasa (no. 18) and ribat
(no.19). The khan to which the inscription must refer is now
partly buried under debris, but the original layout — barrel-
vaulted chambers around a large open courtyard — may be
inferred from the surviving remains. The siiq referred to in the
inscription is unlikely to be the main market-street which, as we
know from al-‘Umari’s nearly contemporary account, was
called gaysariyya.” The stig must in fact comprise the shops
which are grouped around the entrance to the khan; that is,
four booths, two on each side, opening on a broad entrance
hall leading south from the market street to the khan.

As for the bath-houses, since they contain no inscription
we must turn to the literary evidence. Al-‘Umari and Ibn
Taghribirdi (died 874/1470) both attribute to Tankiz two bath-
houses in Jerusalem.”! This is confirmed by a copy made in
1020/1611 of the wagfiyya (endowment deed) of the
Tankiziyya dated 730/1330, which states that the two baths,
south and west, near Wadi al-Tawwahin (Tariq al-Wad) were
founded by Tankiz and that the income from them was for the
subvention of his madrasa and khanqah.” The description of
these two baths fits the ones now known as Hammam al Shifa’
and Hammam al-‘Ayn, attached to Stq al-Qattanin. Thus these
two bath-houses must have been in existence by 730/1330.

If the epigraphic and textual evidence indicates that the
Stiq al-Qattdénin complex comprises both royal and amiral
foundations, the continuity of the upper part of the structural
fabric shows that the complex was planned and built as a
complete architectural entity.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY
At the end of the ninth/fifteenth century Mujir al-Din was
impressed by the quality of its construction: ‘it is a market of
 extraordinary height and solidity; you will not find its like in
many towns.” But by the nineteenth century Sig al-Qattanin
created a less favourable impression, for by then it had become
neglected and was used as a rubbish dump.*4

The Bab al-Qattanin was repaired in about 1890,” but the
market-street remained full of rubbish. When the Pro-
Jerusalem Society undertook its restoration in 1919, it was ‘a
public latrine, the shops filled with ordure, and the debris in
some cases was lying five foot high’.*° At the same time the khan
housed a flour mill ‘whose 20 h.p. engine was gradually shaking
the ancient masonry out of place. This the Society has
removed.’ The Pro-Jerusalem Society’s restoration affected
only the west end of the Siq al-Qattanin; the east end remained
untouched.” In 1227/1812 Hammam al-‘Ayn was reported to be
in aruined condition — full of rubbish with the boiler house and
some of the rooms lacking their paving and in need of repair.”
Nevertheless, despite the evidently squalid surroundings, the
bath-houses functioned more or less continuously from the
time of their foundation. Until at least 1227/1812 the income
from the Hammam al-‘Ayn was divided between the Haram and
the Tankiziyya,*” but by 1320/1902 the waqf had changed — by
what means is not known — so that the income was entirely for
the benefit of the Khalidi Library (see above, p. 111).

Further repairs were made to Bab al-Qattanin in 1927.7! In
1966 it was proposed that a folk museum be established in the
khan,” but the plan was never implemented. The khan was
more imaginatively used as a farm where a wonderful variety of
livestock was reared.

It was not until 1974 that the market-street was extensively
restored (plate 24.7) and reopened by the Department of
Awqaf.* More recently, in 1984 the Department of Islamic
Archaeology began work on the restoration of Hammam al-
‘Ayn and, it is proposed, Hammam al-Shifa’. And so it is
anticipated that the components of this magnificent complex,
the finest bazaar in Syria according to Creswell,** may regain
their corporate identity and once more produce revenues for
the upkeep of the Haram.
 "
25,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","It is written over it [the gate] that the Sultan al-Malik al-
Nasir Muhammad b. Qalawin rebuilt it (addada
imaratabu) in the year 737 (1336-37).
 Thus Mujir considered the gate to have been built on the site of
an earlier gate, but this conclusion may have been based on a
misinterpretation of the inscription. What the inscription
 actually says is juddida hadha t bab... the Means ON [Aan
in this context is ambiguous; either ‘was renewed’ or ‘was built
anew’ would fit2° Van Berchem, following Mujir al-Din, opted
for the former, while Grabar favours the latter. The
archaeological evidence, in so far as the pre-Mamlik market
opened off the street and stopped about forty metres short of
the Haram wall, tends to suggest that there was no pre-Mamlik
gate. The substantial difference in level between the market-
street and the Haram, accommodated by two flights of steps
evidently built as part of the Mamlak development, also
suggests that no earlier gate existed. At least, there is no visible
evidence of any earlier adjustment of the levels nor of any
earlier gate. The pre-Crusader descriptions of the Haram, as is
well known,” include lists of gates, but none that can be
satisfactorily associated with the site of the present Bab al-
Qattinin. Indeed, had an earlier gate existed there, it would be
difficult to explain the close proximity of the Bab al-Mathara
which is only thirteen metres to the south. That gate was
apparently open in the Ayyabid period to give access to the
sigaya Of al-Malik al-‘Adil (589/1193). In short, the indications
are that Bab al-Qattanin is an original Mamlik construction,
‘recently constructed and newly opened’ in al-‘Umari’s words,
to link the new market-street with the Haram.

This new gate was built into the west portico of the Haram.
The lateral walls of the portal open directly under the portico
(plate 24.6), and above these openings is some stalactite
vaulting of the highest quality.** As fig. 12.2 (see fold-out at
back) shows, the two bays of the portico which flank the gate
are larger than the others, rising to buttress the substantial bulk
of the gate itself. The structural harmony of this composition
implies a homogeneity of construction: the gate was
deliberately incorporated as part of the central portico which
connects the two earlier portions of the west portico to the
north and to the south. Mujir al-Din confirms that this portico
was built at the same time as the gate:

The porticoes at the west border of the Haram were
rebuilt during the reign of al-Malik al-Nasir Muhammad...
The portico which extends from the minaret at Bab al-
Silsila to near Bab al-Nazir was built or rebuilt (mira) in
the year 737.”

The gateway is set in a trefoil-headed recess contained within a
much larger recess spanned by a vast semidome supported on
five tiers of stalactite corbelling (plate 24.9). The ablaq
voussoirs of the trefoil arch“ over the gateway are alternately
cream-coloured limestone and black bituminous limestone.
 The voussoirs of the pointed arch which frames the slightly
smaller frontal arch of the semidome are of red and cream-
coloured ablaq, the usual combination in Jerusalem. The
cornice moulding which crowns the composition steps up on
either side of the semidome before curving over the crown of
the arch. The profile of this moulding is not typically Mamlak,
seeming to belong rather to an earlier period. The section
which bends up over the crown of the arch was obviously made
specially for the gate and so must date from 737/1336-37 or
thereabouts. But the fact that this section is less eroded than the
adjoining straight sections suggests that these straight sections
might have been re-used. There are analogous cyma mouldings
below the parapets of both the Golden Gate (Umayyad?) and
the south wall of the Aqsa Mosque. R.W. Hamilton has proposed
a Fatimid (fifth/eleventh century) date for the Aqs4 moulding,”
although an earlier dating should not be ruled out. A similar
moulding is to be found below the parapet of the south wall of
the Umayyad Great Mosque at Damascus, which was built by al-
Walid between 88/707 and 96/714-15.% A more detailed
comparison of these mouldings is needed before any firm
conclusion can be reached.

The architecture of the gate has been likened to the
entrance portal at the Tankiziyya,® but there is no strong
resemblance between the two. Distinctive features of the Bab
al-Qattanin (plate 24.10) not to be found in the Tankiziyya
portal (plate 18.8) are: the stepped plan, the ablaq trefoil-
headed gate recess, the five-tiered muqarnas system, the
undecorated semidome, the ablaq voussoirs of the recess arch,
and the cyma cornice moulding bent around the arch.
Consequently van Berchem’s suggestion that the two
monuments are perhaps the work of the same architect is not
really supported by the architectural evidence.

Van Berchem is correct, however, in observing that Bab al-
Qattanin faces to the Haram and announces the market-street
to the west rather than the Haram to the east. But there are
indications that the western approach to the gate was decorated
as well. The abutments of the present cross vault which spans
the western flight of steps leading up to the gate are obviously
later additions; hence the vault itself must also be a later
addition. The bay spanned by the original vault — before the
present vaulting abutments were introduced — is almost exactly
square in plan, which suggests that the original vault may have
been domical. Re-used muqarnas fragments (plate 24.11) built
into the walls of the room directly above the present vault (fig.
24.18), match in size and general style the fourth tier of
mugarnas corbelling supporting the semidome of Bab al-
 Qattanin. These mugarnas fragments are thus of such a size
and shape as would be suitable for the transition zone of a
dome over the western approach to the gate. An exemplary
model of a dome on a muqarnas transition zone is to be found
just a stone’s throw away at the inner porch of Bab al-Nazir
(plate 35.3) built in 707/1307-08 for al-Nasir Muhammad.

Whatever the original vaulting of this bay on the town side
of Bab al-Qattanin was — and the indications outlined above
show that it was probably a dome — it collapsed or was
demolished some time before the present cross vault was
erected. The room above must have been built shortly after
the erection of that cross vault. Apparently at the same time a
little pointed-arched window, visible in the early photographs
of the gate, “° was opened in the tympanum of the trefoil arch.
This window was blocked and the arch refurbished during the
1927 repairs.*”

WESTERN ENTRANCE (plate 24.3)

The lower part of the western entrance to Siiq al-Qattanin
appears to belong to the pre-Mamlik (Crusader) phase of
construction since the distinctive bossed masonry survives
apparently i situ to a height of almost four metres. The
Mamluk masonry above is smooth-faced.

A tall pointed-arch recess encloses the entrance proper,
which is spanned by a flat arch composed of seven interlocking
voussoirs surmounted by a relieving arch and a circular oculus.
The flat arch rests on simply profiled shoulders in a similar
fashion to the lintel at the entrance to the khan, which bears
Tankiz’s foundation inscription.

Flanking the recess are two springings for vaults (plate
24.3) which either spanned or were intended to span across
Tariq al-Wad on each side of the entrance. These vault
springings are integral parts of the springers of the recess arch
and must be contemporaneous with it. The vaults themselves
may never have been built; no trace of them exists and there is
no indication of corresponding abutments on the opposite side
of the street.

The moulding which extends across the central part of the
west facade just below the parapet above the entrance is again
not typically Mamluk, being similar to the one over the eastern
entrance, Bab al-Qattanin (above, p. 278).

The western entrance, in contrast to the eastern entrance,
has no doors. Nor could doors ever have been fitted for there
is no provision for hinge sockets and, in any case, the booths
nearest to this entrance would be blocked by opened door
leaves. Likewise the passage leading north from the middle of
 the market street to Tariq Bab al-Hadid was evidently open at
all times. The individual booths in the market-street could be
locked up of course. The gates of Bab al-Qattanin were
therefore to prevent access to the Haram from the market-
street and not vice versa. This arrangement is in accordance
with current practice whereby all the Haram gates are closed at
night, with only a guard patrol remaining within the precinct.

MARKET-STREET (plan, fig. 24.2; section, fig. 24.18)

The market-street extends 95m from east to west. On either
side open ranges of shops. The arched openings of the shops in
the western part of the market-street are different from those in
the eastern part (see fig. 24.18), one of the indications that the
two were separate constructions (see above, p. 273). The barrel
vault roofing the market-street appears, however, to be a
continuous and homogeneous structure.** Transverse arches
spanning across the market-street divide the vaulting into
individual bays (numbered 1-30 on the plan). Alternate
transverse arches are constructed differently: one type is
composed of well-cut voussoirs, the others are mere
simulations built up in plaster, as may be seen between bays 19
and 20 where the plaster has been removed. Each alternate bay
contains a rooflight; those at bays 20, 22 and 24 are now blocked
by later structures on the roof. In three places a pair of adjacent
bays is spanned by a single vault: at bays 8-9 a folded cross vault
rises to an octagonal oculus; at bays 17-18 a cross vault rises to
a mugqarnas cupola at the crown, which is inscribed twice on
the bottom tier of mugarnas with the signature of the craftsman
Muhammad b. Ahmad (see plate 24.12); and at bays 29-30 is the
later cross vault. Each of these double bays marks a special
feature. The one at bays 8-9 corresponds to the entrance to the
khan (thus implying that the khan was built more or less
contemporaneously with the market-street); that at bays 17-18
by the entrance to Hammam al-Shifa’ distinguishes the west
end of the eastward extension of the market-street towards the
Haram; and the cross vault at bays 29-30 replaces what appears
to have been a dome next to the Haram gate (see above).

The street pavement was re-levelled during the recent
restoration. Originally it sloped gently down from the foot of
the steps at bay 28 to emerge at the west end on the same level
as the street, Tariq al-Wad (see plate 24.3), where four new
steps have been built to compensate for the re-levelling. Stone
benches on either side of the market-street, which still survive
in the eastern part (see plate 24.7), originally continued for the
full length of the street. These benches provided space where
merchants could display their wares and conduct their
business. The continuity of the benches was interrupted on
the north side at bay 16 where a flight of steps rises north to the
lane leading to Tariq Bab al-Hadid, and on the south side at bay
21 where the rear wall of a shop has been breached at some
time to give access to the Ablutions Place (formerly the sigdya
ofal-‘Adil). Presumably there will also have been a break on the
south side at bays 8-9, the entrance to the khan.
 OFFER FLOOK LOUGINGS (plan, J1§. 44.9)
On either side of the market-street are a series of small upper
floor rooms that provide lodgings (rubiz’). Two on the south
side (at bays 11 and 15) have what appears to be a blocked
trapdoor in the middle of the floor, suggesting that they were
used as storerooms for the shops below. Each room is lit by a
small window opening on the market-street (see plate 24.13
and fig. 24.18).

On the north side of the market-street the barrel-vaulted
rooms of the rub‘ ran in a continuous series, one above each
shop, with a more elaborate cross-vaulted chamber at the east
end (bays 29-30). The two westernmost rooms have been
replaced by a later (Ottoman) hall. A corridor on the north side
of the rooms, now blocked in several places (see plan, fig. 24.3),
gave access to them (plate 24.14). This corridor appears to have
been reached by a dog-leg staircase entered from the lane
leading to Tariq Bab al-Hadid.

On the south side of the market-street the arrangement of
rooms is similar except for interruptions at Hammam al-Shifa’
and at the khan. At Hammam al-Shifa’ the entrance porch
(higher than the adjoining shops, section, fig. 24.15) and a well-
room on the roof (see below, p. 286) intervene between the
room at bay 16 and the one at bay 21. At the khan, its tall
entrance hall intervenes. The easternmost rooms (bays 27-30)
on this side have been incorporated into the later Ribat al-
Zamani (see below, p. 576). Access to the other rooms is from
the roofs of neighbouring buildings (plate 24.15). These roofs
are reached by an open stair on the north side of Zuqaq Bab al-
Mathara and another on the east side of Tariq al-Wad over the
boiler-room of Hammam al-‘Ayn (see below).

KHAN TANKIZ (plan, fig. 24.6; section, fig. 24.12)
At bays 8-9 of the market-street a broad archway (now partly
blocked by a modern wall) opens to the hall leading south to
the entrance to the khan. The shops on either side of this
entrance hall are virtually identical in design and construction
to those in the western part of the market-street.

The tall barrel vault of the entrance hall is divided into
three bays by transverse arches. Excisions in either side
provide clearance for high-level windows admitting light to the
lodgings on the upper floor. At the crown of the central vaulting
bay is a square rooflight like those in the market-street. On the
roof a masonry cowl (see plate 24.16), open to the south,

PERE ee en’ eos

 shelters this rooflight. It may be presumed that similar cowls
once sheltered the rooflights in the market-street, which are
now fitted with modern glass covers.

At the south end of the entrance hall is a doorway, 2.76m
wide, that leads to the khan. It was originally fitted with double
doors opening south, but these have long since disappeared.
The doorway is spanned by a monolithic lintel which is
supported at each end on corbels and surmounted by a
relieving arch composed of three massive stones (see fig.
24.18). The damaged foundation inscription (cited above, p.
277) is carved on the keystone of the relieving arch, on the
lintel, and on the corbels. Tankiz’s blazon — a cup on an
undivided circular shield — decorates the middle of the lintel
and is repeated on either side of the corbels. Above the
doorway a segmental-arched window admits light to the
entrance hall.

The entrance doorway opens into a large courtyard. A
substantial wall now divides the courtyard from north to south
(plate 24.16). Since this wall abuts on the north wall of the
courtyard without keying into it, it would appear to be a later
insertion.

Various doors, some altered from their original form,
open in the east, north and west sides of the courtyard. At the
east and west ends of the north side they open into large barrel-
vaulted chambers now used as stables. Square openings (now
blocked) at the crowns of the vaults provided light and
ventilation. The east wall of the western chamber has been
dismantled at some time to connect this chamber with the two
western shops in the entrance hall (see plate 24.17). That later
opening to the northern of these shops has subsequently been
blocked by a concrete partition.

The structures on the south side are now buried under an
enormous pile of debris retained by a modern wall across this
end of the courtyard. Nothing is known of the former structures
there. Fig. 24.7 gives an impression of what the original layout
might have been. In the west side of the courtyard only one
door remains. It opens into a plain barrel-vaulted chamber. In
the east side an archway (now partly blocked) and two
doorways (see section, fig. 24.12) lead into barrel-vaulted
rooms. The southern of these rooms has a splayed embrasure
to a window giving on the court of the Ablutions Place to the

east.

 remains of the springing of an arch (see plate 24.18) which
might once have supported a_ staircase to additional
accommodation on an upper floor, but of such no trace exists.

BATH-HOUSES

A familiar feature of Islamic towns is the public bath-house,
usually located close to the markets and congregational
mosque, where bathing for ritual or social purposes could be
enjoyed in pleasant surroundings.” The plans of these bath-
houses, derived from Roman baths, varied little. An entrance,
usually quite plain, led into a spacious changing room. Latrines
were generally isolated from the changing room by a long
passageway. From the changing room bathers progressed
through cold and warm rooms to the hot room. The bathing
rooms were roofed by domes perforated with little circular
windows through which shafts of light penetrated the steamy
 atmosphere. Next to the hot room, water was heated in a boiler
room which, along with its associated fuel store, had a separate
‘service’ access. Both bath-houses connected with Siq al-
Qattanin have this sequence of rooms, but their disposition
varies in each.

(@) Hammam al-Shifa’ (plan, fig. 24.5; section, fig. 24.15).

In the copy of Tankiz’s wagfiyya (see above, p. 225 n. 17) this
bath is referred to as the Southern Bath; it is situated to the
south of the market-street. The waqfiyya includes a brief
description of the layout and fittings, which have altered little
over the centuries.

While the oblique alignment of the northern and eastern
parts of the bath-house suggest that they are built on older
foundations, the normal orientation of the south-eastern part
indicates that it is Mamltk.

On the south side of the market-street at bays 18-20 three
 courtyard fromthe south —

archways, similar to those of the shops in the eastern half of the
street, open on a vaulted entrance porch. Originally a wide
opening (now blocked) in the south wall of the porch led
directly into the changing room.

The changing room, called mashlah in the wadfiyya,
consists ofa large hall roofed by a folded cross vault rising to an
octagonal oculus at the crown, now covered by a modern
cylindrical rooflight that probably replaces an earlier lantern
(see plate 24.19). The vault is criss-crossed with wires from
which towels hang to dry (see plate 24.20).

Towards the middle of the floor, not quite under the
oculus, stands an octagonal marble tank containing a fountain
enclosed by a later iron cage in baroque style. The fountain is
made from a hollowed-out Byzantine basketwork capital (with
 of roofs from south-east

Chi-Rho monograms alternating with trefoils in a guilloche
round the rim) resting on a short marble column. It no longer
works; some hydraulic system must once have maintained a
supply of water to the fountain through the column shaft into
the hollow capital from where it poured through holes in the
side into the tank, which also has holes in its sides to let the
water spill into a gutter around the base. From the gutter water
 will presumably have run off into a drain, perhaps to a cistern.

The floor of the changing room is paved with slabs of fine
greyish marble, possibly the original pavement though the
wagdfiyya states that it was of coloured marble. Arched recesses
with raised floors reached by three steps in the east, south and
west sides of the room are where bathers dress and undress
and may relax with a refreshing drink. There is asmaller arched
recess in the back wall of the south recess, and two alcoves in
the back wall of the east recess. To the north of the east recess
a short barrel-vaulted passage leads to a door, now the sole
entrance to the bathhouse. According to the wagfiyya there
were three iron [grilled] windows in this side of the room —
presumably the present door and two alcoves — which opened
ona little garden (junayna) planted with orange trees and rose
bushes. Sadly, this garden no longer exists.

A doorway in the south-east corner of the changing room
leads into a small lobby from which a long corridor (now
blocked) led south to an oblong room with a pierced dome,
now partly collapsed (plate 24.21). This room must originally
have housed the latrines. The present latrine is located at the
north end of the corridor, and the south end (beyond the
modern blocking wall) now serves as the entrance to the men’s
latrines in the Ablutions Place.”!

At the lobby, a door opposite the one from the changing
room opens south into the first bathing room. This is the cold
room where bathers might undress close to the warmer rooms
in winter. A stone bench against the west wall returns some way
against the north and south walls (see plan, fig. 24.5). The room
is roofed by a shallow dome on pendentives; the dome (plate
24.22) is pierced by numerous circular windows (several of
which are now blocked) composed of pottery cylinders closed
by glass disks, some coloured, on the exterior.

Near the east end of the south wall of the cold room a door
opens into the warm room. This room is divided by partitions
that appear to be later insertions. Benches against the walls
contain marble washbasins. A small high-level opening in the
west wall gives access to an irregular space (shown on the plan,

Jig. 24.5) with no obvious purpose. The room is roofed in three
bays by perforated oval domes separated by transverse arches.
The glass disks closing the perforations in these domes
occasionally have a protuberant spherical bulb, like the lid of a
bon-bon jar, apparently intended to focus sunlight into
specially brilliant shafts.

From the western bay of the warm room (now divided by
a partition) two doorways open north to the hot room, which
lies to the west of the cold room. A stone bench against the west
wall contains two marble washbasins. In the north-west corner
stands a deep plunge-bath filled with cold water, which is
referred to in the wagfiyya as tashtiyya. The hot room is roofed
like the others by a perforated dome, here supported on
squinches. In the north-west corner of the room a window and

 a door open beside the plunge-bath to a small irregular vaulted
annex furnished with another marble washbasin.

A protrusion in the middle of the west wall of the hot room
covers the furnace. Above this protrusion are two windows
through which steam issues from a boiler placed above and
around the furnace (fig. 24.5).

The furnace is stoked from a vaulted service area to the
west, which is reached by a passageway from a smoke-
blackened pointed-arched doorway in the south side of the
market-street at bay 16. An iwdn-like barrel vaulted recess in
the southern part of the service area would hold a substantial
quantity of fuel (probably animal dung). The boiler is now oil-
fired. The floors of the hot and cold rooms were heated by
exhaust gases from the furnace ducted under the floors to a flue
in the east wall of the cold room (see fig. 24.19).

The original method of supplying water to the boiler
appears complicated. At the north end of the boiler a
passageway (see fig. 24.5) can be seen to lead off in the
 direction of the vertical shaft that was explored and described
in the nineteenth century. This shaft descends about 25.5m
from the roof of the bath-house to a long passage leading
southwards, perhaps originally to connect with the same water
supply that fed the Ablutions Place.” By the nineteenth century
the level of water in this passage was erratic, varying according
to the season.” When the level at the bottom of the shaft was
low someone had to descend the shaft and carry water from a
deeper pool at the end of the passage. The wagfiyya states that
the bath-house was supplied by the main aqueduct from
Solomon’s Pools (ganat known as al-‘Arrab), which Tankiz was
responsible for restoring in 728/1328.”! At any rate, water was
drawn from the passage up the shaft to a well-house on the roof
of the bath-house (plate 24.23). A system of runnels carried
water from the well-house across the roof, presumably to
supply the fountain in the changing room and the boiler.
Nowadays the bath is connected to the city’s water main.
Waste water was drained into gutters, one around the
 fountain (see above) and one that runs along the east wall of the
hot room and then along the north and east walls of the warm
room to a drain in the south-east corner of that room, which is
presumably connected to the same sewer that serves the
Ablutions Place,
(ti) Hammam al-‘Ayn (plan, fig. 24.4; section, fig. 24.16)
Tankiz's waqfiyya refers to this as the Western Bath. It is
situated at the west end of the market-street, immediately south
of the shops at bays 1-3. The orientation of this bath-house is
normal. Its ground floor is about 1.6m below the level of the
Street, Tariq al-Wad, but this need not indicate that the bath is
built on older remains (which might have retained an early
floor level while the level of the street rose with the
accumulation of debris over the years). In fact it is not unusual
for medieval bath-houses to be lower than their surroundings,
apparently in order to facilitate water supply and possibly also
to improve thermal insulation.»

The entrance to the bath-house is from Tariq al-Wad, 3m
 south of the western entrance to the market-street, where a
relatively modern porch (see plate 24.3) now shelters the plain
entrance door which leads down a flight of eight steps to a door
opening south into the changing room. The vault above the
steps protrudes into the shop above (p/ate 24.24) at bay 1 of the
market-street (see section, fig. 24.16).

The changing room is roofed by a dome on double-
faceted pendentives. A circular oculus opens at the crown (see
plate 24.25). Under the oculus an octagonal stone tank contains
a fountain composed of a prismatic stone bowl on a short
marble shaft (see plate 24.26). In each side of the room three
steps lead up to raised platforms set in pointed-arched recesses
where customers dress and undress and may relax after
bathing.

Two segmental-arched openings in the back wall of the
west recess (plate 24.26) admit to booths that once gave on the
street, Tariq al-Wad. These booths belong to a series of shops,
four on each side of the street, forming a small market. The date

orporating results of the following surveys:
 market-street (NON Sige)

In the south wall of the corridor a door opens on the
central axis of the warm and hot bathing areas. It leads directly
into the principal warm room, roofed by a perforated dome on
squinches (plate 24.27). On the east and west sides of this room
wide archways open into subsidiary warm rooms, also roofed
by perforated domes (see plate 24.28). The western subsidiary
room has a stone bench against the side and back walls; other
stone benches flank doorways in the north and south walls of
the principal warm room. The archway into the eastern room is
now partly blocked by a modern concrete wall (plate 24.29)
and the dome replaced with a concrete slab.

The wagqfiyya records that the floor of the bath-house was
originally paved with coloured marble. Now only a small
fragment of the original floor survives in the western subsidiary
room (plate 24.30). This shows the original greyish marble
floor to have been bordered by a band of beautiful polychrome
marble mosaic arranged in star patterns.

The door in the middle of the south wall of the principal
warm room leads to the principal hot room. Doors in the east
and west walls of this room open into subsidiary hot rooms.
The principal room is octagonal in plan (fig. 24.4) with arched
recesses in diagonally opposing corners. This layout of an
octagonal room with subsidiary rooms on two sides is typical of
warm, not hot, rooms in Ayyabid baths in Damascus,” a fact
which, together with the exiguousness of the cold room, might
suggest that in Hammam al-‘Ayn the present hot rooms were
once warm rooms and that an earlier hot room to the south was
subsequently replaced by the present service area. However,
apart from the layout of these rooms there is nothing in the
present structure to suggest that there was ever a hot room to
the south.

The perforated dome and transition zone of the principal
hot room are specially elaborate (plate 24.31). The dome is
divided into sixteen fluted sectors, expressed also on the
exterior (see plate 24.25). The base of each sector is marked by
a pointed-arched niche. The recesses in the north-west, north-
east and south-east corners of the room contain marble
 WasNDasins (See Ppidle 44.54). Lhe recess in te south-west
corner accommodates a plunge-bath. From the middle of the
south wall protrudes the upper section of the flue from the
furnace (see below), above which is a small pointed-arched
window (see plate 24.32) issuing steam from the boiler. A
gutter in the floor runs north from this end of the room along
the central axis of the bathing areas to a drain in the corridor
and, presumably, from there to a sewer under the street to the
west. The subsidiary hot rooms, rectangular in plan, have
curious gabled recesses in their north and south walls
containing marble basins flanked by stone benches (plate
24.33). The domes of these rooms rest on corner squinches
typical of medieval bath-houses (plate 24.35), including a
particularly distinctive intersecting-arch type in the eastern
room (plate 24.34).

To the west of the western subsidiary room a large water
tank was uncovered during the recent restoration work. This
tank, storing water presumably drawn from a branch of the
main aqueduct (see p. 286 n. 54 above), seems originally to
have supplied the bath-house (and subsequently an Ottoman
sabi?’ on the street).

The service area, including the furnace and boiler, is
situated to the south of the hot rooms and reached only from
the street, Tariq al-Wad. There, some 24m south of the entrance
to the bath-house proper, a low vault opens on the east side of
the street. This vault appears to have served as a fuel store. An
opening in its north wall gives access to the furnace. An upper
vault, above the fuel store, also has an Opening to the furnace
and, above that, an aperture to the boiler over the furnace. A
flue protrudes into the principal hot room then runs in a duct
under the floors of that room and the warm room toa chimney
rising in the thickness of the north wall of the corridor.
Investigation of the  interrelationship between _ these
components of the heating system, shown in section in Jig.
24.16, was made possible by an explosion that caused the boiler
to be shut down. The modern use of oil to fire the boiler had
led to a build-up of soot in the flue sufficient to block it and so

cause the explosion. According to the proprietor this was a not
uncommon occurrence.

10 Sijill 6, 190, dated 943/1536. Somewhere in the vicinity was another khan,
called Khan al-Ghadiriyya. The location of this khan, which was a waqf of the
Ghadiriyya Madrasa (see below, p. 527) is given variously as: ‘below (bi-sufl) Bab
al-Qattanin’ (Sijill 2, no. 200); ‘at Bab al-Qattanin’ (Sijill 12, no. 408), and ‘in Bab
 al-Qattanin district’ (Sijill 17, no. 1020; Sijill 100, 120). This khan has not been
identified but in another document it is listed as one of the boundaries of a house
‘in Harat Marzuban, now in Khutt Bab al-Qattanin’ (Sijill 33, 344-46). This suggests
that it lay somewhere to the west of Si al-Qattanin in the direction of the old
Marzuban District (see below, p. 424).

11 Sijill 1, 283, dated 937/1531. To the south of this khan lay a small bath-house
known as Mustahamm Daraj al-‘Ayn (Sijill 10, 91 and 127, cited by K. ‘Asali, Min
atharina fi Bayt al-Maqdis, Amman, 1982, 200). Clermont-Ganneau,

and the steps up to Tariq Bab al-Silsila, known as Darajal-‘Ayn (see above, p. 184),
and these he supposed to be vestiges of an Arab bath.

16 Adistinction between works done by Tankiz on his own behalf and those done
for the State on his recommendation is apparent in the inscriptions. On Tankiz’s
personal foundations (e.g. RCEA nos. 5572, 5589, 5780) his name is introduced by
the verb anshd’a, ‘to found’, or the formula amara bi-insha’, ‘ordered the
construction’, whereas in works done for the State (e.g. RCEA nos. 5587, 5588,
5606, 5607, 5619, 5649, 5660, 5706) his name is introduced by the formula bi-
ishara or bi-mubashara, ‘on the instruction of . The inscription on the Tankiziyya
(no. 18) begins anshd’a, indicating that the foundation was a personal one, while
the inscriptions at Bab al-Qattanin introduce Tankiz with the formula bi-ishara, or
bi-musbdashara. For the significance of the formula bi-ishdra, which ultimately
derives from Saljiiq chancery practice, see S.M. Stern, ‘Petitions from the Mamluk
Period (Notes on the Mamluk Documents from Sinai)’, BSOAS, xxix, 1960, 268-75.

20 The word qaysariyya is derived from the Greek (E. Herzfeld, ‘Etimologia d’al
qaisariyya’, Oriente Moderno, 1962, 691). Its precise denotation is not clearly
established, however. Van Berchem (CIA (Ville), 300) suggests ‘a square building
in the form of a cloister, which encloses rooms, shops and boutiques for
merchants’. A characteristic of qaysariyyas is that they were covered (L.
Hautecoeur and G. Wiet, Les mosquées du Caire, Paris, 1932, 108; MAE, ii, 204)
though not necessarily closed, as has been suggested (D. and J. Sourdel, L’Islam
classique, Paris, 1968, 401). The Siiq al-Qattanin could not be closed (see p. 279).
Qaysariyyas generally housed precious goods, notably costly stuffs like silk and
cotton. Thus ‘a covered market for precious goods’ might serve as a translation if
not a definition. The historical sources are reviewed by A. Raymond and G. Wiet,
Les marchés du Caire, Cairo, 1979, 19-21.

The main entrance, from Tariq Bab al-‘Atm, leads through

enclosed by cells on the north, east and south sides. A vaulted
hall (which we shall call ‘the assembly hall’) occupies the north-
western corner of the building. A staircase in the south-west
corner leads to the roof. A narrow corridor, evidently part ofan
earlier building that occupied the site, takes off north from the
north-east corner of the courtyard then turns east parallel with
Tariq al-Mujahidin. There is no mibrab.

courtyard is a later accretion designed to support part of an
extensive Ottoman development on upper floor levels.
 "
26,"Il HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

The building is anepigraphic® but Mujir al-Din places it with
some care for accuracy ‘in the street of the Gate of the Glory of
the Prophets, opposite the Mu‘azzamiyya, and next to the
Duwaydariyya Madrasa, on the north side of it’. In other words,
it is immediately to the left as one enters the impressive but
somewhat dark street that leads into the Haram through one of
its northern gates, the present day Bab al-‘Atm, otherwise called
Faysal’s Gate. The Sallimiyya’s south boundary met the
property of the Basitiyya (see p. 519) and together these two
institutions formed in early Ottoman times” the west boundary
of the hall (qa ‘a) which gives on to the Bab Hitta Street, situated
between the Awhadiyya and the Maridini Ribat (see p. 412).

DATE

Having named the founder, Mujir al-Din admits to having been
unable to ascertain any date for the foundation but adds,
without explanation, that it appears to have been after the year
700/1300-1.° On stylistic grounds, we have dated the main
entrance portal to c.738/1338 (see below).

FOUNDER

The person who made the original endowment, according to
Mujir al-Din, was the Khwaja, that is, the merchant, Majd al-Din
Abii al-Fida’ Ismail al-Sallami.’ He was born in 671/1272-73 in
the town of Sallamiyya, a day’s journey downstream from Mosul
 on the east bank of the Tigris.* From 717/1317-18, the year in
which his name is first mentioned, he played a major role in the
reign of al-Nasir Muhammad, both as importer of mamltks (he
was tajir al-khdass fi al-raqiq, the Privy Purse slave merchant)
and as a diplomatic contact and peace negotiator with the
Ilkhanid ruler, Abi Sa‘id. Several letters accompanying Mongol
envoys and gifts, and also visits of his own to Cairo are recorded
in the chronicles. A ten year and ten months peace was
concluded in 723/1323.? As for his diplomatic gifts, ‘I have never
seen his like for saying what is felicitous and appropriate’ — to
quote the words of Safadi. He was rewarded with sizeable
commercial privileges and concessions, allowances in money
and kind (presumably when he was in Mamlik territory), said
by Safadi to be near 150 dirhams a day in value, and with the
grant of the village of Arraq, in the district of Baalbek, worth
10,000 dirhams annually.

He possessed a house in Cairo in a street that was called
after him, Darb al-Sallami, and-al-Umari had known him
personally and used him as an informant, questioning him
about Baghdad and Tabriz.’° He died on Wednesday, 7 Jumada
II 743/6 November 1342, having been arrested in the previous
year, Monday, 9 Muharram 742/25 June 1341, not long after the
death of the Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad. He was buried in a
mausoleum that he had built for himself outside the Bab al-Nasr
(Victory Gate).

MAMLUK PERIOD

The Circassian period saw various supplementary endowments
for the Sallamiyya Madrasa, some of the details of which have
been preserved in the Defter no. 522.""' For example, in 831/
1427, a Shaykh Majd al-Din ‘Abd al-Malik b. Abi Bakr al-
Mawsili!? endowed it with a third of the income from various
lands. The other two thirds were to go to his descendants, or
failing that, to be divided into quarters and to be dispensed in
equal portions to the ‘feast’ (simat) provided at the Haram at
Hebron, to the Mansiiri Hospice, the Hospital of Salah al-Din
and the Great Sallamiyya Zawiya.’° A similar division of the
income of another two portions of agricultural land near
Jerusalem, a third to the Sallamiyya Madrasa and two thirds to
his offspring and descendants, was made by the same ‘Abd al-
Malik. His grandson (?), Sadr al-Din b. Ahmad b. ‘Abd al-Malik
al-Mawsili, endowed his offspring and descendants with a
quarter of the village of Bira, which, if they died out, would
benefit equally a zawiya, founded by his ancestors in Damascus,
and the Sallamiyya Madrasa.
 The first of these waqfs, the one dated 831/1427,
envisaged, as far as the Sallamiyya was concerned, the
maintenance of a Koran specialist (15 dirhams monthly) to
instruct six persons daily over a period of two years, in which
they would each receive 7/2 dirhams monthly. There was also
to be a Hadith specialist to recite from the collection of Bukhari
during the months of Rajab, Sha‘ban and Ramadan each Muslim
year, who would receive 20 dirhams a month. Any excess was
to be spent on ‘the Mosul Stfis who assemble to pray for the
benefactor (al-mujtamiin ala awrdd al-waqif)’.

Asali has argued that the Sallamiyya in due course came to
be known as the Mawsiliyya.'* Van Berchem mentioned that in
1893 he had noted a popular name “Musliyya’. He questioned
the value of this information and asked whether it could be a
corruption of ‘Salamiyya’.” It is clear that it should be
understood as a corruption of Mawsiliyya. The change could
have arisen to mark the importance of the supplementary
endowments of the Mawsili family in the early fifteenth century,
or it is possible that there was some built-in preference for
Sifis from the Mosul region (see the mention of Mosul Sufis in
the wagqfiyya of ‘Abd al-Malik, dated 831/1427). We may assume
that there was no intention to found an independent institution
above or behind the Sallamiyya since the waqf of 831/1427 was
stated to be ‘for the good of the Great Sallamiyya Madrasa’. Also
one must note that no Mawsiliyya is recorded in Mujir al-Din,
even though the second endowment of ‘Abd al-Malik al-Mawsili
refers to the Sallamiyya-Mawsiliyya Madrasa. At all events, the
date 831/1427 fits well with that predicated on stylistic grounds
for substantial rebuilding of the upper structures, namely the
decade c.830-40/1426-36.""°

In view of the strong connection with the Mosul region it
is odd that al-Sakhawi records that two members of a family of
North African origin and of Maliki allegiance in law held the
post of shaykh of the Sallamiyya in the fifteenth century. Khalifa
b. Mas‘tid came in 784/1382-83 to settle in Jerusalem and
become imam of the Moroccans’ Mosque in the Haram.""” His
son, Abt ‘Abdallah Muhammad (801-89/1399-1484),'®
succeeded him in that post and was shaykh of the Siifis of the
Abi Madyan Way (an order of Western Islamic origin) in
addition to his headship of the Sallamiyya. In the latter post and
as imam of the Moroccans’ Mosque he was followed by his son,
another Muhammad (851-97/1448-91).'? Although Mujir al-Din
mentions all three persons, he does not record any link with
the Sallamiyya.

OTTOMAN PERIOD

As far as the nomenclature is concerned, the position is
complicated. There exist within the Court records references
to the ‘Sallamiyya Madrasa’ in 968/1561 andas late as 1027/1618.
Both entries concern the leasing of waqf property in Jerusalem,
a stable and a shop.” The only double naming, as in the
wagfiyya abstract, concerns the appointment of a Zayn al-Din
‘Umar to be shaykh and administrator of the Mawsiliyya-
Sallamiyya Madrasa (sic) in 982/1575.”"" All other entries, which
range in date from 947/1540 to 1093/1682, refer to the
Mawsiliyya simply, which in one case, in 1071/1661, is
described as the Mawsiliyya Khangab.”

A schedule of repairs to the ‘Mawsiliyya’, dated 985/1578,”
which were estimated to cost 4,774 paras, mentions ‘the cells
adjoining the Basitiyya . . . three rooms (Aujarat) and three
apartments (buyzit)... the main residence (al-dar al-kabira)
...and the cells in the lower madrasa (al-madrasa al-
tabtaniyya). Does this last phrase relate to the original
Sallamiyya? By about two years later, 3,579 paras had been
spent for work which began early 986/spring 1578.4 Further
repairs were authorised in 1008/1600 at an estimated cost of
2,065 paras, when the cells (al-kbalawi) were mentioned.”

The lands of the ‘Mawsiliyya’ were farmed for the tax year
985/1577-78 to a Jerusalem resident for 40 gold pieces. It is
expressly recorded’® that the income for both the madrasa and
the descendants of the benefactor was covered by this. The
phraseology recalls the division of the income in the wagfiyyas
 of ‘Abd al-Malik al-Mawsili and proves the change of name
conclusively, since the madrasa named originally in those
documents was the Sallamiyya.””

In 1065/1655 the boundaries of a house made waqf for a
daughter by Ishaq al-Lutfi, a member of the family who in the
first century or so of Ottoman rule held positions in the
institution and then control of the waqf,* prove that the
Mawsiliyya then spanned the street to the north.” The house in
question was clearly situated in the vaulting where the Bab al-
‘Atm Street joins the main east — west Mujahidin Street. Its south
boundary was a house in the vault over the side street,
completed by a portion of the Mawsiliyya. The north boundary
was the tomb chamber of the Hanafiyya madrasa, that is the
Mu‘azzamiyya, and to the east was the Mawsiliyya with the street
below it.
 NORTH FRONTAGE (plate 25.1)

The north frontage on to Tariq al-Mujahidin is of
heterogeneous construction. The lower part, which forms the
north boundary of the Sallamiyya, includes many stones with
characteristic Crusader diagonal dressing and masons’ marks.
The consistency of the coursing, colour and texture of this
masonry suggests that these stones are not in secondary use; in
other words, the wall is Crusader. The window design and the
stone dressing indicate that the upper wall is entirely Ottoman
or modern.

Two doorways which are integral features of the Crusader
wall have been blocked.*° Above one of these, at the west end
of this frontage, is a shallow pointed-arched recess with a
sloping sill, which contains the northern window of the
Sallamiyya’s assembly hall (p/ate 25.1). The insertion of the
recess into the pre-existing wall has produced an awkward
conjunction with the lintel of an older doorway below. The
other blocked doorway is 23m to the east (see below, p. 305).

In the upper part of the Crusader wall may be seen four
small windows which light a corridor behind the wall. Four
springings for vaults, which evidently spanned or were
intended to span Tariq al-Mujahidin, survive at regular intervals
in the two uppermost remaining courses of the western half of
the Crusader wall. There is nothing to correspond with these
springings on the opposite (northern) side of the street, which
is formed partly by the south wall of the Ayyubid Mu‘azzamiyya
Madrasa (614/1217-18), and so it may be inferred that either the
vaulting over the street was demolished before the
construction of the Mu‘azzamiyya or, alternatively, it was never
completed.
 WEST FACADE (fig. 25.5)

The west facade on Tariq Bab al-‘Atm is the only external wall
of Mamlik construction. Its northern part is somewhat
obscured by later vaults spanning the street. The entrance
portal and part of the wall south of it are unencumbered by
later vaults and stand at the only part of the street to remain
open to the sky. The most distinctive decorative features are
concentrated on this west facade and since we are obliged to
depend on stylistic analysis of these features to establish our
dating criteria, they are worthy of special attention.

The facade is-divided into two unequal lengths of 13.72m
and 3.44m respectively by the monumental portal unit, which
presents a front of 5.97m including a frame moulding, and a
height of 7.80m to the original cornice. The total length of the
facade is therefore 23.13m. The short length to the right of the
entrance is plain apart from two very small windows admitting
light to the staircase giving access to the roof. The other length,
left of the entrance, is relieved by three shallow recesses,
evenly spaced, which contain grilled windows of the assembly
hall. The head of the central recess has four tiers of angular
muqarnas corbelling while the two lateral recesses have three-
tiered curvilinear muqarnas heads. The use of angular
muqarnas is significant: this is the only known occurrence in
Bahri Mamluk Jerusalem and, as we shall see, is a valuable clue
in the dating process. The decoration below the mugqarnas
corbelling is similar in each case: the sills of the recesses slope
at an angle of approximately 45°; the window jambs are of red
and cream-coloured ablag; and above the plain monolithic
lintels are panels of joggled ablaq revetment simulating flat
relieving arches.

The monumental entrance portal (plate 25.2) is framed by
a quirked ogee moulding (fig. 25.5) which extends inwards to
frame stone benches on either side of the portal recess. The
deep recess (2.85m wide and 2.41m deep) is covered by a
horizontally developed mugarnas system with pendent
elements, like a stalactite canopy (plate 25.3)2"" This distinctive
stalactite canopy is the crucial element in the dating process
(see below). Within the frame moulding up to the height of
springing of the stalactite canopy the portal is constructed in
red and cream-coloured ablag. The canopy and the
surrounding stonework are constructed in the usual ‘malaki’
limestone, which has taken a beautiful amber tint. The
stalactites are badly weathered now. Since no amount of
stereotomical ingenuity could keep them naturally in place
they are tied back to the superstructure of the canopy by eight
 judiciously placed iron nails with wide heads. Even so, the
canopy has sagged in places and now sparrows nest in
interstices between the stones.

The recess is paved with a massive slab of limestone
surrounded by a black stone border. The entrance doorway,”
which opens in the rear wall of the recess, is surmounted by a
lintel fronted with pseudo-voussoirs of ablaq*? like the pseudo-
relieving arches over the windows. The outer face of this
revetment is set approximately four centimetres back from the
surrounding masonry within a narrow frame moulding. The
lintel rests on, shoulders decorated with three tiers of
mugarnas. A relieving arch, separated from the lintel by one
course of red stonework, is functional in this case, albeit
fronted with pseudo-voussoirs as well. Two square frames, one
at either end of the relieving arch, enclose circular medallions
each linked to its frame by four circlets inlaid with red-
coloured stone (fig. 25.6). The medallions are inscribed with
the Muslim confession of faith: ‘There is no God but Allah’ (in
the right-hand one) and ‘Muhammad is the Apostle of God’ (in
the left-hand one).*4 A sunken band, evidently intended for an
inscription which has never been carved, runs round the portal
recess under the stalactite canopy and extends across the
frontage where it is closed at each end by pointed, bow-shaped
ansae with palmette terminals.

The original iron-plated double doors and heavy iron
knockers are still in use (plate 25.4). Iron nails with lozenge
shaped heads, arranged according to a hexagonal grid with
gibbous ribbed-headed nails in the centres of the hexagons, fix
the horizontal iron bands to the timber frames. The iron bands
are carried round the sides of the door leaves and nailed to the
timber stiles. Two wooden panels of geometric ornament are
all that survive of the decoration of the inner faces of the doors
(plate 25.5). The leaves turn on spindles located in the usual
fashion in sockets in the paving behind the threshhold and in
the springers of a segmental arch behind the lintel.

The constructions over the entrance portal (shown in Sig.
25.5) are difficult to assess. A vertical joint in the masonry above
the top right-hand corner of the portal is evidence of two
phases of construction. This is confirmed by the colour and
texture of the masonry. The greyish stonework of the structure
directly over the entrance portal is quite different from the
masonry of the lower facade, while at least the lower masonry
courses of the adjoining structure to the south appear to match
those of the facade below.

The southern structure incorporates the remains of a
 balcony (now partly obscured by the later vaults spanning the
street) framed by a quirked ogee moulding and supported on
carved brackets, one of which is still visible (plate 25.6). The
fact that the moulding framing the balcony is identical to the
one framing the portal is a good indication that the two are
contemporaneous. The interior of the room which opens onto
the balcony is square in plan and roofed with a shallow domical
vault (plate 25.7), a feature generally associated with buildings
of the Ottoman period in Jerusalem, but the vault might have
been rebuilt. Indeed, some remodelling must have been done
when the balcony was encroached upon by the later structures
spanning the street. At any rate it seems likely that originally
there was a single room within the balcony.

The date of the structure directly above the entrance portal
is hard to say. The vertical joint in the masonry shows that it
cannot be contemporaneous with the adjoining room
discussed above, and the colour and the texture of the
stonework seem to indicate that it is not part of the original
foundation. Its small triple window composed of twin round-
headed windows surmounted by a circular oculus (see fig.
25.5) offers a clue, however: only two other examples of this
feature are known to us in Jerusalem and both are dated to the
fourth decade of the ninth/fifteenth century.** Consequently, in
the absence of more substantial evidence, we might tentatively
date this upper floor structure to the same decade, i.e. 830-40/
1426-36. Here too there are signs of what may be a later
remodelling of the upper fabric; the stone-paved dome appears
to be Ottoman for it has no drum but simply rises directly from
the adjoining roof. Unfortunately it has not been possible to
enter to inspect the interior of this part of the building.

GROUND FLOOR (fig. 25.3)

The entrance doorway leads into a lofty cross-vaulted vestibule,
beautifully constructed in dressed stone and lit by a small
window high in the east wall. A stone bench runs around the
north and east walls. The paved floor is level with the paving of
the portal recess; a monolithic sill 0.12m high separates the
two.

From the south side of the vestibule a pointed arch opens
into a short tunnel-vaulted passage (plate 25.8) leading east
into the courtyard. A door in the south wall of this passage
belongs to a small cell lit by a slit window at the south-west
corner of the courtyard. This cell has been annexed to the
adjoining cell to the east. A cloister-vaulted recess at the west
end of the passage has a door in its south wall giving access to
 a small dark compartment at the foot of the staircase leading to
the roof (described below).

The original height of the west wall of the courtyard is
given by a short section of moulded cornice (visible in plate
25.9), while another section similarly preserved at the same
height in the east wall suggests that the cornice originally
extended around all four sides.

The plan (fig. 25.3) shows the arrangement of twelve cells
around three sides of the courtyard: three on the south side, six
on the east and three on the north. The entrance vestibule and
assembly hall occupy the fourth, west side. Each cell has the
usual pointed-arched doorway with a slit window above (apart
from the door of the annexed cell in the south-west corner,
which has been converted into a window and paired with a
similar window (see plate 25.10)). A staircase against the
eastern range of cells is a later, Ottoman addition; it completely
blocks one door and partly blocks another.

The doorway into the corridor at the north-east corner of
the courtyard (plate 25.11) is different from those of the cells;
it is larger, spanned by a flat lintel surmounted by a relieving
arch. A slit window above the relieving arch has a small trefoil
head. The door opening has been narrowed with a pile of loose
stones and a new lintel inserted under the original one. The
corridor runs northwards for about two metres before turning
east where it is lit by the windows set high in the street wall

eS Th ae ee)
 (above, p. 301). These windows are accommodated by
excisions in the tunnel vault. The corridor is piled high with
rubble and progress is only possible by crouching in the
confined space under the vault itself. At a distance of roughly
thirteen metres from the entrance, the pile of rubble ends
abruptly in a sheer drop and a ladder is needed to descend to
a small vestibule behind the blocked street door (mentioned
above, p. 301). Before it was blocked this door must have given
access through the corridor to the courtyard of the madrasa.
Beyond the vestibule the corridor continued eastwards but a
modern staircase, reinforced with concrete, has been added; it
rises in three narrow flights within the width of the original
corridor to come out among the Ottoman buildings at first
floor level. The homogeneity of construction of the Crusader
street wall (the northern boundary of the madrasa) and the
tunnel-vaulted corridor shows that the two are
contemporaneous.

In the centre of the southern wall of the courtyard a tall
recess houses a well-head where water was once drawn froma
cistern — it is no longer used, having been superseded first by
a second well-head in the middle of the courtyard and latterly
by mains water supply. The recess remains, however, a
noteworthy architectural feature (plate 25.10): behind a
hoodmould over the recessed voussoirs of a pointed arch is an
unusual stone vault. This little vault (fig. 25.7) springs from
three points: the centre of the rear wall of the recess and the
two internal springing points of the pointed arch. The
triangular vaulting pattern thus formed encloses a hexagonal
cupola with a central pendent muqarnas element identical to
the cupola over the inner porch at Bab al-Nazir (plate 35.3)
which was built in 707/1307-8.

In the west wall of the courtyard a group of three pointed-
 Fig. <0.9 lariq Gab al- Atm: Elevation of east side

arched recesses originally emphasized the facade of the
assembly hall.

Now an Ottoman double vault in front of the north wall of
the courtyard conceals the upper part of the two northern
recesses but the southern recess remains unobstructed (see
plate 25.9); its relatively simple decoration consists of one
course of ablaq joggling over the window lintel and ablaq
window jambs.

The central recess houses the entrance door and is
somewhat wider than the flanking recesses (both of which
originally held windows) though to judge from the visible
remains all three rose to the same height. Now that a modern
partition divides the interior of the assembly hall, the window
in the northern recess has been converted into a second door.

The floor of the assembly hall is approximately one metre
higher than the level of the courtyard. The ceiling is vaulted in
three bays with a small octagonal stone cupola (plate 25.12) at
the crown of the central folded cross vault. The hall must

the three western windows are now blocked.

UPPER FLOORS

The staircase in the south-west corner of the building, covered
by a rising tunnel vault, makes three flights round a central core
in rising to the roof over the southern range of cells. It is rather
badly lit since there are only the two slit windows opening on
the street, one at the first landing and the other at the second,
though some light does filter down from an open doorway at
the top. About half-way up the third flight is the door of a
curious mezzanine room which is dimly lit by a window
Opening in the upper part of the south wall of the entrance
vestibule, immediately below the vault (fig. 25.4). The staircase
evidently existed originally to provide access to this mezzanine
as well as to the roof-tops around the courtyard and possibly
the upper floor room with the balcony (above, p. 302).
 DATE OF CONSTRUCTION
Mujir al-Din (cited above, p. 299) states that ‘I have not been
able to discover the date of its foundation. It appears that it was
after 700 (1300)’. He does not give his reason for proposing
‘after 700’. The construction must have been before 743/1342
when the founder, al-Majd al-Sallami, died. In order to date it
more closely we must rely on the architectural evidence.

Several features on the west facade suggest a pronounced
Egyptian influence on the design: the tall, rectangular window
recesses with mugqarnas heads and sloping sills; the angular
mugqarnas system itself; the sunken panel or ‘inscription band’
extending onto the facade with ansa and palmette terminals;
the recessed door lintel with joggled revetment; the roundels
on either side of the relieving arch over the lintel; 36 and the flat
stalactite canopy. All these features belong to a specifically
Cairene repertoire. It is therefore to the architecture of Cairo
that we must turn for stylistic parallels.

Van Berchem observed that the remarkable architectural
style of the Sallamiyya betrays an early eighth/fourteenth

 century date of construction.*’ Indeed, the first five features
listed above are prevalent in the Mamluk architecture of Cairo
from the beginning of that century. But the sixth, the flat
stalactite canopy, can be dated more precisely. The earliest
Cairene parallel to the specially deep recess of the Sallamiyya
portal covered with a flat stalactite canopy is the entrance portal
at the Mosque of Almas (730/1330).** Moreover, the fashion for
such deep stalactite canopies was relatively short-lived. There
are only three other close parallels known to me: the portals at
the Mosque of Bashtak (736/1336) (plate 23) the Palace of
Bashtak (738/1337-38)°° and the ‘Palace of Yushbak’ (built for
Qawsin c.738/1337).*°

Thus by comparison with the Cairene monuments we
arrive at an approximate range of dates between 730/1330 and
738/1338. The actual date of construction of the Sallamiyya
probably belongs rather to the end of that decade, say c.738/
1338, when the special vaulting technique had been practised
in Cairo for some time (see above, p. 99).

TWO BUILDING TEAMS?

The characteristically Egyptian features outlined above are to
be found only on the west facade. There is nothing comparable
in the interior. The pointed-arched recesses and folded cross
vault of the assembly hall, and the little mugarnas cupola over
the well recess are typically Syrian. We have already remarked
that this cupola is identical to the cupola of the eastern porch at
Bab al-Nazir (707/1307-8). A similar feature, though in a
modified form to suit the particular structural requirements of
a portal vault, is to be found in Jerusalem also in the mugarnas
corbelling of the entrance portal at the Tankiziyya (no. 18).

And so it would appear that the construction might have
been undertaken by two teams of builders: a local Syrian team
who built the bulk of the structure, and a team of Egyptian
specialists sent from Cairo to erect the facade.

The privilege of having a special team sent from Cairo to
work on the Sallamiyya may have been by favour of the sultan.
The literary sources include many references to al-Nasir
Muhammad’s frequent contributions of various kinds,
including builders and architects, to the building works of his
amirs in Cairo.*’ It has been noted above (p. 299) that al-Majd
al-Sallami was a very important merchant who was responsible
for buying mamliuks for al-Nasir Muhammad, and one might
speculate that he too benefited in this way.”

42 The Sallamiyya appears to be the only Bahri Mamlik foundation in Jerusalem
to have been built partly by craftsmen from Egypt. Later on, towards the end of the
Circassian Mamlik period, three monuments were built in Jerusalem in a
distinctly Egyptian style: the Zamani Ribat (881/1476-77), the Muzhiriyya (885/
1480-81) and the Ashrafivya (887/1482).

The architectural fabric of the building stands virtually as it was
first erected — an exceptional circumstance in Jerusalem where
sO many medieval monuments have been remodelled when
converted into dwellings.

The madrasa is built entirely above the level of the Haram
portico. A staircase situated at the western limit of the main
building leads up from the Haram esplanade to the main
entrance and also serves the Is‘ardiyya. The entrance portal
faces west and is elaborately decorated.

The internal layout may conveniently be considered as a
combination of two interconnected units: a southern unit
consisting of an assembly hall overlooking the Haram; and a
northern unit composed ofa square courtyard, open to the sky,
surrounded by two tiers of cells including a tomb chamber. The
roof of the northern unit is level with the roof of the southern
unit; in other words, the high vault of the assembly hall rises to
more or less the same height as the two storeys of cells around
the courtyard. There is no mibrab.

Al-‘Umari saw the building just a few years after its completion
and described its position above the Haram portico at its
continuation westwards from the present Bab al-‘Atm and
mentioned the stairs there, leading to the Almalikiyya and the
Is‘ardiyya.* The foundation inscription of the Almalikiyya is still
in situ on the south-facing facade. Mujir al-Din knew it —‘on the
southern wall {of the madrasa] above the north portico of the
Masjid al-Aqsa [i.e. the Haram’ — and quoted from it3

DATE
The text of the extant inscription is as follows:4

In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate. The
construction of this blessed place was made as an offering
by the servant needful of God Almighty, al-Hajj [the
pilgrim] Almalik al-Jakandar [the Bearer of the Polo-stick],
the servant of al-Malik al-Nasir (may God pardon him in
life and in death, and also those who pray for mercy and
forgiveness for him). It was completed in God's month,
Muharram, the beginning of the year seven hundred and
forty-one from the Hijra of the Prophet (the best of
blessings and greetings be upon him).
 Mujir al-Din interpreted the date of completion
unambiguously as 1 Muharram 741/27 June 1340.
 Mujir al-Din interpreted the date of completion
unambiguously as 1 Muharram 741/27 June 1340.

FOUNDER

Almalik was acquired by Baybars I as part of the booty of the
battle of Elbistan in 676/1277. Qalawiin, while still an amir,
purchased him and presented him to his son-in-law, al-Sa‘id
Barka Khan. He passed through the hands of an amir of the
latter, called Kundak, and then came into the possession of ‘Ali,
the son of Qalawiin, who died in 687/1288.° The famous
traveller, Ibn Battiita, met Almalik in 726/1326, when the amir
was camped with his troop outside a zawiya at Fuwwa in the
Delta, and describes him as one of the kbdssakiyya, the intimate
retinue, of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad.° By 739/1338-39 he was
an amir of 100.’ He held the court post of Bearer of the Polo-
stick, the appropriate arms for which are exhibited on his
foundation in Jerusalem, finished just over nine months before
the sultan’s death.®

For a brief while in the reign of al-Nasir Ahmad he left
Cairo to serve as governor of Hama (Dhii’l-Qa‘da 742/April
1342), but he was recalled by al-Salih Isma‘il and appointed
Viceroy of Egypt (Muharram 744/June 1343).? In addition to the
normal iqta‘ for this position he was given the two districts of
Matariyya and Khusis, the annual yield of which was 450,000
dirhams.!°

Various strict ‘puritan’ measures made him enemies
among the amirs.'' He was also opposed to the party that
pressed for the succession of Sha‘ban, as the illness of his
brother, al-Salih, became apparent. Al-Salih died in Rabi II 746/
August 1345. Al-Kamil Sha‘ban succeeded and that was the end
of Almalik’s short-lived pre-eminence.'? He quickly sought, and
was allowed, to exchange positions with the governor of
Damascus, but even while he was making his way there, he was
demoted to the governorship of Safad."" Soon he found himself
accused of plotting and disaffection. Summoned to Cairo, he
was arrested in Dhil-Hijja 746/April 1346 at Gaza, and
eventually sent to prison in Alexandria.""

His possessions were seized, including 75,000 dirhams,
4,000 dinars and 30,000 ardebs of grain. His family shared his
fall, and his corps of mamliks was broken up and divided
amongst other amirs.!> Ibn Hajar says that he was executed
(strangled according to one source) either at the end of 746 or
at the beginning of 747. The dates given are many and various
but it is hardly surprising in the circumstances. '°

His son, Shihab al-Din Ahmad, spent some time in prison
and lost 100,000 dirhams, but did not remain in disgrace. Ina

the autumn of 1373 and the spring of the following year he
moved from the governorship of Gaza to the post of
Superintendent of the Two Harams, then to that of a minor
chamberlain in Cairo.'® He resigned in July 1377, gave up his
amirate and turned to religion, living on the proceeds of his
father’s endowments until his death in May 1391.""

Almalik’s nephew, who initially shared some of his fate,
was the Amir IIbaki, the founder of the Farisiyya (see p. 337).

There is nothing to connect Almalik’s career with
Jerusalem, nor any mention in any source of his building there.
His strictness has been mentioned already, and his preference
for the society of the learned and his own scholarship are
remarked upon. He was the founder of two religious
institutions in Cairo. One was a madrasa near the Shrine of
Husayn, which he endowed for the instruction of Shafi‘
lawyers and furnished with a large library. The madrasa was still
important in Maqrizi’s time, but then became a residence for a
son-in-law of al-Salih.”° The other was a mosque (jami‘) in the
suburb of al-Husayniyya outside the Bab al-Nasr, which was
opened in Jumada I 732/December 1331.72 In 745/1344-45
Almalik had an aqueduct built at Mina in the Hijaz.”

ENDOWMENT

As we have seen, the inscription unequivocally attributes the
construction of the madrasa to Almalik. The question of the
endowment is not clear. This is what Mujir al-Din has to say:

Its endowment came from his wife, Ay-malak, the daughter
of Qutluqtimur al-Nasiri, and the date of the endowment
was 16 Rabi’ II 745/27 August 1344. Apparently her
husband built it for her with her money, but God knows
best.

The Defter 602 dates the wagfiyya to this same year and
attributes it clearly to Ay-malak, and adds that the madrasa is
known after her.* The defter published by Ipsirli, no. 522,
confuses the names of husband and wife, something which it is
very easy to do in the Arabic script, and assigns the endowment
to Almalik, daughter of Qutluqtimur.” The wife, Ay-malak,
must have been intended. However, this latter defter gives the
date of the waqfiyya as 757/1356, which further complicates the
matter. Indulging in pure speculation one may wonder
whether the endowment of 745/1344 was not in truth Almalik’s,
That year saw the acme of his power and influence, and we have
seen that one charitable undertaking is dated to it. Then, after
his fall and the temporary eclipse of his family, it was necessary
to re-endow his madrasa in Jerusalem, and this was done by his
wife in 757/1356. Confusion arose later from the similarity in
names.

Nevertheless, there is one further piece of evidence which
it is difficult to fit into our reconstruction of events. In the Aqsa
Library there is a list of waqfs in favour of the Haram at Hebron,
which was probably drawn up in the early sixteenth century.
One tenth of the village of Dayr Bazi‘° which is elsewhere
claimed in full as the endowment of the Almalikiyya, is listed as
a waqf of ‘Ay-malak, the daughter of Qutlugtimur al-Silahdar’
on behalf of the Hebron Sanctuary.?” This would strongly
suggest that she was also the source of the benefaction for the
madrasa, whatever the truth about the division of the income.
But what do we make of the date given for this waqf, 16 Rajab
746/12 November 1345? It is somewhat over a year later than
the first date recorded for the waqf of the madrasa and six
months or so before the fall and execution of her husband. It is
prudent, in the absence of any copies of the wadfiyya or
wadfiyyas, to leave the facts such as they are, to speak for
themselves and to repeat Mujir al-Din’s ‘but God knows best’.

The resources for the madrasa which are recorded in the
defters were as follows: the complete (but see above) village of
Dayr Bazi’, a shop at the Chain Gate in Jerusalem and several
properties in Gaza, namely a caravanserai, seven shops and
four store-rooms (makbhazin).8
 PYUDIILYULLAV EL £4LGS MNS
The foundation inscription refers only to ‘this blessed place’.
Although al-‘Umari within a few years writes only ofa ‘madrasa’,
it is clear that the neutral ‘place’ meant a complex which
included a separate ribat for women and also a tomb chamber.
Three Haram documents deal with the registration of the
effects of residents in the ribat. All three were Turkish ladies,
and it is fascinating to find that one, in 795/1393, is described as
‘the freedwoman of the Lady Ay-malak bint Qutluqtimur al-
Nasiri’, who, incidentally, is not explicitly said to be ‘the
late...°° This is another example of dependants enjoying
‘grace and favour’ residence.

An account of the expenditure of waqf income from Dayr
Bazi’ for the tax year 939/1532-33 mentions the beneficiaries,
including several members of the Ibn Jaméa‘a family, through
their functions in the madrasa, and then notes a small sum
destined ‘for Fatima al-Yamaniyya personally and the rest of the
old women (‘@ja’iz) resident with her in the hospice’.* A report
(1018/1609) on the state of the madrasa and ‘its ribat next to it
to the north’, apart from completely non-explicit items, refers
to ‘the ivan in the ribat’ and ‘improving the ribat stairs,
renewing the doors of some of the rooms and repairing the
entrance (bab) of the ribat’, all at a cost of 1,990 paras.*! A
similar later report (1072/1661) lists repairs estimated to cost
185 Asadi piastres. Parts said to be in a ruined state were ‘the
southern wall dividing the Almalikiyya Madrasa from the
Farisiyya’ (sic!) and — and this is the only mention of it — ‘the
turba which is in the madrasa’.** The Amir Almalik was buried
in his mosque in Cairo.* Although there is no positive
evidence, it seems reasonable to assume that the cenotaph in
the tomb chamber contains the mortal remains of the Lady Ay-
malak.

The names of several persons who held positions in the
madrasa are given by Asali.*4 Some of them, as he suggests,
were surely only nominal apppointments. They were mostly
Shafi‘ite in allegiance, which indicates that the madrasa was
founded with that law school in mind, as was the case with
Almalik’s comparable institution in Cairo. However, confusion
arises in Arabic from the similarity of the name of the madrasa
(Almalikiyya) to the plural noun meaning ‘lawyers of the Maliki
school’ (al-Malikiyya). Hence there is no need to worry how
Ibn Batttita could have met Abu ‘Abdallah Muhammad al-
Gharnati and called him the mudarris of the Almalikiyya in 726/
1326 before the Almalikiyya existed. The scholar he met in
Jerusalem was ‘the leading teacher of the Malikis (mudarris al-
Malikiyya)*° and therefore likely to have been attached to the
Afdaliyya Madrasa, also known as the Dome (al-Qubba) in the
Moroccans’ Quarter, which had been endowed by al-Afdal, the
son of Saladin, for the Malikis.*° The same phrase applied to
another Maliki scholar, who died in about 750/1349, ‘Abdallah
b. Sulayman b. ‘Abdallah al-Ansari.3” However, one must take
into account the case of Siraj al-Din ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-Rahman, a
Hanbali scholar (died 755/1354), who was ‘shaykh of the
Almalikiyya in Jerusalem’. If we accept the reading ‘shaykh of
the Malikis (Malikiyya), then we have an even odder
statement.*®
 "
27,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","HARAM PORTICO (figs. 26.3 and 26.6, plate 26.1)

Mujir al-Din states that the portico under the Almalikiyya was
rebuilt when the madrasa was constructed. The composite
masonry of the portico shows how it was rebuilt. Of the last four
piers at the western end of the earlier portico (see above, p.
107) the westernmost survives, another has been replaced and
the two flanking its replacement were incorporated into new
massive piers built to support the madrasa. These sloping-
topped composite piers extend upwards to form buttresses
framing the madrasa’s main facade. That the pier between them
replaces an earlier one may be deduced from the distance
between the centres of the earlier parts of the flanking piers,
 Plate <0.< Foundation inscription with tanking blazons Ot juKanaar

9.28m, which is double the average ‘pitch’ of the rest of the
earlier portico. Above that intermediate pier the foundation
inscription and flanking blazons of the Jakandar (plate 26.2)
were inserted when the madrasa was completed.

The westernmost bay of this portico now supports part of
the Is‘ardiyya (no. 33) but its roof must initially have been
unbuilt on, forming a forecourt to the main entrance in the west
wall of the Almalikiyya. Against the end of that westernmost bay
Tises an entrance staircase (plate 26.1). It leads to a small
landing from where one flight continues to the Is‘ardiyya and
another branches eastward to the entrance of the Almalikiyya
 (plate 26.3). The masonry above the staircase entrance differs
from that of the portico (see fig. 26.6), suggesting that the rising
tunnel vault covering the staircase was concomitant with the
construction of the Is‘ardiyya.

HARAM FACADE (fig. 26.6, plate 26.1)

The facade of the Almalikiyya is framed by the two buttresses
that extend upwards from the supporting piers. In this way the
frontage of the madrasa is integrated with the portico below to
form an impressive two-storey facade. The conjunction of the
two storeys is articulated by a moulded string course. At the top
of the facade a two-tiered mu:quarnas canopy surmounted bya
cornice moulding which extended between the buttresses
(plate 26.4) was largely destroyed between 1893 and 1914 by
vegetation rooted in the interstices between the stones.*?

Between the flanking buttresses under the muqarnas
canopy the facade is 0.25m in recess. It is built of red and cream-
coloured ablag. A large, grilled rectangular window in the
centre of the main facade is flanked by lower, narrower grilled
windows and surmounted by an oculus. These windows
belong to the assembly hall. A shallow moulding (fig. 10f)
surrounds the ablaq relieving arches of the two flanking
windows and extends over the lintel of the central window,
above which it turns in a tight loop before encircling the ablaq
radial voussoirs of the oculus (plate 26.1). Several voussoirs
and part of the moulding around the oculus were restored and
the masonry of the facade repointed in 1982.

A broad string course, slightly recessed, runs across the
main facade above the oculus onto the face of the flanking
buttresses. There it terminates in a decorative manner,
interlocking with the adjoining masonry in a joggled joint
which extends vertically to define the ends of narrow red-
coloured stone courses above and below the recessed
course(plate 26.4).

The Haram frontage includes a short projection to the west
beyond the western buttress. Here there are two windows
placed one above the other; the lower window is small and
rectangular, the upper larger and arched. The masonry of the
upper part of the buttress extends west on the same plane to
form the jambs and pointed arch of the upper window (fig.
26.6). The sill of this window is a projecting slab spanning
between the buttress and a single corbel on the west side. The
wall below the sill has been set back 0.35m from the face of the
buttress in an apparent effort to avoid disrupting the symmetry
of the facade. The west wall is concealed by the Is‘ardiyya, built
hard against the madrasa.

ENTRANCE (plates 26.3 and 26.5)
The entrance proper to the madrasa is on the cramped upper

) PaaS PER Re ay eS ges pert e aed 1G Tomy Bain SRS PORN R RENN Rs Siw ee Bee CREE an EO
 adjacent Is‘ardiyya, forms a tiny patio open to the sky. The
doorway is ornamentally developed, set in a tall, narrow recess
with a mugarnas hood. Its red monolithic lintel is set back
slightly, supported on moulded brackets and edged with a
simple border which continues upwards to frame a roundel
composed of ten joggled ablaq voussoirs in the form of an
oculus. Four of the voussoirs are badly eroded, revealing the
superficial nature of the joggling. The roundel is set back on the
same plane as the lintel and surrounded by a raised border
inscribed within the square frame. Each of the four corners
between the square frame and the circular border is
emblazoned with the paired polo-sticks of the jakandar
intaglioed in the grey stone veneer as if to receive a paste
filling.

The hood consists of three tiers of curvilinear mugarnas
culminating in two small conchs with stubby stalactite elements
at their apexes. Above the uppermost tier of muqarnas runs a
horizontal moulding identical in profile to (but at a lower level
than) the cornice moulding which complements the Haram
facade.

The narrowness of the entrance portal suggests that the
space available for it was restricted. To the north (see plan, Jig.
 20.4) lies part of the four-metres thick wall associated with the
Tower Antonia (above, p. 204), which would have formed an
effective boundary. But what the wall forming the southern
boundary belonged to is not at all clear. The room beyond it is
part of the Is‘ardiyya, which must have been built after the
Almalikiyya.

VESTIBULE

The entrance door opens into a dark vestibule connecting with
both the assembly hall and, by way of an intermediate chamber
with a window opening into the tomb chamber, a tunnel-
vaulted cell at the south-west corner of the courtyard.

ASSEMBLY HALL (fig. 26.4)

The assembly hall overlooks the Haram through three
windows constructed in ablaq masonry whose coursing
matches that of the exterior facade (plate 26.9). The soffits of
the two lateral window embrasures are of stucco carved with an
arrangement of stalactites around two eight-pointed stars
enclosing rosettes; both are identical except that the rosettes in
the western soffit are composed of sixteen radial petals, while
those in the eastern one (plate 26.6) have sixteen whorled
 petals. The soffit of the central window is undecorated, but the
sill is inlaid with polychrome marble strapwork (plate 26.7),
absent in the lateral windows.

The oculus above the central window is ringed by a
decorative inlay of six intersecting circles of black stone cut off
by the central opening to form six interlaced lobes (fig. 26.7).""!
The mason responsible for this decoration may have copied it
from analogous eight-lobed designs on two earlier monuments
in Damascus, the Zahiriyya Madrasa (676/1277)” and the
Takritiyya Turba (c.698/1299).* Extra light was admitted to the
hall by a domed octagonal lantern at the crown of the high
folded cross vault. The eight pointed-arched windows of the
lantern have been blocked and the roof repaved with the result
that all but the tops of the arches are concealed (fig. 26.8 shows
the lantern as it must have looked before the repaving of the
roof). The dome appears to be constructed of ablaq masonry
unusually arranged in spiralling courses, visible on the interior
(fig. 26.7, plate 26.8). The exterior is cement-rendered.

Transverse arches springing from muqarnas imposts span
the east and west ends of the hall. With the exception of the
ablaq-decorated south wall, the walls and vaulting of the hall
are plastered.
 In the south-west corner a narrow door opens into a small
vaulted room with a window overlooking the Haram. A recess
in the west wall of this room may originally have been a
window which was subsequently blocked by the adjoining
Is‘ardiyya. At the north wall of the hall the marble jambs and
lintel of a blocked window protrude through the plaster; this
window originally opened into the tomb chamber (see below).
In the centre of the north wall, a door with exposed ablaq

jambs leads into a short passageway connecting the hall with
the courtyard.

COURTYARD

The layout of the cells around the courtyard is shown on the
plan (fig. 26.4). There are doors opening off the courtyard at
both ends of each of the four enclosing walls (plate 26.10), and
in addition there is one (see plate 26.11) in the centre of the
southern wall (connecting with the assembly hall) and one in
the centre of the north wall (opening into a small cell). To
enhance the symmetrical disposition, blind doors (plate 26.12)
imitating the others have been added at the centre of the west
and east walls. The horseshoe arches of the doorways have
ablaq voussoirs of alternately red and cream-coloured stone
 Fig. 26.7 East—west section through assembly hall looking
south

set back slightly within a chamfered frame cut in the
surrounding masonry. Slit windows with chamfered jambs and
delicately cusped heads are placed directly above the doors.

The tunnel-vaulted tomb chamber at the south-west
corner contains a marble-clad cenotaph set on a low plinth.
Three corners of the cenotaph are fitted with stumpy marble
pillars which have typical Mamlik pointed bulbous finials; the
fourth pillar has disappeared. The tomb chamber originally
had openings on all four sides. The windows in the south and
west walls of the tomb chamber have been referred to above;
the door from the courtyard, which is original, is in the north
wall. Only the east wall is blank, but it is a later infilling.

The cell at the south-east corner has a small window in its
eastern wall admitting light from the light-well at the head of
the entrance staircase of the contiguous Farisiyya.

Acourse of foundations (marked by a thin line on the plan,
Jig. 26.4) in the cell at the the southern end of the west wall may
be a trace of the Antonia (above, p. 43) of which more
substantial remains have been isolated in the Is‘ardiyya and the
Jawiliyya Madrasa (no. 14).

A long, dark corridor extends eastwards from the north-
€ast corner of the courtyard and then turns north up to what is
 now a raised garden outside the northern limits of the madrasa.
Two northern chambers are entered off this corridor. A low
opening in the wall separating these two vaulted chambers
houses a well-head opening into a cistern. The western
chamber has in its north wall a blocked doorway which,
according to the present occupant of the building, once led to
a series of vaulted rooms under the garden. These rooms may
belong to the ribat mentioned above (p. 310) which was
situated to the north of the madrasa. A doorway (marked ‘X’ on
the plan) just to the right of the door from the corridor into the
garden (plate 26.13) also may be associated with that ribat. Its
cloister vault is partly rebuilt. The area beyond the door was not
accessible to us.

The walls of the corridor are unplastered but show no
trace of a door to the south, where our survey has revealed a
large square-shaped structure with no apparent entrance. Its
irregular orientation governs the alignment of the eastern
boundary of that part of the madrasa which abuts on it, and
therefore it must have existed before the construction of the
madrasa. Yet the masonry of the south wall of the corridor is
small and continuous, not unlike that of the north wall. It may
mark the site of some fortification connected with the Tower
 Antonia but in the absence of further evidence its function and
history remain a mystery.

UPPER FLOOR (fig. 26.5)

A staircase to the upper rooms of the madrasa is reached from
the courtyard by the same doorway that gives access to the
corridor. This staircase rises southward along the west side of
the mysterious structure described above. At upper floor level
a gallery projects over the west, north and east walls of the
courtyard, supported on handsome carved stone consoles of
two types arranged alternately (plate 26.10).

The rooms at this level are laid out in much the same way
as those on the lower level. The assembly hall rises the full
height of both storeys. The most noticeable difference is a long
vaulted chamber which runs parallel with the north wall of the
assembly hall, and a narrow southward extension of it parallel
with the west wall of the assembly hall. That long chamber and
its southern extension have small windows pierced in,
 respectively, their south and east walls looking into the
assembly hall at roughly the same high level as the oculus in the
south wall of that hall (see plate 26.14). In addition, the long
chamber has two windows facing north, while the southern
extension has a small window in its west wall, opening on the
light-well over the entrance portal, and a pointed-arched
window at its southern end (plate 26.15) overlooking the
Haram (see above, p. 311).

On the north and west sides of the courtyard there are at
this level six cells, four entered from the northern gallery and
two from the western gallery. In the north-west cell, entered
from the western gallery, the rear wall has been breached to
establish a connection with the adjoining cell to the west, which
is part of the Is‘ardiyya (plate 26.16).

Isolated at the north-east corner of the complex are two

domed rooms (plate 26.17) which house a kitchen and a
latrine.
 Notes

1 The transcription of Mamlak names from the ‘original’ Turkish into Arabic
tended to produce a variety of divergent forms (J.M. Rogers, ‘The name Qawsiin’
in Layla ‘Ali Ibrahim, ‘The great Hanqah of the Emir Qawstin in Cairo’, MDIK, xxx,
1974, 57-60). Almalik is sucha case. Van Berchem first transliterated it as ‘Al-malik’
(CIA (Le Caire), 170-71) and later as ‘Yl-malak’ (CIA (Ville), 267). Subsequently L.A.
Mayer argued in favour of ‘Almalik’ (Saracenic Heraldry, Oxford, 1933, 60). In
Ahmad Zaki’s edition of al-‘Umari, Masdlik, ‘Almalik’, the spelling we have
adopted here, is used, while Mujir al-Din calls him simply ‘Malik’ and refers to his
madrasa in Jerusalem as ‘al-Malikiyya’, doubtless reflecting the popular
nomenclature of his day.

41 This type of decoration composed of interlaced lobes around a circle was
relatively more common in the minor arts, notably metalwork, where the smaller
scale would allow the compass-drawn pattern to be drafted easily (e.g. the
celebrated mid-seventh/thirteenth-century brass wallet from Northern
Mesopotamia in the Courtauld Galleries: see B.W. Robinson ‘Oriental Metalwork
in the Gambier-Parry Collection’, The Burlington Magazine, March, 1967, 169-73,
pls. 81-83).

In an architectural context there are, apart from the two earlier Damascus
examples, analogous but later examples at the Mosque of Sultan Hasan
(757-64/1356-62) in Cairo and at the Ulu Cami (787/1385-86) in Manisa in
South-west Anatolia (M. Meinecke, Die mamlukische Architektur in Agypten und
Syrien (648/1250 bis 923/1517), p. 156 of typescript).

A similar motif was popular for decorating the haunches of arches,
especially in Syria and Anatolia. An incomplete series of examples is illustrated by
E. Herzfeld, CIA (Alep), pl. cix, and idem, ‘Damascus: Studies in Architecture — II’,
Al, x, 1943, fig. 83, to which should be added the unpublished early example
(carved, not inlaid) over the double window of the North Minaret (before 580/
1184: see EMA, i”, 177) of the Great Mosque in Damascus. In Palestine there are
several examples on mibrabs, most if not all of which were probably the work of
craftsmen from Damascus: in Jerusalem at the Qubbat al-Silsila (mibrab dated
659-71/1261-73) and the Tankiziyya Madrasa (729/1329); in Hebron at the Masjid
of Sanjar al-Jawili (720/1320) and the Haram (mibrab dated 732/1331-32); and in
Gaza at the Jami‘ of Ibn ‘Uthman (méhrab dated 834/1430-31). In Cairo there are
also several examples: e.g. at the so-called Mausoleum of Mustafa Pasha (¢.666-72/
1267-73: see MAE, ii, pl. 55a); the Aqbughawiyya Madrasa (740/1339: see The
Ministry of Waqfs, The Mosques of Egypt, Cairo, 1949, pl. 59); and an anonymous
tomb tentatively ascribed to the Amir Bashtak (c.740/1339-40: see M. Meinecke,
‘Zur mamlukischen Heraldik’, MDIK, xxviii, 247; 48, pl. lviii a).

","2. ee ate

Against the north face of the west abutment of the southern
colonnade stands a flat mibrab constructed of a pointed arch
supported on two re-used columns and decorated with marble
panelling (plate 27.1). Immediately to the west of this mibrab
is the Summer Pulpit.

The pulpit is a two-tiered structure composed of a little
hexagonal domed pavilion superimposed on a sculptured
quadrilateral base opening in round horseshoe arches on all
four sides. The arch in the south side of the base is blocked by
a later buttress wall. A staircase on the north side rises to the
pavilion.
 "
28,"Ill HISTORY
","Al-‘Umari, writing c.745/1345, describes the mibrab and the
 two-tiered dome beside it, which he says was called Qubbat al-
Mizan (the Dome of the Balance).! No mention is made of a
staircase, and there is no suggestion that the structure was used
as a pulpit at that time.

By Mujir al-Din’s day (901/1496) it was a pulpit, which he
was told had been restored by the Qadi Burhan al-Din b. Jama‘a
(born 725/1325, died 790/1388)? and which had formerly been
made of wood and borne on wheels? (see below). From it
prayers on the Muslim feasts were said and rogations made for
rain: a practice that continued at least unitl the end of the
seventeenth century, as attested by al-Nabulist.*

A further restoration, commemorated in an inscription on
a stela placed above the entrance to the staircase, was made in
1259/1843 during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan ‘Abd al-
Majid.
 "
28,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","The structural conjunctions between the colonnade and me
pulpit and between the pulpit and the miprab show that the
construction of the colonnade preceded that of the pulpit and
that both precede the mibrab. Since al-‘Umari accurately
describes both the mihrab and the two-tiered dome but not the
staircase, we can assume that the staircase was added some time
after 745/1345.

The two-tiered dome (plates 27.2 and 27.3) is composed
almost entirely of Crusader sculpture of the highest quality,
apparently taken from some Latin ciborium or baldacchino. It
has often been described,’ most recently and exhaustively by
Buschhausen.° The date of re-assembly of this Crusader
sculpture into its present form is not known except that it must
have been some time before 745/1345 when al-‘Umari
described it; most likely it was towards the end of the sixth/
twelfth century at the time of the Ayytbid purging and
reconsecration of the Haram (see above, p. 48).’ The only
obviously non-Crusader element is the marble ceiling of the
quadrilateral base, which is decorated with a low-relief
strapwork frieze in typical Ayyabid or Mamlak style.

It seems probable that the wooden structure on wheels
that Mujir al-Din was told of (see above) was actually a flight of
steps that could be wheeled up to the two-tiered dome when it
was to be used as a pulpit. The replacement of this ad hoc
contrivance by a stone staircase was presumably the object of
Burhan al-Din’s ‘restoration’ in the eighth/fourteenth century.
An early nineteenth-century engraving illustrates the pulpit as it
was before the restoration of 1259/1843. This engraving (fig.
27.2) shows that much of the present staircase, including the
marble balustrade carved in low-relief with panels of
strapwork, existed before the 1259/1843 restoration. What that
later restoration appears to have involved was the blocking of
a tall rectangular opening flanked by columns under both sides
of the upper part of the staircase and the fitting in their place of
vertical panels of marble decorated with Ottoman-style’
roundels including two with crescent-and-star motifs (see plate

original entrance to the staircase by the present entrance
surmounted by the inscription stela.

In short, then, little but the steps and balustrade of this
charming structure, now usually referred to as the Minbar of
Burhan al-Din, appears to belong to the restoration made by
that ga@di in the eighth/fourteenth century.
 7 The style of the Crusader sculpture in the pulpit is similar to that re-used on
the qibla wall of the Aqsa Mosque, redecorated in 583/1187-88 by Saladin. The
internal faces of the voussoirs of the horseshoe arches in the quadrilateral base of
the pulpit have curious annular grooves which closely resemble analogous
grooves in the voussoirs of the main mibrab of the Aqsa Mosque, also dated 583/
1187-88.

8 A wooden minbar on wheels is reported to have been used in the Great
Mosque of Cordova in the tenth century (F.H. Jiménez, ‘El almimbar movil del
siglo X de la mezquita de Cordoba’, Al-Andalus, xxiv, 1959, 381-99) and a similar
minbar was made by a craftsman from Ahlat in eastern Anatolia in 50/1155 for the
Great Mosque in Algiers (E. Kiihnel, Die islamische Kunst, Leipzig, 1929, 432).

","The site is bounded to the south by the street, Tariq Bab al-

various structures (not shown on the plan, fig. 28.2) including
some that form the north boundary.

The tomb consists of a domed chamber with wall arches
on three sides and a deeper recess on the fourth, north side. A
later opening in the rear wall of this recess leads to a small
cross-vaulted room, roughly built, that may predate the domed
chamber, which abuts against it. In the middle of that room
stands a stone cenotaph.

The masonry of the lower part of the east and west walls of
the domed chamber is different from the rest, which suggests
that it was built on the remains of an earlier construction of
which no other obvious traces survive.

The original entrance was from the west but it is now
blocked and one of two windows in the main street facade
serves as the present entrance.
 "
29,"1 HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION AND DATE

This building allows us to experience how lost we would be
generally without our trusty guide, Mujir al-Din. He somewhat
surprisingly fails to mention it at all, even though there is a brief
inscription,’ which gives us the following information:

In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate . . .
‘Every soul tastes death.” This tomb was built for the
deceased (lit. the martyr) Turkdn Khatin, daughter of the
Amir Tuqtay b. Saljutay al-Uzbaki, in the year seven
hundred and fifty-three [1352-3]

FOUNDER

The heading for this section is strictly inaccurate, because we
are clearly not faced with the case of a mausoleum built in
advance by its future and intended occupant. Even if death had
intervened before completion, one might have expected an
inscription something like that of the Amir Arghiin’s
foundation (see p. 356). The Lady Turkan was very likely from
the eastern parts of the Islamic world. The names of her father
and grandfather are those borne by members of the family of
the Khans of the Golden Horde, but it would be hazardous to
Suggest a positive identification. Van Berchem has created an
 elaborate hypothesis which portrays the lady coming to
Jerusalem on her pilgrimage to Mecca, dying during her stay
and being laid to rest in a tomb especially made for her, or,
more possibly, adapted from an existing structure by her
relatives or retinue.‘ As a story, all that one can say is that it is as
good as any other.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

As van Berchem has already argued, if Turkan Khatin was a
transient foreigner, coming from beyond the Mamlik frontiers,
that would explain why nothing was remembered of her and
perhaps why Mujir al-Din passed over the building in silence.
This silence is maintained by the Haram documents and by the
Ottoman sijills, as far as can be ascertained.

In van Berchem’s day (1914) it housed the stall of a
lemonade seller (CIA (Ville), 273). On 27 May 1926, L.A. Mayer
reported that the building was used as a dwelling house,
neglected and smoky inside (Palestine Archaeological
(Rockefeller) Museum, File Jerusalem’).
 "
29,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","STREET FACADE (fig. 28.3)
The street facade contains two windows set in shallow recesses,
0.12m deep, separated by a central stone pier bearing the
dedicatory inscription (translated above). The heads of the
recesses are spanned by cyma recta mouldings with downturns
at the outer ends.’

The whole facade is framed by a quirked ogee moulding
with a distinctive frieze® of fretted lobes protruding inwards
from it in such a way that the lobes carved in relief are matched
in mirror image by the excised lobes between them to form a
continuously repeating pattern (see plate 28.1). In the lateral,
vertical runs these lobes follow a ‘module’ provided by the
stone coursing, the larger (mostly lower) courses bearing three
lobes in relief and the smaller ones two. Since the lobes are
regular in size and the stones on which they are carved do not
consistently course through with the stonework of the rest of
the facade it would appear that these stones were carved off the
site in some mason’s yard. The same sort of ‘modular’ carving
occurs also at the top and bottom horizontal runs of the
moulding. Some coordination between the moulding carvers
and the builders must have existed, however, for the bottom
run is articulated around the bases of the window recesses.

The window jambs are of red and cream-coloured ablaq;
 elsewhere the construction is entirely of plain limestone.
Above each window lintel is a larger stone, slightly undercut
along the base as if to relieve the load on the lintel, and
elaborately carved with various star and palmette patterns.
Above each of these ornamental relieving lintels is a panel of
analogous carving, recessed about 0.03m from the surface of
the recess. On the pier between the two recesses are two more
panels of low-relief carving. The lower one is of strapwork
around a central rosette and the upper one is the dedicatory
inscription.

Asingle course of stones forms a later parapet on top of the
facade. This parapet obscures most of the dome from view
though the apex can still be seen from the street. The dome sits
on an octagonal drum, each side of which is pierced by a
pointed-arched slit housing a rectangular window (plate 28.2).
Alternate windows were blind, only four being open originally.
A later structure encroaches on the drum and dome from the
north (plate 28.3) and now only two windows remain open. A
cavetto moulding marks the exterior transition from the drum
to the dome. The dome is somewhat shallow in profile, built of
rubble masonry rendered with a sort of water-resistant plaster
of which traces survive. A carved stone finial completes the
design (plate 28.2).

INTERIOR (plan, fig. 28.2; sections, figs. 28.4—28.6)

The original entrance from the west is blocked and the left-
hand window in the facade has been converted to serve as a
doorway. It opens directly into the domed chamber. The floor
is paved with rough stone flags, presumably replacing an
earlier pavement.

From moulded imposts wall arches span the south, west
and east sides, and a deep recess opens in‘the north side (plate
28.4). That recess now has an opening in its rear wall into a
cross-vaulted room. The irregular masonry of the jambs and
segmental arch of this opening show it to be a later insertion.
The room to which it gives access appears to be an earlier
structure. It has a blocked opening, evidently the door that
originally gave access to it from the north. In the middle of the
floor is a stone cenotaph; there is none in the domed chamber.
It seems reasonable to surmise that this cenotaph (plate 28.5)
originally marked a grave in the usual place directly under the
dome, though no sign of sucha grave exists now, and that it was
removed to the adjoining room when the building was taken
over for domestic use.’ Perhaps it was at the same time that the
original entrance door in the west wall of that chamber was
blocked up (see plate 28.6).

Like the facade, the interior is decorated with panels of
low-relief carving, one in the tympanum of each wall arch and
one at the back of the north recess (figs. 28.4—28.6). On the
south side there is in addition an interesting mibrab (plate
28.7) on the internal face of the pier between the two windows.
It is badly eroded now but enough survives to establish its
original form: a flat recess 0.07m deep surmounted by a
pointed arch with gadrooning in the tympanum, pseudo-
voussoirs carved to represent a strange form of joggling, and
foliate scrollwork in the spandrels (plate 28.8).
 The eight-sided drum rests on  double-faceted
pendentives which taper down to bevelled points between
adjoining wall arches® (plate 28.9). Each side of the drum had
a shallow pointed-arched recess, alternate ones originally

 being pierced by unusually small slit windows (see sections,
figs. 28.4-28.6). Between the recesses little double-faceted
pendentives make the transition from the octagonal drum to
the circular base of the dome. Both drum and dome are coated
with plaster.

DATE OF CONSTRUCTION

Scrutiny of the structure tends to indicate that the tomb was
built on the remains of some earlier building. Van Berchem
(cited above, p. 321) speculated that the tomb itself was an
existing structure purchased after Turkaén Khatiin’s death to
serve as her funerary monument. There is, however, no real
evidence that this was the case. The building has the typical
domed cube form of a Mamluk tomb and it seems very unlikely
that there were builders in Jerusalem erecting tombs as
speculative ventures in the absence of a specific commission.
Nevertheless, the profusion and variety of carved ornamental
panels, together with the suggestive ‘modular’ treatment of the
fretted frame moulding, implies some sort of practical
commercial transaction, as if the designs had been chosen from
a monumental mason’s pattern book. It is not beyond the
bounds of possibility that following the death of Turkan Khatiin
the tomb was commissioned from a contract builder. At any
rate there is nothing in the architecture to suggest that it was not
built specifically as a funerary monument for Turkan Khatin, in
which case it should be dated shortly after her death in 753/
1352-53.

p. 378).

","The building, bounded by pre-existing structures on three
sides and the street on the fourth, comprises three main parts:
(1) a pair of domed tomb chambers beside the street, separated
from each other by an entrance portal and_ vestibule
surmounted by a third, higher domed chamber; the eastern
chamber houses a cenotaph marking a grave, presumably that
of Jamal al-Din; (2) a central open courtyard originally with a
tall arched recess in each of its east and west walls; (3) an earlier
barrel-vaulted hall in the north-west corner of the site and,
above that, a reception hall. Other structures on the north side
of the courtyard do not belong to the Kilaniyya and are not
accessible from it.

The building has been generally remodelled for domestic
use.
 "
30,"Il HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

The building is without a foundation inscription. It is located by
Mujir al-Din next to the Taziyya (see p. 399) on its west side. In
two Ottoman documents” of the middle of the sixteenth
century the kKilaniyya was given as the eastern boundary of a
first-floor house in the portion of David Street known as Siig al-
Qashshash? (Market of the Straw-worker). The south boundary
of the house is the street itself and the Tashtamuriyya arch over
the street.

FOUNDER AND DATE :
The information which Mujir al-Din gives’ is as follows:

The kilaniyya Mausoleum is situated next to the Taziyya on
the west side. It is named after the Hajj Jamal al-Din
Pahlavan, son of the Amir Shams al-Din Quradshah (sic) b.
Shams al-Din Muhammad al-Kilani al-Lahiji, known as the
son of the Lord of Kilan. In his will he instructed his son,
the Amir Nizam al-Din Kehshirwan to realise a hundred
thousand dirhams from the third of his property and to
hand that sum to his nephew, that is, the testator’s nephew,
the Amir ‘Ala’ al-Din ‘Ali b. Baha’ al-Din Salar b. Shir Malik
al-Kilani, to buy a plot and build a mausoleum in
Jerusalem, if it proved possible to transport his body and
bury it there. The date of the will was 10 Sha‘ban in the year
753 [21 September 1352]. This mausoleum was built,
which contains his grave. His body was brought there, as
he had willed.®
 One may assume that the actual construction took place
just a year or so after 753/1352.

To attempt to identify the founder, and following the clues
given by Mujir al-Din, one looks for a member of a princely
family ruling at the appropriate time in the district of Lahij, or
Lahijan,’ in the Caspian province of Gilan.* The historian Zahir
al-Din Mar‘ashi mentions two brothers, Sharaf al-Dawla and
Muhammad, who ruled Lahijan and Ranikith respectively and
both died in 766/1364-65.° Their father was called Pahlavan, and
may well be the Pahlavan whose corpse was buried in the
Kilaniyya. His grandfather — or father (the relationship is not
clear) — was called Nah Padshah, whom the Mongol Uljayta
confirmed in his rule of Lahijan in 706/1307, giving him also
wider authority throughout Gilan.'° According to the Mujir al-
Din printed text, the father of our Pahlavan was called
Quradshah. However, Sauvaire in his translation gave ‘Toubad-
Shah’, which is in fact the reading of one of the Bodleian
manuscripts.'' The other Oxford manuscript has the same
name, practically without diacritical points'? and the reading
Nu-Padshah is a very obvious one. Mar‘ashi uses the form Na-
Pasha, but Qashani has Na-Padshah. All in all, the identification
of the Pahlavan of the Kilaniyya with the member of the
fourteenth-century Nasirvand dynasty of Lahijan seems very
plausible. The founder of the Kilaniyya was described as al-
Haj (the pilgrim), and one of the sons mentioned above,
Sharaf al-Dawla, abdicated in favour of his son, Jahan, and set
out on the pilgrimage to Mecca but fell ill in Tabriz and died in
Lahijan, whither he had returned.

ENDOWMENT

The only information available is the brief note in the Defter no.
602."" That gives no date for the wagfiyya of the mausoleum
and mentions just three agricultural properties, all of which are
in the district of Ramla. Two are not fully legible in the register,
and only the third, which is called Ard al-‘Ajamiyya, has a figure
for revenue against it, namely 400 (aspers).

OTTOMAN PERIOD

Nota single reference to the Kilaniyya in the Haram documents
has been traced. Other Mamluk sources are equally silent.
Information is scanty in the Ottoman period too.

The two documents alluded to above” describe the
Kilaniyya as a ¢z¢rba in one case and a madrasa in the other. In
Muharram 985/April 1577 the overseer of the turba, ‘Abd al-
Raziq b. Shams al-Din b. Abi ‘l-Wafa’ al-Hanafi, reported to the
 qadi that through long neglect the building was in disrepair
and that the waqf possessed no ready capital and he sought and
gained permission to spend the income for 983/1575-76 on
necessary repairs.!°

Whether the Kilaniyya functioned as a madrasa or with a
madrasa extension is difficult to say. The case of the Taziyya
Mausoleum should be borne in mind (see p. 401). At all events
an appointment of a mudarris, Fadl Allah b. Ghadiya, was made
in 1129/1716. A series of appointments were made in 1156/
1743, none of which were specifically madrasa posts.
Moreover, they were concentrated in one family. Ibrahim al-
Daudi, deceased, had held a Koran ‘readership’ in the
‘madrasa’, the lamplighter and sweeper and rent-collector
positions in the turba, and various posts, shared half and half
with his brother, in the ‘madrasa’, i.e. deputy 7dzir, clerk, tomb
guardian (reading turbaddriyya ?) and another Koran
‘readership’. His sons took over these positions. The whole
situation suggests a family sinecure.'
 STREET FACADE (fig. 29.5)

The street frontage is bounded to the west by the first bay of a
vaulted Crusader building, possibly a market hall'® (see plan,
fig. 29.3). To the east the frontage abuts on the Taziyya which,
though erected after the Kilaniyya, may occupy the site of an
earlier building (see below, p. 399).

The facade (plate 29.1) is symmetrical about its central
axis. It is completely framed by a cavetto moulding that rises as
a rectangular pediment (pish-taq) over the entrance portal. On
either side of the entrance, each tomb chamber has two grilled
windows set back slightly within a quirked ogee frame
moulding (plate 29.2). (The eastern windows are now
blocked.) The stone course above the lintel of each window is
decoratively undercut with a pattern of curves and darts (plate
29.3) as if to relieve the load on the lintels. The next course
above is recessed 1.5cm to form a sunken panel with decorated
 ends that may have been intended for an inscription though
none was ever applied. Above the mouldings framing the main
windows each tomb chamber has an upper window (plate
29.4) placed directly over the central mullion of the lower
windows. These upper windows are set in identical recesses
with sloping sills and muzgarnas heads (plate 29.5).

The centrally-placed recess for the entrance portal is
130m deep, crowned by a fluted semidome supported on
three tiers of muqarnas corbelling. Remains of stone benches
flanking the door are barely discernible in Creswell’s 1920
photograph (plate 29.6).'? The masonry course above the
monolithic door lintel is undercut to form a thin rectangular
groove, apparently intended to suggest visually some reduction
of direct load on the lintel. The third course above the lintel is
sunk 0.015m around the recess and onto the facade where it
ends with decorative terminals. Above that course two little
pendentive-like mgarnas elements mark the springing of the
robust muqarnas corbelling under the semidome (plate 29.7).
The apex of the semidome was repaired with concrete some
time after 1920 (see plate 29.8).

Above the entrance portal three windows open into the
central domed chamber. The middle window, larger than the
ones on either side of it, is set in a meqarnas-headed recess.
The masonry course above the lintels of the flanking windows
is undercut in the same way as the lower windows of the
eastern and western tomb chambers.

The three domes rise above the facade, the central one
about 1.20m higher than those of the tomb chambers (which
are partly obscured by modern parapet walls). The central and
eastern domes rest on octagonal drums pierced by eight
windows; those in the central drum are rectangular and those
in the eastern drum round-headed. The western drum is
sixteen sided and has eight round-headed windows. All the
drums have simple splay-faced cornices.

VESTIBULE (fig. 29.3; sections, figs. 29.6 and 29.7)

The original iron-plated doors (plate 29.9) survive, though
only the left-hand one now opens.” It leads down one step into
a vestibule roofed by a folded cross vault with a small cupola at
the crown. This vault is no longer visible from the vestibule
since a later vault has been inserted to provide an extra floor
(see section, fig. 29.7). In the east and west walls of the vestibule
are doors into the tomb chambers. The eastern one is now
blocked but the western one retains its original timber double
leafed doors which are bound by four brass straps. The floors
of the tomb chambers are about 0.90m higher than the floor of
the vestibule and the thresholds of the doors into these
chambers are a similar height above the vestibule floor. There
must originally have been steps up to the doors but nothing
survives now apart from piles of rubble against the walls.

west wall. Originally it rose the full height to the apex of the
dome (11.15m) but was subsequently divided by two later
vaults to provide extra accommodation. Evidently it was
intended for a tomb since there is a barrel-vaulted crypt under
the floor, which can be seen through a recent breach in the
lower wall of the vestibule (section, fig. 29.7). Whether or not
any burial was ever made there is not known, but it seems
unlikely: there is no mention of one in the texts and no trace of
one is visible.”!

The chamber was lit by windows on three levels. At the
lowest level are two pairs of originally grilled windows, one
pair in the south wall opening in the street facade (described
above) and the other pair (now much altered) in the north wall
opening on the courtyard. The southern pair of windows retain
their double leaf timber shutters bound like the door leaves
with four bands of brass. A middle-level window opens in the
south wall and, at the top of the chamber, are eight windows in
the drum. The interior of the drum is eight sided though the
exterior is sixteen sided.

EASTERN TOMB CHAMBER

This chamber is similar in size and shape to the western one
apart from a tall pointed-arched recess in its east wall, at the
rear of which there is a small cupboard. The arch of the recess
springs from two re-used columns with ‘thick leaf Crusader
capitals and ‘water-holding’ bases (fig. 29.7).

The chamber was damaged by fire in 1938 but traces of an
interlaced triple bead moulding (ig. 29.7, plate 29.10) planted
in the plaster around the arch, door and window openings still
exist in places. Like the western chamber this one has been
divided by two later floors.

It is lit by an arrangement of windows identical to that of
the western chamber except for an extra north-facing window
at the middle level. At the same level smooth pendentives
(plate 29.11) rise to support the eight-sided drum.

In the middle of the floor a stone cenotaph with plastered
sides and curious triple humps running lengthwise from east to
west (figs. 29.3 and 29.7) marks a grave, presumably that of
Jamal al-Din, who commissioned the building and is buried in
it, according to Mujir al-Din. The area under the floor is
inaccessible but it may reasonably be assumed that there is a
crypt here like the one under the western chamber.

COURTYARD
A door at the north end of the vestibule opens directly into the
courtyard. It retains much of its original paving at a level 0.85m
below that of the street and this difference in levels is
accommodated by two steps within the vestibule and another
two in the courtyard itself. The latter two steps are modern but
must replace earlier steps (as shown in the axonometric
reconstruction, fig. 29.9).

At the north side of the courtyard two barrel-vaulted halls
appear to have existed before the construction of the Kilaniyya;
 these defined the northern boundary of the site. The Crusader
halls (above, p. 327) defined the western boundary, and the
eastern boundary may have been defined by some pre-existing
structure which was later incorporated into the Taziyya. The
tomb chambers and vestibule next to the street form the
southern boundary.

Within these limits the builders of the Kildniyya clearly
endeavoured to provide as large a courtyard as possible. But its
original arrangement is no longer obvious. On the north side
the pre-existing wall seems merely to have been heightened
and re-faced. But the west and east walls have been largely
rebuilt and are obscured by modern outbuildings in the
courtyard. Both are discernible, however, in the plan (fig.
29.3).

At the centre of each wall is a broad recess originally
spanned by a tall pointed arch, as shown in the east wall by
voussoirs remaining in situ on the right-hand side. These show
the initial arrangement, for the ashlar masonry coursing next to
the voussoirs matches that of the south wall which is
undoubtedly original. The upper structure of the west wall has
disappeared but its plan is still visible.

The recesses in the two walls were designed to mirror
each other, but they differ in depth. That in the west wall is
1.80m deep from front to back, and that in the east only 1.03m.
The difference is explained by the differing uses made of the
spaces behind the walls on either side. Giving access to these,
there is in each wall a pair of rectangular doors placed
symmetrically at the north and south ends. On the east side the
two doors lead only into tiny chambers measuring 1.30 x 2.04m
and 0.58 x 1.15m respectively. On the west side the door at the
south end gives access to a narrow passage running south to a
well-head (now blocked).” The similar door at the north end
of the wall opens into a staircase (see below). These four
doorways survive intact.

The south wall of the courtyard (fig. 29.8) is also built
mostly of fine ashlar masonry. Above the door from the
vestibule, the masonry rises in a tall pish-taq framed by a cavetto
moulding (plate 29.12). This moulding extends at slightly
different levels on either side of the pish-taq across the walls of
the tomb chambers. At the south-west corner of the courtyard
it turns and continues for a short distance along the west wall.
Originally it must have extended around the four sides of the
courtyard; a short length of it survives i sitz at the same level
at the west end of the north wall (see below). Above the
moulding on either side of the pish-taq, the upper walls of the
 tomb chambers are built of coursed, snecked rubble rendered
with a plaster facing of which substantial traces survive. The
middle-level window of the eastern tomb chamber opens in
the lowest courses of that rubble masonry and, in the
corresponding position on the west side of the pish-tdq, a
somewhat smaller window lights a staircase leading to the
central domed chamber (see below). Directly above the
vestibule door there is a window intended to light the vestibule
and, above that, three windows in the ashlar masonry of the
pish-taq light the central domed chamber.

Plastered rubble masonry appears to have been used also
for the upper walls on the other three sides of the courtyard,
though it survives now only at the south end of the west wall
and at the west end of the north wall. The original height of
these walls was 9.28m; at that height the remains of stepped
undercut crenellations survive i situ on either side of the pish-
taq at the south wall and at the west end of the north wall. These
crenellations, unique in Jerusalem, must have crowned all four
walls of the courtyard (but not the pish-iaq), as suggested in fig.
29:9:

NORTHERN HALLS

At the north side of the courtyard are two barrel-vaulted halls.
They share roughly the same alignment, about 6° askew on a
line drawn perpendicular to the west wall of the courtyard. This
different orientation seems to indicate that these halls predate
the construction of the Kilaniyya. The eastern hall incorporates
stones bearing Crusader masons’ marks, indicating that it
cannot be earlier than the sixth/twelfth century. The north walls
of the halls appear to coincide more or less with the northern
boundary line, if produced westward, of an underlying bridge”
which spans eastwards across the town’s central (‘Tyropoeon’)
valley, al-Wad, towards the Haram.

The eastern hall is not accessible from the Kilaniyya and, to
judge from the complete absence of openings in its south wall,
it never was. The western hall appears, however, to have been
incorporated into the Mamlik foundation, though the present
door and windows under a half-arch (plate 29.13) in its south
wall are obviously of relatively recent construction. The rest of
the north wall of the courtyard appears also to be modern,
though perhaps only a re-facing of the earlier wall since the
vault beyond it is intact. Two blind arches in the masonry of this
wall seem to have been intended to improve its stability; they
do not correspond to either of the recesses in the south wall of
the eastern hall (see plan, fig. 29.3).
 UPPER FLOORS (plans, figs. 29.3 and 29.4)

On the upper level there appear to have been only two rooms,
one over the entrance vestibule (described below) and one
over the western hall at the north-west corner of the courtyard.
The latter is reached now by a modern stairway, the original
staircase having disappeared. It is possible to reconstruct that
original staircase in the very limited space available as shown in
fig. 29.9. The unusually narrow stairs (0.68m wide) can be
explained by the builders’ desire to keep the courtyard as wide
as possible (see above). Within the door at the north end of the
west wall the stairs rose immediately to the left, wound through
360°, and continued up to a small landing. From the landing the
upper floor room is reached up three steps through a narrow
pointed-arched doorway (0.79m wide) into a tunnel-vaulted
passageway leading up one more step to a cross-vaulted
antechamber. From there a pointed arch opens into a large hall
to the east.

The tripartite vaulting of this hall is distinctive: a central
folded cross vault with a fluted cupola at the crown and flanked
by cross vaults at its north and south ends. This system of
vaulting, similar to that of the gd as in the Palace of Sitt Tunshuq
(no. 48) and the Tashtamuriyya (no. 45), suggests that the room
was intended to serve as a reception hall. It is the only large
room in the complex. (The adjoining elaborately decorated
domed room to the east is a later, Ottoman addition entered
from the Taziyya.) Paired rectangular windows surmounted by
a circular oculus and a smaller rectangular window open in the
reception hall’s south wall (plate 29.13), which is the only part
of the north wall of the courtyard to retain its original form.
The segmental-arched window in the north wall of the hall is a
later insertion.

The staircase serving the reception hall described above
continued from the landing beside the entrance to the hall up
to a covered gallery running behind the upper part of the west
wall of the courtyard (see fig. 29.9). Further flights of steps at
either end of that gallery led up to the roofs of the western tomb
chamber and of the reception hall at its south and north end
respectively. Only the uppermost steps of these stairs survive.
The shaving of the drum of the western tomb chamber, giving
 it sixteen sides instead of eight, was presumably to permit
easier passage to the windows of the central domed chamber
where Koran readings might have been held (see below).

The central domed chamber was reached by a separate
staircase built mainly within the thickness of the north wall of
the western tomb chamber (plate 29.14). The lower part of the
staircase has disappeared and has been replaced in recent
times by a flight of steps against the north wall of the western
tomb chamber. So far as we can tell, the original staircase was
entered from a door in the south side of the arched recess in
the middle of the west wall of the courtyard (see fig. 29.9). From
there it rose south to a small landing where it turned eastwards
in the thickness of the tomb chamber wall. At the top the stairs
skew southwards to open into the central domed chamber. A
similar opening (now blocked) in the north-east corner of the
chamber led out to the roof of the eastern tomb chamber, from
which it may once have led down to a gallery along the east side
of the courtyard.

The central domed chamber over the vestibule has three
windows in the south wall overlooking the street, three in its
north wall overlooking the courtyard, two in its west wall (one
now blocked) into the western tomb chamber, two in its east
wall (one now blocked) into the eastern tomb chamber, and
eight (all blocked) in the drum, which supports an internally
fluted dome (fig. 29.7). Obviously eighteen windows are more
than were required for light and ventilation; indeed, the room
must have been exceedingly uncomfortable in winter. Since
the foundation included at least one Koran reader, the most
likely reason for this profusion of openings was to enable
readings in this room to be heard in the street, in the courtyard
and (since there were windows in both tomb chambers)
‘within the hearing of the dead’, as one writer puts it.”

INSCRIPTION (plate 29.15)

An inscribed stone plaque was recovered in 1969 from debris
on the floor of the eastern tomb chamber. It is now housed in
the Haram Museum. The inscribed surface is very badly
damaged, apparently by being recut for use as a paving slab,
and the six lines of text are generally indecipherable. Lines 2-3
appear, however, to read

... the High Amir [Sharaf] al-Din ‘Isa b. [Badr al-Din?]. . .
If this reading is correct, the inscription may come from a Dar
al-Hadith (Tradition School), said by Mujir al-Din” to be near

and to the west of the Jaliqiyya (no. 11), about 30m to the east
of the Kilaniyya, which was founded in 666/1268 by the Amir
 Sharaf al-Din ‘Isa b. Badr al-Din b. Abi'l-Qasim al-Hakkari, son
of the founder of the Ayyubid Badriyya Madrasa (610/1213-

thought it was part of the Church of St. Giles (‘The Churches of St. Martin and St.
 John the Evangelist’, PEFQS, 1893, 303-4). The form of the building, difficult to
determine nowadays, is not that of a church but rather that of some commercial
structure. The cross-vaulted bays, divided by transverse arches, spring from
limestone columns with simple capitals (fig. 29.11). The upper storey appears to
be of Ottoman construction. The masonry is pierced by a window with an arch of
gadroon voussoirs (now hidden behind a timber oriel window and part of the
qa@a of the Tashtamuriyya, no. 45). The remains of a corbel, apparently of
Crusader workmanship, survive alongside that window.

23 A passage has recently been cleared under one arch of this bridge. A definite
boundary line can be detected to the north of Tariq Bab al-Silsila in the composite
structure of the bridge. The northern walls of the halls attached to the Kilaniyya
are approximately parallel to that boundary line. Part of this area under the bridge
was examined archaeologically in 1931, the evidence suggesting that the central
arch of the bridge was early Islamic with later extensions, including stones with
characteristic Crusader dressing, added to north and south (R.W. Hamilton, ‘Street

","Very little of the original construction survives and so it is

The original building was bounded to the north by the upper
part of the Haram wall, and on the east and west respectively by
the adjoining madrasas, the Aminiyya and the Almalikiyya. In
this way the development was initially confined to the roof of
the Haram portico.
 "
31,"Ill HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

There is no extant inscription and the foundation was several
years too late to be mentioned by al-‘Umari in his account of the
Haram.' Mujir al-Din sites the Farisiyya on the north side of the
Haram and in his methodical progress from west to east he
places the Farisiyya between the Almalikiyya and the Aminiyya.”
It is in this position that al-Umari mentioned a door giving
access via stairs to a Zawiyat al-Lawi, which is otherwise
unknown.>

DATE

Mujir al-Din claims to have seen the waqf document in which
a portion of the village of Tulkarm was given in endowment to
the Farisiyya. The date of the document was 3 Sha‘ban 755/23
August 1354.4 However, the earlier date of 753/1352-53 is that
given by the Tahrir Register no. 602° for the wagfiyya in which
half the village of Shuwayka was made wagf for the institution,
called in the register a khanqah. There is no reason why there
should not have been at least two separate endowment deeds.
We may assume that the Farisiyya was founded soon after 750/
1349-50.

FOUNDER

Faris al-Din Ilbaki b. Qutlamalik® was the nephew of the Amir
al-Hajj Almalik (see p. 308). In 745/1344-45 he was assigned the
amirate of the deceased son-in-law of his uncle. Before then
Ilbaki had been an officer ( mugqaddam) in the Halga, which
Post now went to his brother, Darit. He had been serving as the
Major-Domo of his uncle, the viceroy.’ He apparently escaped
lasting misfortune as a result of his uncle’s fall, and in the
following year he was made a Tablkhana amir. In 749-50/1348-
49 he went to the Hijaz as Amir of the Hajj and carried out some
 restoration work on the aqueduct from Arafat to Mecca, which
the IIkhanid amir, Chaban, had earlier restored in 726/1326.28

He took on the post of governor of Gaza in Jumada I 751/
July-August 1350. After a bare year he was replaced and
returned to Cairo.’ Late in 752/spring 1351, now holding an
amirate of 100, he was engaged in operations against the
Bedouin of Upper Egypt. The next year he took part in a
campaign against Baybugha Ris in Syria under the command of
the Amir Taz.'° Safadi’s brief notice given over to Ilbaki was
written while the latter was still alive. Ibn Hajar gives his date of
death as late Shawwal 756/early November 1355.""!

That same year in Cairo Ilbaki had demolished a church,
which had been damaged in anti-Christian disturbances, and
rebuilt it as a madrasa, which was also known as the Farisiyya.'
His period as governor of Gaza left its mark in Jerusalem in the
form of an inscription, dated 751/1350-51, recording some
restoration work on the Aqsa portico, carried out ‘on the
initiative of his Honour Faris al-Din, his Majesty the Sultan’s
governor in the Coastal and Hill Districts’.!° Although the close
control of the work was in the hands of the Superintendent of
the Two Harams, ‘Izz al-Din Aybak al-Misri,'* one may speculate
that Mhaki visited Jerusalem during the second half of 751/1350
in connection with the work on the Aqsa and to give
instructions for his own madrasa. This would fit well with the
dates discussed above. As with the foundation in Cairo, it may
have been a case of adapting a previously existing building, the
Zawiyat al-Lawi referred to above. Another part of IIbaki’s
foundation was some sort of zawiya (also called a madrasa)
within the Aqsa near the Well of the Leaf.'>

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

There is no mention of the Farisiyya in the Haram documents
and only one shaykh of the madrasa is known by name for the
Mamluk period, Zayn al-Din ‘Abd al-Rahman b. ‘Umar, a local
Hanbali scholar of Tradition (749-838/1348-1434).'° On the
other hand, the Farisiyya makes frequent appearances in the
Ottoman court registers, where the reference is often to the
‘two Farisiyya Madrasas’ (see above). It seems quite clear that in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and beyond the main
Farisiyya on the north portico of the Haram was a sinecure for
members of the al-Dayri family. The posts of inspector and
shaykh were divided into fractions, even into sixths,!” which
were passed on by inheritance. In 1008/1599 three of the
family, joint inspectors of the two Farisiyyas, farmed the
revenue of half the olives of Shuwayka to four local headmen
for 95 gold pieces.'* The sum contracted for in 1092/1681 was
 150 piastres along with the appointment to act as mudbtasib and
to collect the customary dues.'? An entry for 1080/1669
confirmed Fath al-Din b. Taha al-Dayri as successor to his
deceased father in the post of shaykh and in his residential
occupation of the madrasa.” To all intents and purposes the
madrasa and its endowments had become the private property
of the family.
 "
31,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","The founder obviously had an eye for economy: having
appropriated with few if any modifications the Crusader annex
to the Aqsa Mosque (the second of the ‘two Farisiyya Madrasas’)
he then proceeded to insert his madrasa into a site where three
of the four exterior walls were already standing.

The madrasa and possibly also the portico supporting it
must have collapsed at some later date, presumably during an
earthquake. The Ottoman rebuilding on the site of the madrasa
is arranged to provide comfortable domestic accommodation.

HARAM FRONTAGE (fig. 30.5, plate 30.1)
Mujir al-Din states that the ancient portico under the Aminiyya
was reconstructed in 610/1213-14. The piers of that Ayyabid
reconstruction survive, but apart from a fragmentary cornice
moulding and the springers of the left-hand (western) arch the
remainder of the frontage appears to have been rebuilt. Certain
details of the structure and its scanty decoration — notably the
double row of voussoirs over each of the three arches of the
portico and the ‘fretwork’ ornament over the right-hand
window lintel at the upper floor level (visible in plate 30.1) -—
are manifestly Ottoman, and the uniformity of the masonry
above the arches of the portico implies a unity of construction.
The sloping-topped central piers have short vertical
extensions, also with sloping tops, added to buttress the wall.
The rebuilt portico was blocked up some time before
19147! save for rectangular windows in the two left-hand arches
and the open tympanum of the right-hand arch. Under the
portico the rear (north) wall is plastered and devoid of
architectural features; the Antonia rock scarp begins
hereabouts to rise above the level of the ground.
 PIAS OV.T Malalll POMlLAYGeS OF AITTIGUALY Ya

ENTRANCE COMPLEX

The entrance to the Farisiyya is situated under the portico
which sustains the Almalikiyya. There, a simple doorway opens
in the north wall of the Haram built on the Antonia rock scarp,
which at this point stands about 2.50m above the level of the
Haram esplanade. A stairway of three flights, sheltered by the
portico, rises to a landing in front of this elevated doorway (fig.
30.6). The space under the landing was formerly utilized for a
small closet, but it is blocked now.”

Beyond the entrance doorway a narrow passage (plate
30.2) leads up to a low, dark chamber apparently partly cut into
the rock (fig. 30.4). This must be the Zawiyat al-Lawi which al-
‘Umari located thus“. . . after (the two windows of the Aminiyya)
 comes a door through which one goes up to the Zawiyat al-
Lawi.”? Mujir al-Din makes no mention of the zawiya, which
may by then have been incorporated into the Farisiyya.
Therefore the stairway under the portico and the passage must
have belonged initially to the zawiya before Faris al-Din made
use of them for access to his madrasa. The staircase rising
towards the east past the zawiya may also have existed prior to
the construction of the madrasa. It leads directly up to a
forecourt by the madrasa’s original entrance, now enclosed
within a later room (A). The southern extension of the staircase
(plate 30.3) appears to be a later addition; it connects with a
passage cut through the Haram wall to replace the original
entrance to the madrasa, which is blocked.
 That original entrance doorway is hewn out of the Haram
wall and, though blocked, retains its simple pointed-arched
profile. It seems to be the only structural feature of the Mamlak
development to have survived at this level. All the other
construction appears to be Ottoman with the exception of the
Haram wall itself (which actually projects here above the roof,
as shown in plate 30.4) and the possible exception of the
 impenetrable offset structure which may mark the site of some
fortificiation connected with the ancient Tower Antonia (see
above, p. 315).

INTERIOR DECORATION

A quantity of marble, presumably the remains of wall panelling
used to decorate the original madrasa, is incorporated in the
Ottoman assemblage paving the floor (plate 30.5). This
includes two pieces of a rectangular plaque (plates 30.6 and
30.7) carved with an exquisite foliate decoration in the shape of
a pointed ovoid, each of the points having a trefoil finial, linked
to a rectangular border whose corners are similarly decorated.
This type of ornament occurs fairly frequently in Bahri Mamltk
marble wall panelling and in Jerusalem there are other
examples, all attributable to the Amir Tankiz, surviving in two
monuments: the Tankiziyya Madrasa (no. 18) and the Aqsa
Mosque (730/1330-31).* The carved design on the fragments in
the Farisiyya, similar to those in the Aqsa Mosque, is identical to
those in the Tankiziyya (plate 18.16), which both appear to be
 the work of the same craftsman. Faris al-Din may well have
retrieved one or more panels from the east wall of the Aqsa
Mosque during the works he supervised there in 751/1350-51
(above, p. 337). In that case Tankiz’s marble panelling in the
Aqsa Mosque would be more extensive than was previously

thought.

Entrance is by way of a long passageway from the street,
Tariq Bab al-Hadid. This passageway was built as part of the
Arghiiniyya, presumably replacing some earlier access blocked
by the Arghtiniyya (see below, p. 359). It leads through a barrel-
vaulted cell to an open courtyard enclosed by cells on the
south, west and north sides. Two iwédns confront each other
across the east end of the courtyard. The most important units
of the complex are situated at this end of the courtyard beside
the Haram wall. These are: an assembly hall with a mibrab, and
a domed tomb chamber with an adjoining anteroom.

The building has undergone various alterations and some
later structures occupy the courtyard and the roofs of cells
around the courtyard:
 "
32,"Iii HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

In the absense of any inscription, one simply takes note of Mujir
al-Din’s locating the Khatiniyya in the area of the Bab al-Hadid
and makes the identifcation by a process of elimination. Al-
‘Umari is silent on the Khatiniyya. For that stretch of the Haram
wall he mentioned only a door leading into a Safi’s cell, which
means that the Khatiniyya did not exist in about 745/1345.'

DATE

Two separate endowments are mentioned by Mujir al-Din.”
The first is dated 5 Rabi‘ II 755/29 April 1354, so that we may
assume that the building was begun soon after 750/1349-50.
However, it was not completed until about twenty-five years
later, when the second endowment was effected, the date of
which is given as late Jumada II 782/late September 1380.

FOUNDER

The initial builder was a certain Oghul Khatiin, daughter of
Shams al-Din Muhammad b. Sayf al-Din, known as_al-
Qazaniyya, from Baghdad. The lady who completed the
construction was named Isfahan Shah, daughter of the Amir
Qazan Shah. No sure identification has proved possible. Van
 Berchem remarked’ that they were possibly pilgrims who
belonged to a great Turkish or Mongol family under the
Jalairids. The mention of Baghdad in the mid-fourteenth
century, of course, points in this direction. Oghul Khatin,
however, was possibly a resident of Jerusalem for a number of
years since there exists in the Islamic Museum in the Haram a
Koran ‘part’ donated by her in the year 760/1359 to be used ‘in
the Khattiniyya Zawiya which she had built in Jerusalem’. The
manuscript is the twelfth ‘part’ of a set (rab a) consisting of
thirty altogether. The waqf note describes the donor as ‘the
builder of charitable and pious [institutions], the special
nurturer (murabbiya) of princes and sultans, the Hdajja
(pilgrim) Oghul Khatiin, daughter of the Amir Muhammad, son
of the Amir Thawr’. This is suggestive of high-rank but
completely unspecific.*

Does the epithet ‘al-Qazaniyya’ mean that Oghul Khatin
was the wife of Qazan Shah? Since her father and grandfather
are named, she could hardly have been a slave. It would be
entirely credible if her foundation was completed by a
daughter, Isfahan Shah.

ENDOWMENT
The text of Mujir al-Din specifies that the initial endowment of
Oghul Khatin consisted of agricultural land (mazra‘a) known
as ‘the Camel’s Back’, which before the chronicler’s time had
somewhat mysteriously changed its name to ‘the Camel’s Belly’.
What Isfahan Shah added to the endowment is not mentioned
by Mujir al-Din, but details are given by Defter no. 602 for ‘The
wadf of Isfahan Shah, daughter of Qazan Shah, the date of the
endowment instrument being the year 914 [1508-91]> This
date must be that of a later confirmation or copy of the waqf.
The five items, not all clearly legible, are as follows:
(i) 5 parcels of land in Qasr al-Bakjiri (?) in Damascus (al-
Sham) known .. . as al-Mari (?) etc.: yield 160 (aspers)
(ii) House to the right of the Bab al-Hadid near the Ribat of the
Sultan:® annually . . . [left blank]
(iii) House in the Zion Quarter: annually 80 (aspers)
(iv) Shop near the mill : annually 10 (aspers)
(v) Apartment (tabaqa) ... known as Hawsh al-Futaih
(vi) Shop in the Cotton-Merchants’ Market.

The nature of the earlier waqf is confirmed by Defter no.

pas SERN P
 the waqfiyya in the Court record (siill) is dated the year
897/1491-92.

The mazra a known as ‘the Camel’s Back’, now known
as ‘the Camel’s Belly’, belonging to (the district of)
Jerusalem, near Dar Jarir:* (annual) yield 3,800 (aspers).

MAMLUK PERIOD

To judge from four references in Mujir al-Din’s work the
Khattiniyya came to be used, at least in part, as a residence for
amirs of some distinction sent to Jerusalem under a cloud. For
instance, the Amir Kha’irbak al-Zahiri Khushqadam, who was
known as the ‘Sultan for a Night’, having moved from his more
extreme exile in Mecca, died a year later, 879/1474, in the
Khatiniyya.” Another amir, Jani Beg, arrested at ‘Aqaba in
Muharram 883/April 1478 and sent to Jerusalem, died in the
Khatiiniyya in Rajab/October of the same year.!° The governor
of Damascus, Qansth al-Yahyawi, blamed for a defeat before
 Edessa at the hands of the Karakoyunlu, was despatched to
Jerusalem in 886/1481 and took up residence in the Khatuniyya
Madrasa."" Finally, the Amir Yashbak al-Jamali died there in 901/
1496.""

OTTOMAN PERIOD
The administration of the Khatiiniyya and its endowments was
in the hands of the Ibn Jama‘a family. Such is the inference to be
drawn from various entries in the Court Records. Hafiz al-Din
‘Abd al-Nabi b. Jama‘a, mufti in Jerusalem, became shaykh with
a daily salary of two aspers in 964/1557,""° and the post of
bawwab was divided by 982/1575 in a way that seems typical of
institutions which have lost their active role and become family
sinecures, one half of the post passing to a brother (Taha), and
a quarter to a son (Ahmad), of the deceased previous holder,
Muhyi al-Din b. Jama‘a.'4

The same Taha b. Jama‘a, now appearing as administrator
 of the waqf, presented an account of the 982/1574-75 income
from the ‘Camel’s Belly’ and rent of a house and mill in
Jerusalem:”°
 The same wadf property in 986/1578 was contracted by the
administrator, Taha b. Jama‘a to the imam of the Dome of the
Rock, Sharaf al-Din Misa b. Fityan al-Hanafi, for 220 mudds of
wheat and 110 of barley, from which amounts deductions were
to be made for expenses. They were in mudds, 20 wheat and 10
barley for ‘tithe (shr) of the imams’, 15 of wheat for transport,
and 49 of barley for half the transport and other administration
expenses, leaving 185 of wheat and 51 of barley clear for the
waqf. The combined value works out at 1,078 paras.’ Later in
the same month an arrangement marginally more profitable
for the waqf was arrived at with other persons!” in which the
amount fixed was 300 mudds of wheat, with administrative
costs to be deducted: it was further stipulated that if a yet higher
offer were to be made and accepted before the crops were
assessed, a compensation of 15 paras a day would be paid for
labour and care of crops.'®

Over a hundred years later the administrator of both the
Zamaniyya and the Khatiiniyya Madrasas presented a report’?
on the state of the two buildings together with an assessment of
the repair costs, which amounted in the case of the Khatiniyya
to 300 piastres. The features of the Khatiiniyya mentioned in the
report were the western room (oda), the second room within
it, the facilities (murtafiq) reached via a new door, the
madrasa’s kitchen, the passage-way (dibliz),° the western
screening wall (sitdra), situated on the wall of the madrasa’s
mosque (jami'), the mosque itself and the tomb chamber
(madfan) in it.
 "
32,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","HARAM FRONTAGE (fig. 31.4)
The west wall of the Haram has been refaced, disguising the
original disposition of openings under the portico shown in
van Berchem’s 1914 photograph” and Creswell’s 1920 one
(plate 31.1). These were a plain door into the assembly hall and
a grilled window to the tomb chamber. The door has been
converted into a window and a new door has been opened into
the assembly hall, while the tomb chamber window has been
made into a door. The new door and windows of the assembly
hall bear elaborate funerary inscriptions commemorating
some of the dignitaries buried in that hall, including
Muhammad ‘Ali al-Hindi, who was the first to be buried there,
in 1930.

Other structures — with an elaborate facade on the Haram
— stood on the roof of the portico until 1925 when they were
demolished.” It is not known exactly when these structures
were erected (see below).

INTERIOR (plan, fig. 31.3)
The present entrance passageway from Tariq Bab al-Hadid was
built as part of the Arghtiniyya, which was completed in 759/
 1358 (see below, p. 356). Nothing is known of an earlier
entrance. The passageway, 14.45m long, leads south to a plain
doorway into a barrel-vaulted cell (marked ‘A’ on the plan),
which serves as a sort of entrance vestibule. This cell originally
opened south to the courtyard through a door in the middle of
its south wall but this door has been blocked by the
construction of a later, Ottoman staircase and replaced by a
high-level window. Instead, two new doors give access to the
courtyard, one in the east wall, which is reached bya flight of six
steps up to the north zwdn, and one in the west wall, which
leads through an adjoining cell (B) and from there under the
later staircase to the courtyard.

The courtyard is split from north to south on two levels,
the west end being lower than the east end. Much of this
difference in level is accounted for by an accumulation of
debris at the east end, where it covers the lower part of a
decorated ablaq facade. How far this facade continues below
the present surface level will be revealed only by excavation.
Nevertheless, the original threshold of a door in that facade is
calculated to be about 1.45m above the original lower
courtyard level (see below) and so to reach it a total of at least
five steps would have been needed. The reconstruction
suggested in fig. 31.9 shows three steps up to the door in
addition to two steps dividing the courtyard.

In the middle of the courtyard there is a well-head made
froma hollowed column base giving access to a cistern below.

The layout of cells (A-K) around the courtyard is shown on
the plan, fig. 31.3. The doors and windows of most of these cells
have been rebuilt in recent years. (Two of the original pointed-
 arched doors, at the south-west corner of the courtyard, are
visible in Creswell’s 1920 photograph, plate 31.2.) The interiors
of several cells have also been altered by the breaching or
removal of partition walls, and two cells (E and H) in the north-
west and south-west corners are no longer accessible. The door
at the south end of the west wall leads to a small landing with a
blocked door to the west and a stair rising south to the roof. A
quirked ogee moulding forms a cornice above the cells around
the courtyard. The structures above this cornice are later,
almost certainly Ottoman, additions.

At the east end of the north and south walls the same
moulding forms a sort of impost supported by coupled elbow
brackets from which spring the arches of the two Zwans that
confront each other across this end of the courtyard. These
elbow brackets (fig. 31.11) are most unusual features, though
not unique.” At the east end of the porch at the Aqsa Mosque a
virtually identical bracket is to be found, which is described by
Hamilton as a passable copy of the original (Crusader) brackets
in the central bays of that porch.”* That copy is part of the
rebuilding of the east end of the porch in 751/1350 under the
supervision of an Egyptian amir, ‘Izz al-Din Aybak al-Misri.”
Indeed, the brackets at the Khatiniyya are so similar to the one
at the Aqsa Mosque that we may infer with some confidence that
they were carved by the same mason, possibly shortly after
work at the Mosque was finished but in any case before 755/
1354 when the Khatiiniyya was first endowed.

The frontal arches of the two iwéins are built of red and
cream-coloured ablaq voussoirs, and the coursing of the ablaq
masonry in the spandrels is adjusted in order to have the lower
courses coincide with the extrados of voussoirs of the same
colour. A simple splay-face moulding runs across the top and
down the west spandrel of the north zwan; the south van has
lost whatever frame moulding it might have had when a later
building was erected over it.
 The nortn 7Wan NOW Me€dsulo V.QOH TOT TOU LO DaCkK,
but Creswell’s photograph (plate 31.3) reveals that its rear
(north) wall has been rebuilt some time after 1920. The back of
the marble lining of the mibrab of the Arghiniyya is exposed in
the north-east corner of the zwdm, indicating that the wall here
is very thin indeed. Creswell’s photograph shows that the rear
wall of the ivan was on the same alignment as the north wall
of cell ‘A’. Immediately above the modern pavement at the
north end of the east wall of the zvdn the masonry contains
three voussoirs of what seems to be the remains of an arch. It
is not clear what the original purpose of this arch might have
been unless it belonged to the pre-existing Sufi’s cell
mentioned by al-‘Umari (see above). To the south of the arch is
a modern door (now blocked) that led into the tomb anteroom.
The original door is in a pointed-arched recess near the
southern end of the wall.

The south iwdn is shallower than the north one, being
3.65m from north to south. In the east wall is a pointed-arched
recess containing a grilled window (now blocked) that opened
to the assembly hall. A crudely arched recess in the rear (south)
wall contains a door into the east end of the passage giving
access to the lodgings (rub) on the north side of St al-
Qattanin (above, p. 280). Both door and recess appear to be
modern.

The decorated facade at the east end dominates the
courtyard (fig. 31.5). The lower part of the facade is built of red
and cream-coloured ablaq masonry and continues some way
into the zwdns at either end. This part of the facade that is built
of ablaq is framed by a quirked ogee moulding similar in
profile to the cornice above the cells, which extends
horizontally across the facade between the iwdms, then
descends vertically at either end and returns over coupled
brackets carrying the eastern springings of the zwan arches.
From there it continues south into the south zwvdm and north
into the north zwdn. In the south wan it frames the recess
containing the assembly hall window. In the north zwdan it
extends across the recess containing the door into the tomb
anteroom. Between these two arched recesses the facade
contains three openings (all blocked): a window to the tomb
chamber and a window and door to the assembly hall (plate
31.4). The two windows are each set in a shallow recess
 spanned by a pointed horseshoe arch. The tympanums are
decorated with an ablaq revetment radiating from a small
central hub. The wall surface between the two arches is
decorated with a similar radial ablaq revetment, which
enlivens this otherwise blank section of facade. The door into
the assembly hall is wider than the windows and is set in a
correspondingly wider recess with matching radial revetment
in the tympanum of its pointed arch. The lintels of all five
Openings are surmounted by ablag relieving arches.

The tops of stone benches flanking the assembly hall door
protrude approximately 0.30m above the surface of the packed
debris at this end of the courtyard; the original threshold level
 must be 0.35m or so below the present surface or, in other
words, about 1.13m above the present lower courtyard level.
However, through a gap in the paving beside the entrance to
cell ‘G’ at the west end of the courtyard may be seen earlier
paving stones that presumably belong to the original pavement
0.32m below the present pavement. Thus the threshhold of the
assembly hall door appears to be about 1.45m above the
original pavement in the west part of the courtyard.

The upper part of the facade is of plain limestone pierced
by two pointed-arched windows, one lighting the assembly hall
and one lighting the tomb chamber. The dome over the tomb
chamber is raised on a tall circular drum. The dome itself
collapsed in the winter of 1919-2076 and at some later date the
drum was rebuilt one course higher and the dome replaced
 with a pitiful concrete cap that bears no resemblance to the
original.””

The tomb chamber was reached by way of the anteroom
from the recessed doorway in the north ivan (plate 31.5). The
arch of this doorway springs from inward-facing coupled
elbow brackets. Each of these is attached to a similar coupled
bracket facing west. On the right side the west-facing bracket
carries the opening arch of the zzvdn (plate 31.6), confronting
a similar bracket at the west springing of that arch. The bracket
on the left, having no arch to support, is structurally redundant.
Each pair of coupled brackets is carved from a single block of
stone. In the tympanum of the doorway a recessed panel with
elaborately foliated ends appears to have been intended for an
inscription that was never carved. The top edge of the panel is
 broken by a crude round window made some time alter 1920.

The anteroom within that doorway is roofed by two cross
vaults separated by an east-west transverse arch. Two small
cupboards open in the north wall, and an irregular high-level
recess has been cut into the south half of the east (Haram) wall.
The north half of the east wall is hidden by a modern partition.
There is no sign of any windows except for the modern
opening above the entrance door. In the south wall of the
anteroom a wide doorway (now blocked) is framed by a simple
moulding with volute finials at the bottom partly masked by
modern paving (plate 31.7). This doorway led into the tomb
chamber.

The tomb chamber contains two cenotaphs. In the
southern part is a small gabled cenotaph, now coated with
cement, which presumably marks the grave of Oghul Khatin.
To the north is a grander cenotaph marking the recent grave of
the Hashemite Sharif, ‘Abd al-Hamid.

The chamber is almost square in plan with tall wall arches
in each side to reduce the central area under the dome to an
exact square. The north, west and south walls are constructed
of red and cream-coloured ablagq, as are the wall arches. The
east wall, which is the Haram wall, is plastered. Originally there
was in each of the three ablaq walls an opening spanned by a
lintel and an ab/aq relieving arch: in the north wall the entrance
from the anteroom; in the west wall a window to the courtyard;
and in the south wall a door or window to the assembly hall. All
these openings are now blocked. In the east wall was a window
opening on the Haram but this has been converted into a door,
which is now the only entrance to the chamber. Above the
ablaq masonry an ogee moulding runs round three sides of the
chamber at the springing level of the wall arches. Around the
extrados of the four arches a splay-face moulding articulates the
conjunction between the arches and the double-faceted
pendentives that make the transition from the square base to
the drum, which is eight-sided in the interior though the
exterior is circular. Pointed-arched windows open in each side
of the drum. The lower part of each of these windows is
blocked by the surrounding roof, presumably when the roof
was resurfaced at some time. There are two more windows,
one opening in the tympanum of the west wall arch and the
other in the corresponding position in the south wall arch.

The pendentives and the tympanums of the wall arches
originally bore a rich stucco decoration in relief That
decoration has now entirely disappeared, but the dilapidated
remains visible in Creswell’s 1920 photograph (plate 31.8)
suffice to convey a reasonably accurate impression of the
 overall scheme. The two pendentives shown in this photograph
are decorated alike with a swirling arabesque of interlacing
leafy tendrils, and the whole composition is enclosed within a
raised stucco border. The decoration of the tympanum is quite
different: a more formal composition framed by a fretted
border. Across the base of this border runs a frieze of
intersecting semicircles with trifoliate terminals to the
upturned points. There are two identical circular medallions
on either side of the window in the middle of the tympanum.
These contain a distinctive strapwork motif comprising a six-
pointed star interlaced with a six-lobed rosette (fig. 31.12) -a
common design in Islamic art and architecture.” A photograph
in the collection of the Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem” shows that
all four wall arches and pendentives were decorated
identically, which suggests that a mould or a stencil was used.

The assembly hall to the south of the tomb chamber was
originally reached from the courtyard through the recessed
entrance door described above. There was a second entrance,
now a window, from the Haram, and possibly a third from the
tomb chamber (see above). The only entrance nowadays is the
modern door from the Haram at the south end of the east wall
of the hall.

The floor of the hall has been raised about 0.40m. On it
stand modern cenotaphs marking the graves of five notables
buried here since 1930. The vaulting is in three bays with short
barrel vaults at the north and south ends and a folded cross
vault in the centre, which rises to an octagonal cupola at the
crown (see fig. 31.6). The three bays are separated by ablaq
transverse arches. The south, west and north walls are built in
ablaq masonry to a height of 2.99m where an ogee moulding
extends around the three walls. The whole of the east wall, that
is the pre-existing Haram wall, is plastered, as are the upper
parts of the other walls and the vaults. The two high-level
windows, opening on the courtyard and on the tomb chamber,
have screens of polychrome glass set in plaster tracery (plates
31.9 and 31.10). Both screens may be later insertions.

The entrance door from the courtyard is flanked by two
windows; all are now blocked. The door is set in a shallow
recess spanned by a trefoil arch composed of ablaq voussoits
(see plate 31.11), which may have been inspired by the nearby
ablaq trefoil arch at Bab al-Qattanin (above, p. 278). The
tympanum of the upper lobe of the arch is decorated with a
radial revetment similar to that of the exterior arch of the
doorway. The ogee moulding bends upwards here over the
head of the arch. The flanking windows are plain rectangular
embrasures in the ablag masonry of the walls, as is the opening
 to the tomb chamber in the north wall. The soffit of the second
masonry course above the lintels of the windows is undercut as
if to reduce the load on the lintels, while the lintel of the
opening in the north wall is surmounted by an ablagq relieving
arch.

The mibrab in the middle of the south wall is somewhat
squat in appearance due to the raising of the floor level. It is set
in an arched recess (see plate 31.11), the pointed horseshoe
arch of which has unsupported haunches, doubtless originally
sustained by nook-shafts. The conch is of coursed ablaq, below
which the curved interior of the niche is inlaid with five round-
headed vertical panels of red stone.

 TWO STAGES OF CONSTRUCTION?

Mujir al-Din records that the construction, first endowed in
755/1354 by Oghul Khatiin, was completed and re-endowed in
782/1380 by Isfahan Shah. The provision in the Arghiniyya of
an entrance passageway to the Khatiniyya shows that the
Khatiiniyya existed before the Arghiiniyya was constructed in
759/1358. That earlier construction must surely have included
the main assembly hall/tomb chamber/anteroom complex
beside the Haram wall. What more did it include? Or, to put the
question another way, what did Isfahan Shah’s ‘completion’
entail? There would appear to be three possibilities: (1) the
finishing of minor details of no great architectural significance;
(2) the addition of all or part of the two iwéins and cells that
enclose the courtyard; or (3) the addition of an upper
extension above the Haram portico.

About the first possibility we can say little except that the
present building, despite later alterations and additions, has the
appearance of a homogeneous whole.

The second possibility nevertheless deserves careful
consideration for there are certain irregularities in the design
and construction of the two ivédns in particular. The north
iwan is barrel-vaulted and has a pointed frontal arch composed
of twenty-nine voussoirs, whereas the south ivan is cross-
vaulted and its frontal arch is slightly horseshoed and
composed of only twenty-five smaller voussoirs. Moreover, the
frontal arch of the south iwén masks the vertical run of the
quirked ogee moulding in the facade at the east end of the

 courtyard. The moulding returns above the coupled elbow
brackets supporting the east springer of that ivan in an
awkward fashion as if the bracket were a later insertion. The
bracket itself is the only one that is damaged, which might have
happened if it was lying around for some time before being
used. Furthermore, the vault of the iwédn obscures part of the
continuation of the moulding over the assembly hall window
(see fig. 31.5). At the north iwén, on the other hand, the
moulding is obviously an integral part of both the facade and
the springer of the iwvédn’s frontal arch. We may conclude,
therefore, that the south iwdén is a later addition, perhaps part
of Isfahan Shah’s ‘completion’. All the cells around the
courtyard, surmounted by a continuous cornice moulding
similar to that on the facade of the complex beside the Haram
wall, appear, however, to form part of the earlier construction.
This would explain why the long entrance passageway had to
lead through one of the cells to give access to the courtyard.

Of the third possibility — that Isafahan Shah added an
extension over the Haram portico — all that can be said is that
there was indeed a structure above the portico but there are
indications that it formed part of the Ribat al-Zamani (below, p.
576) or the ‘Uthmaniyya (below, p. 550). If the latter were true
it is conceivable that there might have been some confusion
between the founder of the ‘Uthminiyya and the completer of
the Khatiniyya for both were called Isfahan Shah. That
structure above the portico was demolished in 1925.
 23 There are two single elbow brackets in the window recesses on the Haram
facade of the Tankiziyya (above, p. 229). Van Berchem (CIA (Ville), 207 n.1) gives
a list of Crusader examples as well as referring to the remarkable ‘Islamic’
example at the ‘Ala’ al-Din Mosque (617/1220) in Konya. He also refutes de
Vogiié’s inexplicable contention that the device is Arab in origin (CIA (Ville), 207.
n.2). RW. Hamilton, The Structural History of. the Aqsa Mosque, London, 1949, 45,
suggests that ‘the device may well have originated in the consoles carrying
colonnettes or arches which are to be seen in some north Syrian churches of the
sixth century’.

27 The original dome is barely discernible in C/A (Planches), cvi.

28 Early examples are found on painted tie beams from the Aqsa Mosque (R.W.
Hamilton, op. cit., 76, Fig. 35, E6). Others have been recorded as far afield as
Afghanistan (A.D.H. Bivar, ‘Seljiiqid Ziyarats of Sar-i Pul (Afghanistan)’, BSOAS,
xxix, 1966, 57-63, pl. III) and Bulgaria (G. Migeon, ‘Orfévrerie d'argent de style
oriental trouvée au Bulgarie’, Syria, iii, 1922, 141-44, pl. xxx). There are many
other examples in different materials from different periods, and so this motif is
obviously unreliable as a dating criterion (cf. AS. Melikian-Chirvani, Le Bronze
Iranien, Paris, 1973, 12-13).

","a Le

The madrasa is quasi-cruciform in plan with zvdns opening on
the east, south and west sides of a vaulted courtyard and an
entrance vestibule in the form of a lower and narrower fourth
iwan (now blocked) on the north side, which we shall call the
‘vestibule-iwam’. At the crown of the vaulting over the
courtyard is a large octagonal oculus, now closed. There is a
mibrab in the qibla wall of the south iwan.

The corners between the iwdns are occupied by rooms
serving various purposes. The most important of these is a
tomb chamber at the north-east corner which has two
windows, one opening on the street and one on the Haram. The
south-east corner has a cross-vaulted room with doors into
both the Haram and the east idan, providing now the only
means of access to the courtyard of the madrasa. The room in
the south-west corner is sealed off. The north-west corner
contains a small room, a well-niche and a staircase leading to an
upper floor, which comprises five small rooms.

Included within the eastern boundary of the complex is a
long passageway leading to the Khatiiniyya (no. 31).
 "
33,"Il HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

The extant inscription (see the translation below) identifies
beyond doubt this building situated on the south side of the
quiet street leading to the Bab al-Hadid.

DATE

A completion date after the death of the founder is
communicated by the inscription, the original of which has
been edited by van Berchem,' and confirmed by Mujir al-Din.
First the inscription:

In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate. The
construction of this blessed tomb and madrasa was
ordered by his most noble excellency Sayf al-Din Arghtn
al-Kamili, the former Governor of the Province of
Damascus. He died {and passed] to the mercy of God
Almighty on the 28 Shawwal in the year seven hundred
and fifty-eight. Rukn al-Din Baybars al-Sayfi took charge of
the building and its completion. It was completed in Rabi‘

II of the year seven hundred and fifty-nine [13 March-10
April 1358].

The building was finished under the superintendence of
 someone who may have been one of the mamliks of Arghtn.
Yet to make this assumption, as van Berchem did,” on the basis
of the 72isba ‘al-Sayfi’, when the honorific Sayf al-Din was borne
by so many, owes more to a sense of the fitness of things than
it does to solid evidence.

Mujir al-Din’s text is as follows:

The Arghtiniyya Madrasa at the Bab al-Hadid was endowed
by Arghtn al-Kamili, the Governor of Syria. He was the
person who renewed the Bab al-Hadid, one of the gates of
the Haram. At one time the gate was known as the Arghtin
Gate.* He died on Thursday, 26 Shawwal’ in the year seven
hundred and fifty-eight in Jerusalem, and he was buried
there. The construction of it was completed after his death
in the year fifty-nine.

FOUNDER

Since Arghiin is said to have been less than thirty when he
died, he could not have been born before 728/1328. Therefore
he would have been at the most seventeen when he was given
an amirate of 40 by Sultan al-Salih Isma‘il in Shawwal 745/
February 1345.’ He was mamliik of the Sultan, who was himself
still in his teens. His brief career started with good connections.
He married the Sultan’s half sister, a child of her mother’s
union with the regent, Arghin al-Ala’i. Arghin al-Kamili was
initially known as ‘the Younger’ (al-Saghir). He probably held
the court post of jamdér (Master of the Robes) at this time, the
blazon of which office appears in the inscription of the
Arghtniyya.

Under al-Kamil Sha‘ban, Arghiin was advanced to the rank
of Amir of 100° and his misba changed by royal command to ‘al-
Kamili’.” During a visit to Jerusalem, a visit full of profit and
honour, severe sanctions were threatened against anyone who
continued to refer to him as ‘the Younger’.’° After a brief set-
back to his career in 747/1346, Arghin, restored to his high
rank, was sent as governor to Aleppo, where he continued till
Rajab 752/September 1351.'! Transferred to Damascus, he
remained loyal to Cairo during the rebellion of Baybugha Ris,
his successor in Aleppo. With the rebellion checked and the
participants hunted down and executed, and a successful
expedition against the Dhulghadir lands completed, Arghtn
reached the high point of his career.!? As Maqrizi tells us:
‘Despite his young years, he had four mamliks who were
amirs, his son aged three was an amir of 100, the sources of
whose amirate were on his death added to the fief of the
Governor (of Aleppo) [i.e. Arghiin’s], and four members of his
 family, who had arrived as immigrants, held four amirates’!

After al-Nasir Hasan returned for his second reign in 755/
1354, Arghiin was recalled to Cairo and replaced in Aleppo by
Taz (see p. 399). In Egypt Arghiin was given an amirate of 100,
but in circumstances that are not explained he was arrested in
Safar 756/February 1355, and sent to prison in Alexandria.'
Later he was ordered to Jerusalem with battdl status, where, as
we have seen he died in 758/1357,” with the Arghiniyya, which
he had embarked upon, about five months or so from
completion.

In Cairo, as part of the royal favour shown him, Arghtin had
been given the means to erect a fine palace on the banks of
Elephant Lake.'° In 755/1354, as governor of Aleppo, he had
endowed a hospital in that city, and at Jerusalem, in addition to
this present tomb and madrasa complex, he built and endowed
a school for the study of the Koran (dar Qur'an) and a ribat.'*®
 ENDOWMENT

The only endowments of which anything is known were
located at Hisn al-Akrad (Krak des Chevaliers) which came
under the administration of Tripoli. They consisted of half the
village of A’naz, the mill there and three fifths of the mazra ‘a of
al-Jandaliyya.""? A record of the change of agent for the
collection of waqf revenue for the year 945/1538-39 mentions
that the lease agreement was drawn up in the court of the
Tripoli Qadi.”°

MAMLUK PERIOD
There is not a single reference to the Arghiiniyya in the Haram
documents, as far as can be ascertained.

According to Mujir al-Din, the Qadi Sa‘d al-Din Sa‘d al-
Dayri (d.867/1462-63) studied much of ‘The Guidance in Law’
under a certain Hanafi shaykh, ‘Ala’ al-Din ‘Ali b. al-Naqib, in
 the Arghtiniyya Madrasa.2! However, there is no certainty that
that was part of a regular public course.” It could have been a
private arrangement in effectively private accommodation.
One should note the case of the Qadi Ghars al-Din Khalil al-
Kinani, a former shaykh of the Salahiyya, and therefore most
certainly a Shafi'7, who returned to Jerusalem in 879/1475 in the
hope of benefiting from his friendship with the newly
appointed governor, Jar Qutli al-Zahiri, and took up residence
in the Arghiiniyya.” Some years later, a governor of Jerusalem
and Superintendent of the Two Harams, Amir Khidr Beg, lived
in the Arghiiniyya, as one gathers from the fact that, after his
death in Sha‘ban 897/June 1492, his brother and successor,
Janbalat, came with witnesses to recover effects, including 700
dinars, which had been sealed ‘in a cupboard in his brother's
house in the Arghtiniyya Madrasa’, but, as it happened, found
the chest broken into and the money gone.”

OTTOMAN PERIOD

Scattered references to the Arghtniyya in the Jerusalem Court
records mainly concern appointments and salaries. In Jumada
Il 968/February 1561 the mudarris, Shams al-Din Muhammad
b. Zayn al-Din was paid three previous years’ salary at the rate
of nine aspers a day.”’ A Koran ‘readership’ in the Arghiniyya
was one of seven posts held in different institutions by Muhyi
al-Din b. Jama‘a up to his death in 982/1575. Close relatives
followed him in all of them, except that the Arghiiniyya post
went to Badr al-Din Muhammad b. Jamal al-Din b. Abi al-Lutf, a
Shafi'.”° In 1021/1612 a similar post was inherited by one
member of the Ibn al-Samit family from another.”

The Defterdar of Damascus instructed the inspector and
his wakil — they were brothers, members of the Ibn Abi al-Lutf
family — to apply the revenue of 979/1571-72 and subsequent
years if necessary to the repair of the. madrasa and ‘to give
precedence to the repair of the fabric over the payment of
salaries’. The estimated expenditure was as follows;?8

To repair of 3 zvdans, 2 rooms and new paving for
 Total 4,084 paras

The revenue of 981/1573-74 amounted to 61 gold pieces,
that is 2,440 paras. Official salaries took 45 and fourteen Koran
readers received 15, since one person had two gold pieces. The
mudarris, who was Muhammad b. Abi al-Wafa’ al-Husayni al-
Hanafi received 20, the inspector (the same person as the
mudarris) 9, the Shaykh of the madrasa, Shams al-Din b. Abi al-
Lutf, 5. The clerk also received 5 and the bawwdab and the
attendance clerk 3 each. That left one for administrative costs in
Tripoli and Jerusalem.”

By 1020/1611 the mutawalli was ‘Abd al-Qadir b. Ajmal b.
al-Dahhan. He managed to collect only 88 out of 100 piastres
owing to the waqf, and paid out 141. Recipients of 56% piastres
were fifteen faqirs (sic).*°

Asali has noted a number of other appointments within the
Arghiiniyya recorded in the sijills. In the late eighteenth century
the post of shaykh went to a member of the al-‘Afifi family, and

the madrasa became known as ‘Afifi House because of their
occupation of it.!

MODERN HISTORY

The courtyard and iwéins of the madrasa were refurbished in
1931 when King Husayn I, leader of the Arab Revolt during
World War I, was buried in the east zvan. An inscription built
into the Haram wall above the window Opening into the east
iwan records his death and burial. At that time the opening
between the vestibule-ivdn and the courtyard was blocked.

The tomb chamber was cleaned and repaired in 1982 by
the Islamic Archaeology Department of the Awqaf
Administration.

The upper floors of the building are still usedas.a dwelling
by members of the ‘Afifi family.
 "
33,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","IV ARCHIIFRCIURE

THE HARAM PORTICO

This portico next to the Arghtniyya was erected in 736/1335-
36.* At Bab al-Hadid three flying buttresses (visible in plate
35.7) were added to support the structure, presumably after the
assembly halls of the Jawhariyya (no. 58) and the Muzhiriyya
(no. 62) had been built on the roof of the portico in the ninth/
fifteenth century. These buttresses and the adjacent seven bays
of the portico were demolished and the portico was rebuilt
after the 1927 earthquake.*? The present appearance of the
portico together with analysis of the variation in span between
the arches suggests that the rebuilding closely followed the
lines of the original arrangement.

HARAM FRONTAGE (fig. 32.6)

The original appearance of the frontage under the portico is
difficult to determine since the Haram wall has been recently
refaced. The present aspect of the openings is modern but they
must all be original. A doorway like the present one into the
Haram from the south-east corner room would have provided
a bent entrance according with Mujir al-Din’s statement that the
Arghiniyya had direct access to the Haram.? The window
opening into the east zwdan, shown as a blocked recess in van
Berchem’s sketch plan made in 1914,° was presumably
re-opened in 1931 when King Husayn I was buried in the east
iwan of the madrasa. Similarly the window into the tomb
chamber, also shown as a recess in van Berchem’s sketch,
would have been re-opened then. Certainly it would be unusual
if the tomb chamber beside the Haram gate did not have a
window opening on the Haram as well as the one opening on
the street.*° Since al-Umari mentions no openings in this
stretch of the Haram wall, these openings must have been
introduced with the construction of the Arghiiniyya.

BAB AL-HADID (plate 32.1)

Mujir al-Din records that Bab al-Hadid was renewed
(istajadda) by Arghiin al-Kamili and that it was once known as
Bab Arghiin.’’ Al-‘Umari, writing about ten years before Arghtin
arrived in Jerusalem, described an earlier gate ‘called Bab al-
Hadid . . . its height is 4% dbira‘ and its width 2%4 dhira’*®
Taking al-‘Umari’s dhird‘ to measure 0.69m (above, p. 33 n. 11)
his measurements give a height of 3.10m and a width of 1.84m.
The present gate aperture measures 3.07m by 1.83m, so it
would appear that Arghiin’s renewal of the gate retained the
dimensions of the original.
 STREET FACADE (fig. 32.5, plate 32.2)

With a tall entrance portal placed centrally between two large
windows, the disposition of the street facade would be quite
symmetrical were it not for a short westward extension to
incorporate the entrance to the Khatiniyya. The lower part of
the facade is constructed in ablaq of red and cream-coloured
stone. As is customary, the ablaq masonry is bounded by a
quirked ogee moulding (fig. 32.5), which rises in a high pish-
taq over the main entrance. At the west end of the facade the
moulding makes a curious return emphatically to exclude the
Khatiiniyya entrance from the ablaq construction — in this way
the Khatiiniyya entrance is visually separated from the
Arghiniyya although structurally the two are integrated.

In addition to the two large windows there are two
insignificant openings in the ablaq masonry, one above the
Khattniyya entrance and one above the large western window.
At roughly the same level a strainer arch of more recent
construction, almost certainly Ottoman, spans the street to
buttress the facade (see above, p. 147). The upper part of the
facade above the moulding is of plain limestone.

Two steps, semicircular in plan, lead up to the entrance
door set in a pointed-arched recess spanned by a cloister vault
(plate 32.3). As usual, stone benches flank the doorway. Above
 the benches the stonework of both outer corners of the recess
is rounded off in the form of diminutive engaged columns
2.20m high with vase capitals and bases. The door opening
itself is trimmed with a delicate moulding (fig. 32.4) which,
most unusually, does not circumscribe the ablag masonry but
 is carved across it.*? Above this moulding the dating inscription
extends across the width of the recess (plate 32.4). The two
blazons contained within the inscription have been published
repeatedly. L.A. Mayer describes the blazon as a ‘napkin on the
middle field of a three-fielded shield’, the badge of the jamdar,
master of the robes.“° Traces of red paint survive in the middle
field of both shields. The colours of Arghiin’s blazon — gold
rhomb in centre of red middle field, top and bottom fields
white — are known from a glazed pottery shard in the Citadel
Museum in Aleppo. In the centre of each side wall of the recess,
at the same height as the inscription on the rear wall, faint traces
of pencil and plaster mark two circles. These may originally
have been decorated with blazons. Immediately above the
lintel is a revetment of three inlaid marble slabs with
interlocking trefoils to represent the joggled voussoirs of a flat
relieving arch, slightly undercut over the middle of the lintel.
This in turn is surmounted by a course of ablag joggling which
extends around the portal recess and across the facade. A plain
rectangular window pierces the rear wall of the recess above
the door to admit daylight to a small room (marked ‘E’ on the
upper floor plan, fig. 32.4) above the vestibule-iwén.

The two large windows in the facade are decorated like the
doorway with mouldings around the openings and marble
lintels (part of a continuous course of marble). The course
above is here enlivened by an inlaid marble slab with
interlocking trefoils (plate 32.2). Above this the course of
joggling is very slightly arcuated as if to relieve the load in the
lintels. The eastern window, belonging to the tomb chamber,
retains its original iron grille, while at the western window the
sill has been lowered to form a doorway into the small room
there (which, incidentally, houses a sweet shop).

The frontage of the Khatiniyya entrance (fig. 32.5)
consists of a simple pointed-arched opening built exclusively
in cream-coloured limestone. As if further to segregate this
entrance from the main construction, a shallow muqarnas
frieze supervenes on the returning quirked ogee moulding just
above and to the left of the opening (fig. 32.5). The jambs are
lightly chamfered up to the height of the springing of the arch.
There is a similar though deeper chamfer apparently intended
to prevent detrition of the north-western corner of the
building; it was rendered obsolete by the contiguous
construction of the Muzhiriyya (no. 62).

The entrance leads into a long groin-vaulted passage. In
five narrow recesses in the west wall and one in the east wall of
this passage remnants of earthenware pipes are still
discernible. These pipes were presumably intended to channel
rainwater from the roof into the underground cistern whose
 well-head is to be found next to the staircase (below, p. 363). A
blocked opening or recess (marked ‘a’ on the plan, fig. 32.3) in
the west wall of the passage has a very low head only 1.20m
above the floor. The original purpose of this opening is not
known.

Several features of the facade such as the high pish-tdq of
the portal, the extensive use of ablaq, the continuous band of
joggling and the muqarnas frieze at the Khatiniyya entrance
recall the distinctive architectural style of Mamlak tombs at
Damascus in the quarter known as al-Maydan,""! and it would
appear therefore that Arghiin, a former governor of Damascus,
had employed craftsmen from this provincial capital to design
and build his funerary monument in Jerusalem.

MADRASA (plan, fig. 32.3)

The straight access through the vestibule from the street into
the courtyard is another typically Syrian feature. The courtyard,
square in plan, is roofed with a folded cross vault rising toa
large octagonal recess at the crown (plate 32.6). Without doubt
this recess originally opened into a lantern dome (one of the
two domes mentioned in the list of projected repairs drawn up
 in 979/1571-72, see p. 358 above) to light and ventilate the
courtyard. A similar lantern dome, though smaller in relation to
the vaulted surface, survives at the Almalikiyya (above, p. 314,
Jig. 26.7). The dome was removed and the oculus blocked some
time before 1914 (when van Berchem photographed the
interior), presumably when the floor above was taken over for
a dwelling.

The vault over the courtyard is supported by the frontal
arches of the cross-vaulted zwdans on the east, south and west
sides, and a fourth identical though blind arch on the north side
enclosing the much smaller segmental-arched opening of the
vestibule-zvdn, which is decorated with a double quirked ogee
moulding (fig. 32.11). A small window (now blocked) in the
tympanum of that blind arch formerly opened into a room over
the vestibule-iwdan. Van Berchem’s photographs (C/A
(Planches), \xix upper and lower) show that the walls of the
iwans were built of ashlar masonry. The vaults, built of rubble
masonry, are plastered as usual.

A slightly corbelled string course runs around the iwans
just below the springing of the arches. This string course is
decorated with a repeating shallow mugarnas element similar
 to that on the facade at the Khatiiniyya entrance. At the north
side the string course is bent up over the apex of the pointed
segmental arch of the vestibule-ivdan (fig. 32.11). Today the
walls are lined with blockboard up to the height of the string
course (plate 32.5). Above the string course the walls and vaults
are plastered; only the voussoirs of the arches are exposed.
 The mibrab in the rear (gibla) wall of the south iwan,
semicircular in plan, has a stilted pointed arch (plate 32.7).
Creswell’s photograph (plate 32.8) shows how it looked in
1920, with ill-fitting unmatched nook-shafts evidence of some
rough-and-ready repair. It was refurbished in 1931 when a new
capital was made for the left-hand shaft. (The original capital,
undiscovered by the refurbishers, was found by us in the room
over the vestibule-iwdn: see plate 32.9.) The lowest masonry
course of the gibla wall is plain limestone but above that, up to
the level of the springing of the mibrab arch, the wall is faced
with upright oblong panels of polychrome marble. Above the
marble panelling the wall is built in ablagq masonry up to the
muqarnas string course. The mibrab is framed by a rectangular
quirked ogee moulding which, like the moulding on the
facade, is carved across the ablaq masonry. The upper part of
the qibla wall was open when van Berchem visited but, as he
surmised, that opening was probably made when the lantern
dome was removed. There is now above the mihrab a
rectangular window of coloured glass set in carved stucco.

Two tall brass candlesticks now flank the mihrdab (plate
32.7). They both have inscriptions around their necks
recording that they were made for the Ottoman Sultan ‘Abd al-
Hamid II in 1306/1888-89 for the Aqsa Mosque. Many of the
carpets on the floor bear tags dated 1378/1958-59.

The other zwdns are decorated slightly differently in each
case. The west iwdn has in the centre of its south wall a
recessed doorway to the south-west corner room, which has
been blocked up. Shallow recesses of a similar size occupy the
centre of the west and north walls of the ivéd. There are three
 openings in the corresponding positions in the east iwén: the
one in the north wall communicates with the tomb chamber;
that in the east wall is a window to the Haram and that in the
south wall a doorway leading into the south-east corner room.
A large cenotaph in this east zwén marks the grave of King
Husayn I. It is covered by a gabled timber frame supporting a
beautiful gold-embroidered green brocade (kiswa) made in
1366/1946-47 by ‘Uthman ‘Abd al-Hamid the embroiderer (al-
qasabaji) in Khan al-Khalili in Cairo.
 The east zwdn (4.29m deep) is somewhat deeper than
either the south #véin (3.82m deep) or the west zwan (3.81m
deep). Normally the south zwan would be the deepest (cf. the
Tankiziyya, above, p. 232). Van Berchem has surmised that the
reason for this anomaly was ‘the configuration of the site that
the architect had to deal with, and which led him to sacrifice
this detail for the sake of the overall effect’. Our survey reveals
the more specific reason. By comparing the plan (fig. 32.3) with
the street elevation (fig. 32.5) it can be seen that the extra depth
of the east iwdén is an unavoidable concomitant of the
symmetrical facade. The pre-existing Haram wall serves as the
rear wall of the east iwdn whereas the rear wall of the west
iwan had to be built entirely anew. The position of this rear
wall of the west ivdn was restricted by the obligation to
provide a passage to meet the cell on the north side of the
courtyard to the Khatiiniyya. Turning to the facade, which is
symmetrical about the entrance portal, we see that at the east
end the vertical moulding abuts on the Haram wall, i.e. in line
with the rear wall of the east zd. But at the west end of the
fagade proper (excluding the extension for the Khatiniyya
 entrance) the moulding is not in line with the rear wall of the
west zwdn, being 0.48m to the west of it. Since the courtyard is
also centred on the entrance portal, it follows that the west
zwan is 0.48m shallower than the east zwan.

As for the south zwan, since the north-south depth of the
site was restricted by the street to the north and the Khatiniyya
to the south, there was insufficient space to develop a
conventional four-iwvdn layout and at the same time have a
symmetrical facade. If the entrance portal had occupied a
corner then there would have been room for matching north
and south ivdans. But the designer opted for the symmetrical
facade with the entrance taking up the space which might
otherwise have accommodated a north ivén. Consequently
the north and south zwédms were reduced to the minimum, the
south zvdn matching the depth of the west zwdn and the north
‘vestibule-iwvan’ occupying the remaining space between the
courtyard and the entrance doorway.

The north-west corner of the madrasa houses a small
barrel-vaulted room with a window (now a door) opening on
the street, the staircase to the upper floor, and a trefoil-headed
well-niche (section, fig. 32.10). A shaft above the well allows
water to be drawn to the upper floor. Opposite the well-niche
is a recess under the staircase.

TOMB CHAMBER

In the north-east corner of the complex the tomb chamber has
—as noted above — one window opening on the street beside
the Haram gate, one on the Haram and another in the south
wall communicating with the east ivan. It is entered through a
door in its west wall, opening from the vestibule-ivan (plate
32.10). An anepigraphic cenotaph in the middle of the floor
marks the founder’s grave. Next to the cenotaph a stone trap
door (plate 32.11) gives access to five steps leading down to the
burial vault (see sections, figs. 32.8 and 32.10). The present
occupants of the upper floors of the building say that a second
burial vault beside this one contains the remains of the
founder’s wife and family. There is a second trap door (see
plan, fig. 32.3) but we did not open it. The texts make no
mention of a second grave.

The cross-vaulted ceiling of the tomb chamber is a later
insertion. Originally the chamber, square in plan, was domed
(with the second of the two domes mentioned in the 979/1571-
72 list of projected repairs, see p. 358 above). The axonometric
reconstruction (fig. 31.9) shows the relationship between the
two domes. The dome must have been replaced by a cross vault
to allow the construction of the present room over the chamber
some time after 979/1571-72 (sections, figs. 32.8 and 32.10).
 UPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 32.4)
A door in the west wall of the entrance vestibule opened at the
foot of the staircase to the upper floor. The pitch of the stairs has
been reduced somewhat by the addition of new treads for the
lower steps and the addition of two new steps at the bottom,
obstructing the swing of the original door, which has been
removed. Originally the lowest step was in line with a 0.36m
southward return in the south wall of the staircase (see ground
floor plan, fig. 32.3).

The staircase leads up to a corridor (plate 32.12) that runs
south above the Khatiniyya passageway, past a stairway to the
roof, to give access to a long room (A) roofed by three cross
 vaults (plate 32.13). A door in the east wall of that room opens
into across-vaulted room (B) over the (blocked) south-western
corner room of the madrasa, which has two windows (now
blocked), one opening into the south ivan and the other into
the west iwdn. A later high-level window has been opened in
the south wall.

At the north end of the corridor there is a cross-vaulted
chamber (C), now a latrine, with a small window overlooking
the street. Three steps lead east from this end of the corridor
up to an L-shaped landing (plate 32.14) from which two rooms
are entered: a vaulted room (D) which also has a window
overlooking the street, and the cross-vaulted room (E) over the
 vestibule-iwvan. The latter room has a window opening in the
rear wall of the portal and another (now blocked) into the
courtyard of the madrasa to the south. A recess in the north wall
of the landing originally housed a shaft to allow water to be
drawn up from the well-head below.

These upper floor rooms may have been intended to serve
as Arghiin’s temporary living quarters during his enforced
retirement in Jerusalem. Since he died before completion of
the building they would never have served as such, however,
and must have been used to accommodate the madrasa’s
officials.

The staircase on the west side of the upper floor corridor
rises to the roof, which was originally unbuilt upon. Several
rooms of Ottoman and later construction now occupy the roof
(plan, fig. 62.5; plate 32.15).

which was reached from the Haram through Bab al-Hadid. As van Berchem
suggests (CIA (Ville), 283) Arghiin’s work at Bab al-Hadid was probably
contemporaneous with the construction of the madrasa.

39 Analogous examples of a moulding around the doorway and the rounding-off
of the corners of the recess are to be found at the Maristan of Arghiin in Aleppo,
built four years earlier in 755/1354 and otherwise quite dissimilar from his
madrasa in Jerusalem. The Aleppo maristin appears to have been built by local
craftsmen (C/A (Alep), 332-38) while the madrasa in Jerusalem was probably built
by craftsmen from Damascus.

34,"Il SITE AND BUILDING (fig. 33.2)
","eee er a ee eer ep ee er tee a

A restoration of the building in 1346/1927-28 explains its
exceptionally fine condition, albeit incorporating some
modifications. Creswell’s photographs (plates 33.1-33.6) taken
before the restoration have enabled us to establish the
relatively minor nature of these modifications.

The main building is entirely above the level of the portico
which was erected in several stages before the construction of
the rooms above. Access is by means of the staircase built
initially to serve the Almalikiyya. The entrance door at the
upper landing of the staircase is not the original one which
must, however, have been nearby.

A massive wall four metres thick, almost certainly a vestige
of the ancient Tower Antonia (see above, p. 43), divides the
building into two parts, north and south. The northern part is
linked to the southern part by a tunnel-vaulted recess (which
we shall call the ‘inner porch’) hewn out of the ancient wall.
The present entrance opens directly into this inner porch.

Next to the present entrance doorway a second door in the
south wall of the inner porch opens into a large vaulted hall
(which we shall call the ‘assembly hall’) over the portico. A
door in the east wall of that hall leads into an eastern domed
chamber, while a similar door in the west wall leads into a
somewhat larger western domed chamber, possibly a later
addition. The assembly hall and its ancillary domed chambers
overlook the Haram to the south. A mihrab in the centre of the
qibla wall of the hall has a curious external salient.

To the north of the inner porch is a high wan which forms
the south (qibla) end of an open courtyard. A deep iwan-like
recess in the west wall of the gibla iwan contains a cenotaph
marking the grave of some unspecified person, presumably the
founder. The courtyard is enclosed on the remaining three
sides by two storeys of cells; the roof of the upper storey is level
with the roof of the gibla iwan. There is an elaborately vaulted
well-niche in the west wall. Entered from the north-east corner
of the courtyard, a spiral staircase gives access to the upper
cells.

This must have been a difficult site on which to build, with
space to extend westwards above a portico along the face of the
escarpment of Antonia but only a strip of land extending
northwards (bounded to the east by the Almalikiyya and to the
west by vestiges of the Antonia) separated from the area above
the portico by the massive southern wall of the Antonia. The
inherent limitations of the site were overc

\ ome by siting the
residential unit further to the east and linking it with the
 construction over the portico by means of a porch cut into the
massive Antonia wall. The altogether harmonious and practical
layout so achieved bears witness to the skill and ingenuity of the
builders, while the consistently high quality of the
workmanship and materials reflects the affluence of the
founder.

Al-‘Umari calls the Is‘ardiyya ‘khanqah’ while Mujir al-Din
invariably refers to it as ‘madrasa’. There is no way of telling
which of these purposes, if not both, the building was originally
intended to serve. It has an zwdan as do most madrasas and it
also has a majma‘ as do all kbanqdbs (see above, p. 88).
 "
34,"III HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

In his description of the north wall of the Haram al-‘Umari
writes of the last section of the portico to the west of the
Dawadariyya Gate (called by him the Gate of the Glory of the
Prophets) as follows:

Above it are situated the Madrasa of the Amir Sayf al-Din al-
Hajj Almalik, the Bearer of the Polo-stick, and the Khanqah
of Majd al-Din al-Is‘ardi, the merchant. At the beginning of
it near the cistern which I have mentioned are the steps
which lead up to the madrasa and the khanqah.’

Al-Umari also states that the Dome of Sulayman (Qubbat
Sulayman) on the north side of the Haram is directly opposite
the steps which give access to the Is‘ardiyya Khangah and the
Madrasa of Sayf al-Din Almalik.?

Further confirmation is given by Mujir al-Din who, in his
progressive description of the north side of the Haram, deals
with the Is‘ardiyya between the Subaybiyya Madrasa and the
Almalikiyya?

DATE

The only precise date recorded is that of the waqf, which is
given by Mujir al-Din as 20 Rabi‘ I 760/19 February 1359. This
is the date given by the two Bodleian manuscripts‘ and explains
why Sauvaire in his translation gave the year as 760 without
comment,’ although the printed text he used and the more
recent one both read 770.

However, the fact that the Is‘ardiyya features in the text of
al-Umari would appear to prove that it was already in existence
around about 745/1345, when he visited Jerusalem. A gap of at
least fourteen years between the building and the endowment
 deed need not disturb us unduly. The Taliniyya Madrasa was
built before 800/1397 and no waqf document was drawn up
before 827/1424, which means a gap of at least twenty-seven
years in that case.’

FOUNDER
Al-‘Umari in the extract translated above attributed the khanqah
to a merchant called Majd al-Din al-Is‘ardi. His full name is
preserved for us by Mujir al-Din® as follows: al-Khwaja Majd al-
Din ‘Abd al-Ghani b. Sayf al-Din Abi Bakr b. Yusuf al-Is‘ardi. By
his name he originated from Is‘ard, the modern Siirt, south-
west of Lake Van in Turkey. It is interesting to note that two
persons with the misba al-Is‘ardi appear in the Haram
documents at the end of the fourteenth century. Both died in
Jerusalem, while the heirs of one of them still lived in Is‘ard.?
No further information is available for the founder as
named by Mujir al-Din. A great merchant in Damascus called al-
Hasan b. ‘Abd al-Wali al-Is‘ardi died early in 801/autumn 1398.1°
Whether he had any family connection with the merchant
Burhan al-Din Ibrahim b. Mubarak Shah al-Is‘ardi (d. 826/1423)
who built an Is‘ardiyya Madrasa in Damascus,!! is not known.
Nor is it known that our Majd al-Din was related to these later
merchants from Is‘ard. However, it is stated that the relatives of
Burhan al-Din Ibrahim formed a sizeable clan, and the
importance of the trading community from Is‘ard is plainly
demonstrated.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

There is no mention of the endowments of the khangah in
either of the Ottoman Defters available to us, which means only
that any rent from lands came from outside Palestine. A lease
agreement dated 1007/1599 proves that the Is‘ardiyya owned
some urban property within Jerusalem."" A few years earlier, in
962/1555, the Is‘ardiyya Madrasa (sic) featured as the southern
boundasy of a house described as ‘near the Dawadariyya
Gate’.

Another Sijill entry quoted by Asali recorded the
appointment of a Yanus Effendi al-Khalili to one third of each
of the top three posts in the ‘madrasa’, those of inspector,
administrator and shaykh, in the year 1168/1754-5, and also the
confirmation of his residence there.'* One surmises that the
Is‘ardiyya’s days as a fully functioning institution were already
over.

MODERN HISTORY
An inscription in the south wall of the inner porch
commemorates the fact that:

The Supreme Muslim Council has renewed the
construction Gaddada ‘imdrat) of this madrasa and has
made it into a library in the year 1346 of the Hijra of the
Prophet (1927-28).

The library was to be known as ‘Dar Kutub al-Masjid al-Aqsa’.
Part of the building was used as a dwelling; there are various
graffiti in the name of Nasib Bitar, sometime qadi ofJerusalem,
who resided there in 1946. Now the Aqsa Mosque Library has
found new accommodation in the Ashrafiyya (no. 63) and the
whole building serves as a dwelling.
 "
34,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","HARAM FAGADE (fig. 33.6)
The facade on to the Haram has the appearance of having been
erected in several phases. The eastern bay of the supporting
portico and the entrance staircase were built initially as part of
the substructure of the Almalikiyya. The portico and the
assembly hall supported by it were built against that staircase,
and the eastern domed chamber built over it. Later on, the
westernmost bay of the portico and the domed chamber above
were added after the completion of the assembly hall as their
structural discontinuity indicates: the westernmost bay breaks
bond with the assembly hall and its supporting portico.
Al-“Umari mentions only the three piers supporting the
 two bays of portico under the assembly hall beyond which he
says there is only an open space. We may deduce therefore that
the main part of the Is‘ardiyya was built after 741/1340 (the date
of construction of the adjoining Almalikiyya) but before 743/
1342-43 when this part of al-‘Umari’s text was written, and that
the western domed chamber was added some time after 743/
1342.

These phases of construction would seem, however, to
have followed in close succession as part of a deliberate plan to
emulate the facade of the Almalikiyya. In both cases the
assembly hall is contained between projecting buttresses rising
the full height of the facade. The western buttress of the
Almalikiyya defines the eastern limit of the Is‘ardiyya facade.
This was subsequently matched by a similar buttress
determining the western limit.

The tripartite facade indicates the layout of rooms behind.
The long assembly hall between the intermediate buttresses is
supported by two cross-vaulted bays of the portico. At each end
are the domed chambers. The westernmost is supported by a
single cross-vaulted bay and the easternmost by the pre-
existing bay of the Almalikiyya portico supplemented by the
narrow rising vault over the entrance staircase. A simple cavetto
moulding running across the central compartment between
the intermediate buttresses distinguishes the upper facade (of
the assembly hall) from the portico below.

A stone pier abutting’? on the westernmost buttresses
appears to be all that remains of a portico built later to provide
access to the Subaybiyya (no. 51). This westward continuation
of the portico is alluded to by Mujir al-Din who states that the
porticoes under the Almalikiyya, the Is‘ardiyya and the
Subaybiyya were built at the same time as the madrasas above.’®

Aregular series of about a dozen empty sockets shaped to
receive the springers of a vaulted portico survives cut into the
face of the escarpment of Antonia (above, p. 44) at a height of
approximately 2.60m above the Haram esplanade. The average
span between the centres of the sockets is 3.89m. These sockets
certainly antecede the Mamlik portico which sustains the
Is‘ardiyya and the Almalikiyya, for they continue empty and
redundant in the rock face under these two buildings.

In describing the upper facade we shall treat each section
in the likely sequence of construction: assembly hall, eastern
domed chamber and western domed chamber. The 1927-28
restoration has introduced several changes at this level and
these will be itemized briefly, but it is the pre-restoration aspect
of the facade (plate 33.1) which merits detailed description.
(@) Assembly hall
The cantilevered mibradb salient — a unique form in the
architecture of Jerusalem — is the dominant feature of the
facade (plate 33.8). It is semicircular in plan, capped by a
ribbed semidome and resting on muqarnas corbelling.

The facade of the assembly hall is arranged symmetrically
about the miprab with four rectangular windows, two on each
side of the mibrab, set in shallow, muqarnas-headed recesses
with sloping sills. The two windows and their recesses adjacent
to the mibrab are considerably wider and taller than two lateral
windows and recesses. Originally the larger windows had
shallow relieving arches with joggled ablag voussoirs to
reduce the load on the lintels, while the load on the lintels of
the lateral windows was lessened by two relieving lintels with
undercut soffits. These original lintels have been replaced with
flat arches composed of ablaq voussoirs.

The curvilinear mugarnas corbelling of the window
recesses is original. The design of the corbelling is basically the
same in each case, but the slight extra depth of the two larger
recesses has permitted a more complete development of the
design to include pendent elements (‘stalactites’). At the lateral
recesses the base of the corbelling rests on moulded shoulders
(fig. 33.8) which reduce the effective span. This seems to
indicate that in the design of the muqarnas system a pattern
was used which did not quite match the width of the recess and
therefore necessitated the introduction of shoulders to adjust
the span to suit.
 Three oculi in the upper part of the wall ventilate the
assembly hall. The central oculus above the mihrdb is at a
somewhat higher level than the oculi over the lateral window
recesses and is encircled by ten radial ablaq voussoirs of
alternately red and cream-coloured stone. The oculi over the
lateral recesses are alike, encircled by six radial voussoirs of
plain cream-coloured limestone.

Originally a moulded cornice ran straight across the top of
the facade and onto the intermediate buttresses. The
rectangular pish-tdgq-like pediment above the central oculus
and the water spouts in the intermediate buttresses were added
during the 1927-28 restoration, as was the central dome, which
is much larger than the original small dome it encloses (cf.
plates 33.1 and 33.9).
 rial€ oo.! Maram tagaae berore restoration

(ti) Eastern domed chamber

The facade of this chamber was reconstructed during the
restoration and very little of the original remains. The
photograph taken by Creswell (plate 33.1) shows the original
Mamluk design, which consisted essentially of a double-arched
window surmounted by a central oculus and crowned by a
muqarnas canopy. The voussoirs of the window arches and of
the outer ring of the oculus were ablaq (presumably of red and
cream-coloured stone) as were the courses of masonry above
the arches. The inner ring of voussoirs around the oculus was
of plain limestone.

Originally the pointed arches of the double window
spanned from a central marble column with a Mamlik capital
and base (barely discernible in the pre-restoration
photograph) and lateral jambs of ashlar masonry. The left-hand
(western) jamb abutted on the buttress to the west in such a way
as to indicate that it was built later than that buttress. The
masonry courses of the right-hand (eastern) jamb are
 continuous and contemporaneous with the masonry of a
narrow buttress built hard against the western end of the
Almalikiyya. That buttress, carried by a simple rounded
console, was added at this eastern end of the upper facade to
support the muqarnas canopy which spans the recess.

Almost all of these details were altered in the
reconstruction. The double arch of the window now rests on
three columns with new capitals and bases. The design of the
facade above the window has been fundamentally altered to
reproduce that of the western domed chamber (described
below).

The mugqarnas canopy, of which almost half survived in
1914,” has been restored to its original form. The height of this
compartment of the facade is higher than the facade of the
assembly hall and matches that of the adjoining Almalikiyya.
The earlier low dome of the room behind, which is visible in
the photograph of Creswell, has been replaced by a much
larger and bulbous one on an octagonal drum duplicating the
likewise new dome of the assembly hall.

(iii) Western domed chamber

This echoes in its layout the original facade of the eastern
domed chamber, though the architectural details are more
elaborate. It was scarcely altered in the restoration. The pointed
arches of the double window rested on three re-used columns
with torus bases and stylized thick-leaf acanthus capitals of
undoubted Crusader manufacture. These Crusader capitals and
bases have been replaced with modern ‘Islamic’ muqarnas
capitals and bulbous bases; the column shafts may be
replacements as well. (The present whereabouts of the
Crusader capitals is unknown.) A stone shelf which projected
from the middle of the window sill (see plate 33.1) was
removed in the restoration.

As in the corresponding eastern compartment, the
voussoirs of the pointed window arches are ablagq, as is the
panel of ornament above, but here the extrados of the arches is
outlined by a moulding, which is identical in profile to the
mouldings which frame lintels of the Almalikiyya (fig. 10f) and
the double window arches of the Manjakiyya (no. 35). This
moulding extends upwards to frame the panel of ornament
comprising, in the central spandrel, a circular medallion of
ablag radial voussoirs around an inlaid disk, and, in each of the
side spandrels, a semicircular medallion of ablaq radial
voussoirs around a semicircular inlay. The moulding
surrounds the medallions and connects with the upper
transverse band through circular links in a fashion which
recalls the analogous feature on the facade of the Almalikiyya.

The three-tiered mugarnas canopy, unaltered in the
restoration, is fussy and more intricate than the canopy over the
eastern compartment of the facade, and also rises above the
height of the assembly hall. The slightly pointed dome seems to
be original; it sits on an octagonal drum. Originally the dome
 was probably cement-faced; the present stone cladding —
merely repointed in the restoration — appears to be Ottoman.

INTERIOR (plan, fig. 33.4)

(i) Entrance

The staircase leads up to an entrance door which is not original,
as Creswell’s photograph of the interior (plate 33.6) shows.
The present door takes the place of a flat niche decorated in
ablag with a pointed arch inlay in the form of a mibrab. The
location of the original entrance is not shown in Creswell’s
photograph nor is any trace of a blocked doorway discernible
now. But there are two clues which allow its position to be
established with a measure of certainty.

We know from al-‘Umar’’s text (p. 368 above) that the steps
leading up to the Almalikiyya also gave access to the Is‘ardiyya.
Inside, in the south wall of the tunnel-vaulted inner porch, the
present entrance door and the door leading into the assembly
hall occupy a shallow recess spanned by a continuous frieze of
muqarnas corbelling, which returns 1.65m northwards over a
plastered recess in the east wall of the porch but, significantly,
does not return along the west wall. The design is asymmetrical
and the reason is obvious: the recess in the east wall initially
housed the entrance doorway. Indeed, the two large fluted
niches in the upper register of the muqarnas frieze at the south
wall are directly above the door into the assembly hall and the
former mibrab’ while, in the east wall, a corresponding fluted

niche in the upper register surely marks the centre-line of the
original entrance doorway below.
 Se Re eR ee | ee ee ee eS Ne es NN teat ern rai,

the mibrab dismantled, a new straight-through entrance
doorway introduced,'* and the muqarnas corbelling above it
recut (plate 33.10). In the south wall of the porch, above the
muqarnas corbelling, is a rectangular limestone panel framed
by a band of red and cream-coloured stone. This panel,
originally uninscribed, now bears the restoration inscription
(above, p. 370).

(ti) Assembly hall (plate 33.5)

The right-hand door in the rear wall of the inner porch is the
sole entrance to the assembly hall overlooking the Haram. The
interior of the hall is vaulted in three bays separated by two
transverse arches resting on muqarnas imposts. The three
oculi in the south wall are positioned immediately under the
apexes of the vaults for maximum heat ventilation. The end
bays have plain cross vaults while the wider central bay has a
folded cross vault rising to an ornate cupola at the crown (plate
33.11). The octagonal base of the cupola is decorated with three
tiers of muqarnas supporting a ring of sixteen stalactites.

The south wall of the centre bay is unplastered, showing
the ablaq construction. The mibrab, semicircular in plan, is
placed in the centre of that wall within a shallow muqarnas-
headed recess (fig. 33.7, plate 33.12). The remaining walls and
the vaults are plastered. The main surfaces of the pre-
restoration plaster were defined by a small semicircular

moulding or baguette (visible in plate 33.5.) which was restored
in 1927-28.
 (iii) Eastern domed chamber

A simple rectangular doorway in the east wall of the assembly
hall leads directly into the eastern domed chamber. Here the
dome rests on a circular drum and double-faceted pendentives
(plate 33.13). The dome was rebuilt, at least externally, in the
1927-28 restorations (see above, p. 371).

(iv) Western domed chamber

A plain doorway in the west wall of the assembly hall opens into
the western domed chamber. This chamber has in addition to
the double window overlooking the Haram to the south
(described above, p. 371) a small rectangular window in its
west wall. Two arches at the north wall and one against the west
wall reduce the rectangular area to create a square basis for the
dome. Three-tiered muqarnas pendentives support the
octagonal drum, which has a double-arched squinch in each
corner and a double-arched flat niche in each of its four sides
(plate 33.14). The drum and the dome are plastered. The
mugqarnas pendentives appear to match the consistent style of
the muqarnas decoration found throughout the building and

{SE Pe Se oy tay TORE: hee y MET ter a —e

 this stylistic continuity implies a close chronological
correspondence between the western domed chamber and the
rest of the construction.

(v) Tomb

The inner porch opens directly on a tunnel-vaulted gibla iwan
(plate 33.6) at the south end of the open courtyard. A cross-
vaulted recess in the west wall of the zvdan houses an unmarked
cenotaph. The importance of this tomb recess is stressed by the
special decoration of its entrance (plate 33.4): a pointed
horseshoe arch composed of black and white ablaq voussoirs
springing from two re-used marble columns with unmatched
Crusader capitals (plates 33.16 and 33.17).

The lower part of the south wall of the recess, distinct from
the other walls, is unplastered and the masonry, to judge from
its size and tooling, is Herodian and i situ up to a height of
about two metres (plate 33.18). The stepped plan of the
upper masonry shows that here as elsewhere the Herodian wall
was articulated in a series of pilasters.”

The plain. marble-clad cenotanh ( pigte 33.19) is raised on
 a low marble plinth with a moulded base placed centrally
within the recess and oriented as usual east—west.

The opening under the arch of the tomb recess is screened
by a beautifully-made iron grille with a small grilled wicket gate
of two leaves in the centre. The original trefoil cresting and
Koranic inscription have become detached from the the grille,
though a short length visible #7 situ in 1920 (plate 33.4) still
survives (plate 33.20). Mamlik ironwork of this quality is
extremely rare and the grille deserves specialist study,
particularly since it is inscribed with what seems to be the
‘signature’ of the craftsman who produced it:

Muhammad b. al-Zayn, the servant of the humble servant
of the one in need of Allah, who hopes for the pardon of
his Lord, His Excellency (al-magarr)...

This inscription is incised on an iron strip (plate 33.21)
originally attached to the lintel bar on the wicket gate so that the
curved, downward projection would have been in the centre
where the two gate leaves meet. The strip is broken just beyond
the mid-point and the continuation of the inscription is lost.
The gate leaves themselves are marked at the corners with
curious symbols (plate 33.22), one on the vertical member
matching another on the adjoining horizontal member,
apparently intended to facilitate assembly of the gates on the
 site, away from their place of manufacture.
(vi) Courtyard (plate 33.2)
The irregular internal arrangement of cells around the
courtyard, evident in the plan (fig. 33.4), is not expressed
externally. The pointed-arched doors and windows are set out
quite regularly; only the elaboration of the well-niche (plate
33.3) in the west wall interrupts the rhythm of the scheme.
The door of the middle cell in the east wall, opposite the
well-niche, has recently been converted into a window when,
by the removal of an internal partition wall, that cell was united
with the adjoining south-eastern cell. The two pointed-arched
doorways at the eastern and western ends of the north wall
(plate 33.2) are set in shallow recesses each decorated with
three tiers of curvilinear muqarnas corbelling . The jambs of
the recesses are straight but the heads are chamfered, as are the
pointed arches of all the doors and windows around the
courtyard. The western door in the north wall has been
converted to a window and the internal arrangement of the cell
it served has been altered. A partition between it and the
adjoining cell to the east has been removed and a door in its
west wall is blocked (see plan). The small room that that
blocked door originally gave access to has instead been linked,
by the removal of its south wall, to the northern cell in the west
wall of the courtyard.
 With the exception of the two doorways at either end of
the north wall, the doors and windows around the courtyard at
this level are each surmounted by an eight-lobed oculus (plates
33.2 and 33.23). The upper walls on the west, north and east
sides of the courtyard project slightly, corbelled on a bed
moulding decorated with a repeating shallow muqarnas
element (see plate 33.23). Acyma recta cornice moulding runs
around all four sides of the courtyard.

(vit) Well-niche

The elaborate decoration of the well-niche is illustrated in plate
33.3. The chamfered trefoil which outlines the outer bay of
muqarnas vaulting is set within a recessed pointed arch. The
arch has two orders of decoration, the outer one an
interlocking trefoil pattern in relief such as occurs commonly at
Damascus,” and the inner one a chevron moulding which
reflects a local Crusader influence.” The impression created by
the composition is one of considerable imagination, as if the
mason in charge were practising his repertoire with
enthusiasm, and the muddling of the mouldings at the keystone
of the chevron arch shows that the work was to some extent
experimental.

The deep niche is vaulted in two bays which are separated
by a simple pointed arch (plate 33.24). The outer bay with its
 elaborate muqarnas vaulting contrasts with the simpler cross
vault of the inner bay, which is over the well-head. A chimney-
like orifice at the crown of the inner vault allowed water to be
drawn from the cistern to the cells above.

(viti) Staircase

The special decoration of the doorway at the eastern end of the
north wall of the courtyard (described above) could be
expected since that led to the upper floor. The similar
decoration of the door at the western end was probably
intended for symmetry. The eastern doorway opens into a
passage leading to a spiral staircase which rises under a well-
built ashlar vault to the upper floor (plate 33.25).

(ix) Upper floor (fig. 33.5)

At the top of the stairs the vaulting has been dismantled (plate
33.26); one now emerges in the open air beside a passage
connecting with two cells on the east side of the courtyard. The
door into the southern one has been walled up and the cell
annexed to the Almalikiyya (above, p. 316). The northern cell is
entered by a door in its south wall (the breach in its east wall is
modern). No other rooms survive at this level but the
disposition of the windows around the courtyard gives some
idea of the original layout. At the south side the ivén rises to
the full height of the two storeys. In each of the north, west and
east walls are three square windows with muqarnas-headed
slit windows above. To reduce the direct load on the lintels of
the square windows, the course of masonry immediately above
each is undercut to a cusped profile. Evidently there were three
cells entered from the north at the north end of the courtyard,
and possibly two cells on the west side arranged like those on
the east side with an access corridor. The cells at the north side
were ruined before 1920 and the breach in the north wall,
shown in plate 33.2, was repaired presumably during the 1927-
28 restoration. The cells on the west side were demolished to
make way for a new school built in 1923-24 (above, p. 207),
though their (blocked) windows remain.

18 This conversion to a ‘straight-through’ entrance was probably to facilitate the
entry of long planks of wood for scaffolding, etc. needed during the restoration.
After the restoration large bookcases had to be brought in (shown in Bayan al-
majlis al-shari al-islami al-a‘a fi Filastin, Jerusalem, 1924, on the photograph
facing p. 32). The double bend of the original entrance would have prevented the
introduction of inflexible objects more than two or three metres long.

19 Incised in the masonry of this wall were graffiti in Hebrew which tempted
Mayer (L.A. Mayer, ‘Hebraische Inschriften im Haram zu Jerusalem’, ZDPV, lviii,
1930, 229) to associate the Is‘ardiyya with the Zawiyat al-Lawi (‘the Zawiya of the
Levite’) mentioned by al-‘Umari. These inscriptions have since been effaced.
According to al-‘Umari’s description (cited above, p. 104) the Zawiyat al-Lawi
should be placed rather towards the Farisiyya Madrasa (above, p. 337).

","Situated over the south side of the bridge (discussed above, p.

(‘Tyropoeon’) valley, al-Wad, the building comprises a single
barrel-vaulted chamber entered from the street. To east and
west are vaulted shops and to the south are various adjoining
buildings that we have not surveyed.

The original structure appears to predate by more than a
century its endowment as a Koran School. It now houses a
stone cenotaph, presumably a later intrusion, marking the
grave of some unknown person.
 "
35,"Ill HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

Mujir al-Din states that this institution was situated ‘opposite
the Hadith College (Dar al-Hadith) ,' that is to say, on the south
side of the Chain Gate Street. According to Asali,’ it was just a
short distance to the east of the Khalidi Library. Late sijill
entries, quoted by him, show that access to the lower parts was
from the former Moroccans’ Quarter.

DATE
No date of construction is recorded. Only the date of the

drawing up of the endowment instrument is preserved, 20
Rabi‘ Il 761/10 March 1360.9

FOUNDER

As we owe the date above to Mujir al-Din, so we owe to him the
name of the source of the endowment, a Siraj al-Din ‘Umar b.
Abi Bakr Abi ’l-Qasim al-Sallami.* The identity of this person
has not been traced. There is the possibility that he was an

important merchant like the founder of the Sallamiyya Madrasa
(see p. 299).

ENDOWMENT

A list of properties is given in Defter no. 602,’ but without any
confirmation of the waqf date recorded by Mujir al-Din. The
institution is there described as ‘the ribat, known as the
Sallamiyya Koran School’. The eight rent-producing items
included a room within the ‘ribat’ and two shops at the door. All
the others were in Jerusalem (shops, gas, etc.), in Bab Hitta
(including a dye-works) or in the Bab al-‘Amid district. Only

one item (a room) had no recorded rent. The total for the rest
was 344 aspers.
 SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

As far as can be ascertained, there is no reference to the Koran
School in the Haram documents. The name of one early shaykh
is recorded by Mujir al-Din,° a Maliki scholar from North Africa
called ‘Abdallah b. Ibrahim al-Sikri (or al-Sukkari). In this
context Mujir al-Din calls the institution ‘the Sallamiyya School
of Koranic Textual Studies (Dar al-Qira’at al-Sallamiyya)’. It is
clear that this shaykh was perhaps more celebrated for his Sufi
‘sainthood’. He died around about the age of ninety on 2
Jumada II 829/11 April 1426.

No reference was found in the Jerusalem sijills which were
perused. However, Asali found two late pieces. One, dating
from the early eighteenth century, referred to appointments to
the headship and inspectorate of the ‘madrasa’.’ The other,
dated 1203/1788-89, records the surrender of these offices by a
member of the Imam family toa member of the Khalidi family,°
in whose hands the building has remained a family waqf until
the present.

LATER HISTORY

A document dated 6 November 1930 (in File 102/A6 Jerusalem)
in the archives of the Palestine Archaeological (Rockefeller)
Museum gives details of the later development of the site:

In 1266/1811 the upper two storeys were added by a
certain Daqaq. Between 1261/1846 and 1262/1847 it was
repaired by a certain Khalidi who bought the house from
Daqagq for a female relative (from hujjas written in 1227/
1812 and 1262/1847 respectively and in the possession of
Hajj Raghib Effendi al-Khalidi).
 "
35,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","STREET FRONTAGE ( plate 34.1)

The street frontage is quite plain. The main feature is an
archway which appears originally to have been the only
opening into the chamber. The archway is blocked with large
well-cut stones so as to leave only a small square window
opening in the centre. To the right of the archway a low door
has been opened in the original masonry, probably when the
archway was blocked. This doorway is now the only entrance to
the chamber.

A later stairway giving access to upper floors added in 1811
rises from east to west across the street frontage concealing
much of it from view. It was dismantled in 1983 allowing more
of the masonry to be examined ( plate 34.1). It has since been
 replaced by a modern stair. A small passage under the stair
maintains access to the entrance door.

The stonework of the street frontage appears to be
homogeneous except for the later masonry around the
entrance and blocking the archway (see plate 34.1). A kite-
shaped shield carved on the left-hand springer of the archway,
similar to others seen at the Bab al-Silsila, the Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-
Din and the Turba of Barka Khan (above, p. 115), suggests that
the archway was in existence by the early seventh/thirteenth
century.

 INTERIOR (plan, fig. 34.3; plate 34.2)

The entrance opens directly into the chamber, which is roofed
by a barrel vault spanning from east to west. A pointed arch of
well-cut ashlars spans a recess in the north wall next to the
street. This arch springs directly from the west wall and, at the
other end, from a respond occupying the north-east corner of
the chamber. It does not correspond to the (blocked) archway
in the street frontage, being greater both in span and height. In
the south wall is a smaller recess under a crudely-built
segmental arch, possibly a later modification. Some suggestion
of other changes in the structure is made by a break (shown as
a dotted line on the plan, fig. 34.3) running east-west across the
vault.

The chamber houses a stone cenotaph (1.98m long, 0.79m
wide, 1.05m high), presumably a later addition, projecting from
the east wall. Whose grave the cenotaph marks is not known. It
is possible that the window and door in the street frontage were
made when the grave was introduced in order to restrict access
to it. A clue as to when that might have been is given by a finely
carved octagonal post of marble at the west end of the cenotaph
(plate 34.2). This post appears to be in secondary use for it has
a slot cut into one side that serves no useful purpose in its
present position. Normally such posts marked the four corners
of Mamluk cenotaphs (p. 191), and the style and carving of this
one is typically Mamluk (fig. 34.4) but its solitary placement as
a headstone conforms to Ottoman funerary practice.” We may
therefore be justified in assuming that the grave is Ottoman.

The evolution of the site may thus be summarized:

(1) Structure in existence in the early seventh/thirteenth
century, possibly used as a shop, with an archway opening on
the street.

(2) Endowed by Siraj al-Din ‘Umar as a Koran School in 761/
1360 with no known architectural modifications.

(3) Used to house a grave in the Ottoman period when the
present cenotaph”? was built and, in all probability, the present
window and door in the the street frontage were inserted.

 "
36,"Il SITE AND BUILDINGS (fig. 35.2)
","The Manjakiyya stands partly on the roof of the northernmost
eight bays of the west portico and partly on the roofs of various
structures to the west, some of which may have been built at the
same time.

The portico from the south of Bab al-Nazir to near Bab al-
Ghawanima (i.e. the portico on which the Manjakiyya stands)
was built in 707/1307-8, according to Mujir al-Din.’ A beautiful
inscription on the face of the portico in front of Bab al-Nazir
(plate 35.1) confirms that ‘this portico . . . was built in. . . the
year 707°.” Yet al-‘Umari, writing about seventeen years before
the construction of the Manjakiyya, describes a garden planted
with trees and vines where now stand the nothernmost six bays
of the portico. According to his description, the portico
extended only one bay north of Bab al-Nazir.

Al-Umari’s description is substantiated by a distinct
change in the architecture of the portico between the first and
second bays north of the gate and between the second and third
 bays south of the gate. Thus the portico built in 707/1307-8
appears to have been asymmetrical about the gate, comprising
four bays only, two south of the gate, one at the gate itself, and
one north of the gate. The frontage of these four bays is
recessed 0.30m from the supporting piers. Each bay has a
simple cavetto moulding which runs across the top of the
recess. At the bay in front of the gate this moulding terminates
at each end with a pair of pendent mzuqarnas stalactites, and at
the other three bays it extends about 0.35m down each side of
the recess to little pendentive corbels (see plate 35.1).

The portico to the south was, as Mujir al-Din records,
added in 737/1336-37.° But when were the six bays to the north
added? It must have been after c.745/1345 (when al-‘Umari’s
description was written) but before c.762/1361 when the
Manjakiyya was built over them. The last two bays at the north
end of the portico are different from the others, being built
largely of re-used Crusader stones (many of which bear
masons’ marks) and lacking the impost mouldings found on
bays 3-6 and from 11 southwards. The absence of impost
mouldings may be explained by the fact that, as the ground
level of the Haram rises towards the north, the springing level
of the arches rises correspondingly and, rather than have
impost mouldings misaligned with those of the neighbouring
bays of the portico, the builders omitted them altogether.

The structures on the lower floor to the west of the Haram
wall are laid out according to no coherent plan and seem likely
to predate the main construction above. There is, however, no
way of telling when they were constructed, especially since the
building has been substantially remodelled (see below), and
so the possibility that part of this lower floor belongs to the
Manjakiyya cannot be ignored.

The building ‘had fallen into a sorry state’ by Mujir al-Din’s
time, and was later substantially remodelled in 1921-22. It is
now impossible to identify the original western limits of the
site. Old photographs (see plates 35.5-35.8) show, however,
that the original building followed roughly the lines of the
present one. Those parts of the building that occupy the roof of
the Haram portico, though slightly altered in the remodelling,
nevertheless retain largely their original form. These include a
domed loggia, overlooking the Haram through a fine double-
arched window, and a small prayer hall over the Haram gate.
The Haram facade is entirely unaltered except for the addition
of an unsightly council chamber above the south end in 1935.

Entrance was by way of a muqarnas portal on the north
Side of the street, Tariq Bab al-Nazir, which leads through a
vestibule into a staircase. Only the first (lower) section of the
 Staircase remains. A second, spiral staircase in the thickness of
the Haram wall led up from the portico to the loggia.
 "
36,"Il HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION oe
This madrasa was located by Mujir al-Din at the Bab al- Nazir, as
one of the institutions found on the west side of the Haram."" Its
identification has also been discussed by van Berchem,
although it is anepigraphic, and thus would not normally fall
within his scope.>

DATE

In the absence of a foundation inscription, there is some doubt
about when the madrasa was built and also when it was
endowed. Mujir al-Din wrote:
 AL-Manjakiyya

He [ie. Manjak] was ordered to reside in Jerusalem as
tarkban. He came to the city in Safar 761 [December 1359-
January 1360]. In a certain history [it is written that] ‘He
came to Jerusalem to build the madrasa for the Sultan al-
Malik al-Nasir Hasan’. It was his intention to build it for
him, but when the Sultan was killed in the year 762 [1361],
he built it for himself and it took his name. He endowed
the madrasa and provided it with students of law (fugaha’)
and other personnel.°

The ‘certain history’, which Mujir al-Din quotes, offers a
more circumstantial framework for the commencement of the
madrasa. The passage might be taken to mean that al-Nasir
Hasan initially planned the madrasa in Jerusalem, which is very
plausible in view of his many other foundations in his second
reign (755-62/1354-61), including madrasas in Hebron, Tripoli
and Aleppo, not to mention his magnificent madrasa in Cairo.
There is a slight problem. If Manjak was sent to take
responsibility for the Sultan’s madrasa, he cannot be said to
have chosen Jerusalem for his tarkban residence. Yet the
choice of place of residence was his. The Sultan’s order (tawq?)
is quoted by Ibn Khatib al-Nasiriyya from Ibn Habib’s history
under the year 761, including this sentence: ‘Thus it has been
ordered that the aforementioned should be tarkhan, residing
wherever he wishes’.’ The text quoted by Mujir al-Din does not
actually say that he was ordered to build by the Sultan. One
could understand that Manjak was acting on his own initiative,
planning to win the favour of the Sultan by building the
madrasa in the Sultan’s name.’

Mujir al-Din does not give a clear date for the
commencement or the completion of the Manjakiyya Madrasa.”
Nu‘aymi (d. 927/1521), who wrote later than Mujir al-Din,
places the construction of Manjak’s ‘khangah and madrasa’ in
Jerusalem during his period of residence there.!° But is this
based on any independent evidence? If one considers the date
of the endowment, which presupposes the completion of the
building, then there is again some lack of clarity. The two late
sixteenth-century land registers available provide conflicting
dates for the wagfiyya of Manjak. No. 522 gives 770/1368-69,!!
and no. 602 773/1371-72.'2 However, there is some sense in
accepting dates of about that period, since, as we shall see,
Manjak became governor of Damascus for the second time in
769/1368 and remained there for six years. If we accept that the
erection of the madrasa was begun, and even completed, in the
period 761-62/1360-61, Manjak’s immediate participation in the
revolt against Yalbugha and his subsequent five and half years’
imprisonment could have spelt the temporary eclipse of his
foundation, which would have needed re-endowment on his
return to power and affluence.""

FOUNDER
The founder, Sayf al-Din Manjak'* began as a mamlik of the
Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad. He is commonly given the nisha al-
Yusufi, but as far as is known, it is nowhere explained to whom
that refers. His career was a very chequered one, full of incident
and many changes of fortune. He appears in the chronicles in
the year 745/1344, when, as silahdar (swordbearer), he
brought the head of the deposed al-Nasir Ahmad from Kerak to
Cairo.'° In Rabi‘ II 745/August 1344 he was made an amir of
tablkhana rank'® and in the following year he was
commissioned to investigate the Amir Almalik in Safad and
then to bring him to Cairo (see p. 308). After the arrest of the
governor of Damascus, Yalbugha al-Yahyawi, it was again
Manjak who was dispatched to procure the rebel’s head
Qumada II 748/September 1347).'’ Perhaps as a reward for
these efforts, in Rajab 748/November 1347 Manjak was
promoted to be Amir of 100 and Chamberlain (Hajib) of
Damascus.'®

The second stage of his career begins after the accession of
al-Nasir Hasan and the appointment of his own brother,
Baybugha Rus, to be viceroy in Cairo. Manjak was brought to
court in Shawwal 748/January 1348 and given the posts of vizier

38S
 Mamtuk Jerusdiem

and major-domo.""? This period of power lasted nearly three
years with one slight interruption of forty days. He was one of
the ruling circle of amirs, which included his brother, the
viceroy, Shaykhi al-‘Umari and Taz (see p. 399). The balance
between the rivals in the oligarchy was very delicate. When
Baybugha and Taz went on pilgrimage in 751/1350, Sultan
Hasan asserted himself, urged on without a doubt by two amirs,
Manglibugha al-Fakhri and Mughultay. Manjak was arrested in
Shawwal/December of that year.” His first imprisonment in
Alexandria lasted about eight months.

After quite bewildering changes of alliance amongst the
amirs and a change of sultan —al-Salih Salih came to the throne
in Jumada II 752/August 1351 — Manjak was released’ and his
brother, Baybugha, freed from his confinement in Kerak, was
sent to be governor in Aleppo.” In a brief interlude Manjak
conspired with his brother but the plot was discovered; Manjak
was restored to his cell in Alexandria”? and Baybughi, having
failed in his revolt, was after a while put to death. This time
Manjak spent about twenty months in prison. As the amirs
continued to play their deadly game of factional politics, Manjak
was released through the influence of Shaykht and sent to
Safad as a battal (755/spring 1354).”*

There followed a particularly complicated period of his
life. Soon after the return of the Sultan al-Nasir Hasan, Manjak
was given the governorship of Tripoli in Dht’l-Qa‘da 755/
December 1354.” After the arrest of Taz, Manjak was
transferred to Aleppo in 759/1358,”° and after only a little while
moved to Damascus. He remained governor there until
Muharram 760/December 1358, when he was dismissed,
summoned to Cairo, but at Gaza fled into hiding.” Arrested
outside Damascus a little over a year later, he was pardoned by
Sultan Hasan, given an amirate of 40 and declared to be
tarkhdan, free to choose his place of residence.”*

In Cairo Sultan Hasan was overthrown in Jumada I 762/
March 1361. The regent of the new ruler, al-Manstr
Muhammad, was Yalbugha al-‘Umari. Manjak joined the revolt
of the then governor of Damascus, Baydamur, against him. Both
were seized by treachery outside Damascus (Ramadan 762/
August 1361), and once more Manjak found himself in prison at
Alexandria.” This time, the third, he stayed there for five anda
half years.

The political map again changed greatly in his absence. Al-
Mansi was deposed (Sha‘ban 764/May 1363) and succeeded
by al-Ashraf Sha‘ban, aged 10 years. Yalbugha, who continued
as regent, was killed by his mamliks in Rabi‘ II 768/December
1366.

Freed once more, Manjak began the last stage of his life
and nearly eight years of power and influence. In Muharram
769/September 1367 he was governor of Tripoli,*° before being
transferred to govern Damascus by Jumada I 769/January
1368.°' His last move was made in Dhii'l-Hijja 775/May 1374
when he made a magnificent entry into Cairo, there to be given
complete authority throughout the state.*? A little over a year

Manjak was praised for his public works: ‘He was . . . active
in promoting the welfare of the people and fond of buildings.
He acquired fine properties and selected beautiful old
buildings/monuments, and renovated (ammara) several
mosques, Sufi convents and hospices, and erected several
public caravanserais in Egypt and Syria, indeed throughout the
kingdom. He repaired bridges and roads’ 34 His own building
was extensive, and it is noteworthy that he directed the building
of a palace for Taz in Cairo in Muharram 753/February-March
1352.° He built a mosque Gami') in Cairo, which was
completed in 750/1349-50,°° a madrasa in Damascus, which is
described as Hanafite,*’ and a zawiya at Kiswa.>* In Defter no.
522 two Koran schools are mentioned, one in Jerusalem and
the other in Gaza, which were to have ten orphan pupils in each
and which were supported by the waqf income of a village in
Gaza district. The date of the endowment is given as 771/1369-
70,"" but in another defter as 749/1348-49.*° Again in Cairo, he
 had built a fine palace in the first stage of his career, that is,
before 748/1347-48,""' and, finally, a mausoleum near his
mosque, in which he was buried.”

ENDOWMENT

Both the Defters are in broad agreement on the details of the
endowment. It consisted of:

(i) The whole bath at Safad, formerly known as the Citadel
Bath* and now as the New Bath.

(ii) Three shops known as the Wakala (lit. caravanserai) at
Jerusalem.

(iii) 1 share (42) of the g@ a (hall) at the top of the Harafish Hill
in Jerusalem.

(iv) Rent (bikr) of a plot of land west of Jerusalem known by the
name of the waqif and as the Charity Land.

(v) 6 shares and a third and an eighth ofa share of the village of
Bayt Safafa in the Jerusalem district.

(vi) A parcel of land known as Manjak’s Land and Charity Land
in the Jerusalem district.

Item (vi) is only found in no. 522, as a separate entry. The
income of item (iv) is given in no. 522 as 1,513 aspers and in no.
602 as 1,510. As for item (i), the bath at Safad, register no. 522
has an entry“ which declares one fifth of its revenue to belong
to the Adhamiyya Zawiya at Jerusalem, which contradicts the
statement that it was wholly an endowment of the madrasa. It is
recorded that Manjak built the zawiya of the Adhamiyya Sifis
north of the old city and that he and other ‘pious people’
provided endowments for it. That the rights of the zawiya were
sometimes overlooked is demonstrated by a document in the
Jerusalem sijills® in which the administrator of the zawiya laid
claim to a fifth of the Bath’s income, had recourse to the terms
of Manjak’s waqf instrument, stating that ‘no more than two
thousand dirhams should be expended annually from the
income and rents of the said Bath’, declared that his
predecessor had agreed with the father of the present
administrator of the madrasa that the 2,000 dirhams of the
original wagf should be understood to be 2,000 aspers, and
then acknowledged receipt of the zawiya’s share for five years
(ending 983/1576), namely 40 gold pieces.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY
One of the three shops forming item (ii) is presumably the one
(called a béniit) ‘in David Street adjoining the Hardafish steps in
the southern row [of shops]’, the annual rent of which in 939-
40/1532-34 was 240 aspers. Of that sum 12 went to the waqf of
the Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-Din, no doubt because the shops purchased
by Manjak for his waqf were subject to a hikr rent for that earlier
foundation,* although it is not easy to identify the property in
the list of the holdings of the Ribat waqf (see pp. 117-119). In
Ramadan 947/May 1531 the ‘hall’ (gaa), described as being
‘below the madrasa connected with the portal (bawwdba)’, was
let for 200 aspers for a period of three years.”

No mention has been found in the Court registers of any
damage suffered by the madrasa in the major earthquake of
January 1546. Doubtless there was some. A ‘small room’
belonging to the madrasa and over part of the Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-
Din collapsed along with the vault below (see p. 119). In 959/
1552 29 paras were spent on clearing the drain of the madrasa
privy and in 961/1554 353 paras were paid out for the repair of
‘the residence on the roof (gasr al-sath) .®

One of the earliest, if not the first, of the heads (shaykhs)
of the Manjakiyya was Shams al-Din Muhammad b. ‘Abdallah b.
Sa‘d al-Dayri (c.750-827/1349-1424).? He was succeeded by his
son, Sa‘d al-Din Sa‘d (d. 867/1462-63).* By the sixteenth
century, a member of this same family, Sharaf al-Din Musa al-
Dayri, had become, to all appearances, the administrator of the
waqf of the madrasa in addition to the headship (mashyakba),
according to documents that cover the period 943-962/1536-
1555.”! The al-Dayri family were all Hanafis, which has led to
the assumption that that was the chosen school for the madrasa.
However, in two court documents dated 984 and 1018/1576
and 1608, the administrator is named as Zayn al-Din Ishaq b.
 ‘Umar b Abi ‘I-Lutf, who was Sh4fi7 mufti in Jerusalem.” In fact,
one of these documents makes it clear that Zayn al-Din was only
the deputy administrator — and this was doubtless true of the al-
Dayri family earlier — acting for a descendant of Manjak, the
Amir Muhammad Pasha. This latter had written to his deputy
that ‘it has come to my attention that the waqf of the madrasa is
ruined and that the entitled persons are not receiving their
stipends’. The deputy requested the Qadi to summon the
people concerned and to ask them whether they were
receiving their stipends annually or not. All, including the
mudarris, Abt ’| Fath b. Abi ’I-Lutf, the mz 7d, Salih al-Dayri, the
usual range of waqf officials and twenty-four readers of Koran
parts, return a contented positive answer. The fabric of the
madrasa is also attested to be in good order (amira). One
should recall that in 901/1496 Mujir al-Din had written: ‘In our
own time it has fallen into a sorry state. God alone gives
success!’

A note added to the entry of the Manjakiyya Madrasa in
Defter no. 522 reads: “The income surplus to the expenditure
on the madrasa belongs to the descendants of the founder.”
Probably Manjak also designated his direct descendants to
succeed himself as administrator in the terms of his waqfiyya.
If he acted similarly with all, or even some of, his other
endowments,” that might help to explain the continuity and
lasting importance of his family. They are easily traceable
through biographical dictionaries down to a third Manjak
(1007-1080/1598-1669), with whom the family fortunes began
to fade.® The father of this Manjak is the Muhammad (d. 1032/
1623) referred to above.*’ Of several persons it is expressly
stated that they administered the endowments of the family.

During van Berchem’s 1914 visit the Manjakiyya
functioned as a boys’ school. It later served as a private
dwelling’® until it was converted into offices for the
Department of Awqaf in 1342/1923, and such it remains until
Now.
 "
36,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","HARAM FAGADE (fig. 35.7, plate 35.2))

The facade of the Manjakiyya, set back 0.19m from the face of
the supporting portico, extends from the north end of the
portico southwards up to and including the bay in front of Bab
al-Nazir. A later (Ottoman) structure abuts on its south end. A
parapet and cornice moulding over the portico to the south
stop about 5m short of the facade. Originally it must have
continued northward. It was removed, presumably to provide
a firmer footing for the east wall of the Manjakiyya.

Acyma recta moulding defines the top of the facade, rising
in two places as a sort of rectangular pediment over the two
main features: the prayer hall over the portico at Bab al-Nazir
and the double-arched window of the loggia. Apart from the
loggia window the fenestration is relatively plain, consisting of
a somewhat irregularly spaced series of seven rectangular
windows of varying widths and heights. The soffits of the
 masonry course above each window are undercut to relieve the
load on the lintels. Five of the windows — two on each side of
the loggia window and one at the prayer hall — are surmounted
by smaller rectangular windows. Five spouts pierce the upper
part of the wall, under the cornice moulding, to drain rainwater
from the roof. They are logically placed above the blank
masonry between the windows.

The windows (and the floor) of the prayer hall are at a
higher level than the others since it lies above that bay of the
portico in front of Bab al-Nazir which has a dome, supported on
a splendid muqarnas transition zone (plates 35.3 and 35.4),
which rises higher than the cross vaults of the neighbouring
bays of the portico.
 The loggia window is composed of twin pointed arches
springing from three marble columns with re-used Crusader
capitals and bases on the side columns (p/ate 35.12). The
central column has a re-used base but its capital appears to be
a Mamlik copy of the other two (plate 35.13). Each of the
columns is decorated with an unusual carved band midway
between base and capital. The voussoirs of the arches are of
black and yellowish ablagq, as are the masonry courses above,
which contain two roundels of radial ablaq voussoirs. Each
roundel encloses a small central oculus (now filled with a disk
of some reddish substance but shown only roughly blocked in
van Berchem’s 1914 photograph”). A moulding outlines the
ablaq decoration above the arches and extends around the two
roundels. This moulding is similar in profile to the one framing
the lintels on the facade of the Amalikiyya (see p. 311 above).

ENTRANCE AND LOWER FLOORS (plan, fig. 35.4)
The building is now reached through a triple-arched portal on

Se Se ene ee 58 eee Na Bae ee a ed ne “DIN nn I Ridooie fone hi ate.
 35.21). This portal was erected at the time of the remodelling in
1340/1921-22, the date given in an inscription on glazed tiles
above the arches (plate 35.9). It leads into a grand entrance
staircase, built at the same time, which rises through some
earlier vaults to the upper floor (plate 35.11).

An anepigraphic Mamluk portal (plate 35.10) to the west
of the present entrance is almost certainly the original entrance
to the Manjakiyya. The architecture of this portal, notably
corner columns with simple mugarnas capitals and three-
tiered mugarnas corbelling supporting a smooth ashlar
semidome, suggests a mid-eighth/fourteenth-century date of
construction. The only building of that date listed in this vicinity
by Mujir al-Din is the Manjakiyya.

The entrance door opens into a vestibule (see plan, fig.
35.3), from which a door opens into a flight of thirteen steps
rising northward. At the top of this flight of steps a door opens
north into a labyrinthine complex of dimly-lit rooms
interconnected by a dog-leg passage. The rooms at the western
extremity of the complex, which overlook the courtyard of the
Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-Din, are mostly if not entirely Ottoman (see
above, p. 125), but the remainder must be earlier, for the
Manjakiyya stands partly on their vaults. Whether or not any of
them belong to the Manjakiyya itself is impossible to tell. None
the less, it is worth noting that toward the north end of this floor
the passage leads to an open courtyard (divided by modern
partitions) with an zwan opening on its south side (see fig.
35.4). To be sure, the structures on the west side of the
courtyard are Ottoman, but they may have been rebuilt, The
east wall of the courtyard is the Haram wall, in which Open a
door and a window. This courtyard and iwén are the only part
 of the structure that bear any resemblance to a ‘conventional’
Mamluk madrasa.

From this level a continuation of the stairway from the
vestibule would have led to the upper floor, but it no longer
survives. Its position is not known. There are several blocked
openings that might have led into such a continuation; perhaps
the most likely is one on the east side of a landing at the top of
the first flight of steps (see plan, fig. 35.4) since it would have
had the advantage of leading as directly as possible to the upper
floor.

Mujir al-Din lists the Manjakiyya as one of those buildings
that could be entered from inside as well as outide the Haram.
Access from within the Haram was by way of a stone spiral
staircase that led from the back of the portico.°! This staircase
must have risen from the second bay of the portico from the
north, where an excision in the vaulting may indicate the
position of its entrance, as shown dotted on the plan, fig. 35.4.
It is now inaccessible.

UPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 35.5)

The 1921-22 remodelling meant that ‘very little is left of the
original building. The inside . . . has been mostly gutted and
rebuilt’°! It is true that the bulk of the western part of the
building seems to have been reconstructed at that time, but
much of the eastern part above the portico and the southern
part overlooking the street appears to retain its original form.
The correlation between the fenestration and the plan of the
eastern range of rooms overlooking the Haram (marked “A-E
on the plan) indicates that they have undergone few alterations.
 The one noteworthy change concerns room ‘A’, which is
now roofed by a cross vault but was, as early photographs such
as plates 35.5 and 35.7 reveal, originally a yard open to the sky.
This may explain the presence of a spout protruding through
the Haram facade (see fig. 35.7) beside the north-east corner of
the room: it was there to drain rainwater from the floor of the
yard. Six steps against the south wall of that yard lead up to a
door into the prayer hall, which is roofed by a shallow dome on
much-replastered and somewhat amorphous pendentives. A
pointed-arched recess in the middle of the south wall contains
a plain mibrab (plate 35.14), which is surmounted by a
window.
 Al-Manjakiyya

A door in the west wall of room ‘A’ opens into a central
gallery around the modern entrance staircase. The gallery is
roofed by three cross vaults, the middle one rising to a lantern
at the crown. The octagonal base of the lantern is set contrary
to Mamluk custom with the sides, not points, coinciding with
the arrises of the vault (see plate 35.15 and fig. 35.5), which
Suggests that the vaulting is not original. Early photographs
confirm that the vaulting belongs to the later remodelling, for
they show that the roof of this area was once lower than the
roofs of the rooms to the east, not higher as it is now. The raised
walls supporting that new roof are pierced by clerestorey
windows, some of which have been blocked by the subsequent
addition of the council chamber. Doors in the east wall of the
gallery open into rooms ‘B’ and ‘C’, lit by windows overlooking
the Haram.

At the north end of the gallery are two archways (plate
35.16). The west one is blocked except for two windows, one
above the other, admitting light from the gallery to room ‘G’.
The upper window has a little fluted conch at its head. The east
archway leads into a long corridor, roofed by a series of cross
vaults, which comes to a dead end at the north wall of the
building. On the east side of the corridor a door opens into
room ‘C’ and two others open into ‘D’ and ‘E’. Between the
doors into rooms ‘C’ and ‘D’ an arched recess opens east into
the loggia. In front of that recess the series of cross vaults is
interrupted by a wider bay with a small octagonal oculus at the
crown, which appears to be part of the remodelling (plate
35.17). The spiral staircase from the portico may have emerged
hereabouts, but there is no trace of it now.

The loggia enjoys a magnificent view of the Haram
through its double window. The dome over the loggia is
supported by a twelve-sided drum on double-faceted
pendentives which taper down to bevelled points in the
corners (plate 35.18). Pointed-arched windows open in each
side of the drum and, between them, little pendentives
outlined by a plaster bead moulding complete the transition to
the circular base of the dome (plate 35.18). Two doors open
north and south from the loggia into the adjoining rooms.
Neither has reveals and they seem to be later insertions, though
the barrel vault of room ‘D’ has a small excision above the door
into it, which may indicate that that door is original.

Beyond the entrance to the loggia the corridor is lit by
three segmental-arched windows in its west wall. These
windows appear modern, perhaps replacing earlier windows.
At the north end of the corridor another modern window
opens on the Haram. Originally there was a staircase at this end
of the corridor, which led up to the roof. It was lit by a window
in the north wall of the building and had a doorway at its head,
both visible in early photographs (see plates 35.5 and 35.7), but
they no longer exist.

Doors in the west wall of the corridor opposite those into
the loggia and room ‘C’ give access to rooms ‘F and ‘G’, both of
which have modern vaults and appear to belong to the 1920s
remodelling. Between these two rooms a barrel-vaulted
passageway runs west, with doors opening north and south
from it into these rooms, before turning south to run along the
west boundary of the building. The passageway is lit by six
possibly modern windows in the west boundary wall. Windows
in the east wall of the passageway admit borrowed light to
rooms ‘G-I’, all of which appear to be part of the remodelling.
Toward the south end of the corridor a door opens west into
room ‘J’, which houses modern latrines.

At its south end the corridor opens into a tall chamber
(marked ‘stairwell’ on the plan), which contains a modern
flight of reinforced concrete stairs that give access to the
council chamber (p/ate 35.19). The barrel vault of the stairwell
appears to be modern. A shallow-domed room (K) to the west
of the stairwell is also a later addition, as may be inferred from
a vertical joint in the exterior masonry between it and a small
zwan-like chamber (L) which opens on the south side of the
stairwell. This chamber sits above the entrance portal and
appears to belong to the original foundation.
 Also part of the original foundation is a cross-vaulted hall
(M) which sits on the earlier vault of the outer porch at Bab al-
Nazir. The date of that porch is not known but its semicircular
frontal arch (see plate 35.20) would tend to indicate a pre-
Crusader construction. The Ayyabid wall of the Wafa’iyya (no.
44) on the south side of the street abuts against the porch and
is clearly posterior. Hall ‘M’ is entered from the south end of the
gallery (see plate 35.15). A group of three windows in its west
wall gives a splendid view over the city (plate 35.22). The larger
central window is surmounted by a slit, and has a little stone
balcony supported by two roll corbels projecting from its sill
(see plate 35.23). These windows are arranged to be as nearly
as possible in the centre of the west wall of the hall, which
means they are not centred on the earlier porch below.

INTERPRETATION
Although little can be deduced with confidence from the layout
 of the building owing to the major remodelling done in the
1920s, it seems possible that the founder, Manjak al-Yasuff,
intended the building to include residential quarters for his
own use during his term as tarkbdn in Jerusalem. As noted
above, there is little in the present layout that is typical of a
conventional Mamluk madrasa, which is the term Mujir al-Din
uses to describe it. Not enough is known about the residences
of Mamlik amirs to say what was typical, in Jerusalem at least,
but certain features like the small prayer hall and the domed
loggia with its fine view and its associated staircase connecting
it with the Haram, seem appropriate to such a residence. The
possibility cannot be ruled out that a madrasa was located on
the lower floor—where there is an open courtyard and an zwan
—and that the upper floor initially served as Manjak’s temporary
residence. The mention of a ‘residence on the roof in a tenth/
sixteenth-century Ottoman document (see above, p. 386)
might recall that original arrangement.

37,"Il SITE AND BUILDINGS (fig. 36.2)
","The unusual L-shaped plan suggests that earlier structures
defined the site boundaries. The street forms the southern
boundary, of course, and there the lowest three masonry
courses on the facade, deeper than the courses above, may be
remains of some earlier construction. The Kilaniyya forms the
western boundary, and a pre-existing structure to the east, of
which only a narrow masonry upstand now survives
(supporting the east end of the upper floor of the Taziyya),
defines the eastern boundary. The full extent of early structures
that may once have occupied the site is, however, hard to tell.
Several of the interior vaults seem to predate the foundation of
the Taziyya. One stone bears a Crusader mason’s mark,
indicating that it cannot be earlier than the sixth/twelfth
century.

An entrance vestibule, a staircase, and two cross-vaulted
chambers, ‘A’ and ‘B’, occupy the southern part of the site. A
passageway along the west side of these two chambers leads
north from the vestibule to two contiguous vaulted halls, ‘C’
and ‘D’, aligned at right-angles to each other. Both these
northern halls appear to belong to some earlier construction.
The western (D) extends along the north side of the Kilaniyya
(above, p. 332). The northern boundary of the site appears to
coincide with the line of a bridge spanning from west to east
across the town’s central valley (see above, p. 184).

Taz added an extensive upper storey which includes an
iwan (now blocked) leading to a large cross-vaulted main hall
overlooking the street to the south. Various living quarters to
the north, mostly now rebuilt, include a large domically-
vaulted room and a small bath-house.
 "
37,"Iii HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION ae
The building is thus described by Mujir al-Din:

The Taziyya Madrasa in David Street near the Gate of the
Chain is an endowed foundation of the Amir Taz, who died
in the year 763 [1362].

A surviving inscription, published by van Berchem,” identifies
the ‘mausoleum’ (turba). Further evidence will be given to
show that teaching activities were associated with the site to
justify the appellation ‘madrasa’. The funerary inscription is as
follows:

Tr the name alCadthe Mercifal the Compassionate. Luis
 is the mausoleum of the servant of God Almighty, his most
noble Excellency, Sayf al-Din Taz. He died (may God have
mercy on him) in the year seven hundred and sixty-three
{1362].

DATE

Soon after Jumada I 762/March 1361 Taz was allowed to reside
in Jerusalem in retirement. Perhaps the construction of the
Taziyya was begun in that year. That most evidence points to his
having been buried in Damascus may mean that the
mausoleum was not finished by his death, but there is no firm
evidence for building dates, nor for the date of the endowment
(see next section for references).

FOUNDER

Taz was a mamlik of the Sultan al-Malik al-Nasir Muhammad,
but too young to play a prominent role in that reign. He served
in the corps of pages as a cupbearer, which function provided
him with his arms (a cup). They appear in two cartouches on
the above inscription. In 742/1341-42 he was fortunate not to
lose his life after an unsuccessful revolt by a small number ofal-
Nasir’s mamliks against the Amir Qawsiin.?

He had reached the top amiral rank by 748/1347-48* and
took a place in the highest councils of state, as one of the six
ruling amirs in the reign of al-Muzaffar Hajji.’ This leading
position continued through the first reign of al-Nasir Hasan and
the reign of al-Salih Salih, the years 748-755/1348-1354.
Towards the end of this period Taz embarked on the
construction of a fine residence in Cairo, initially with the Amir
Manjak in charge (see p. 386), which was completed in Jumada
11 754/uly 1353.°

On Sultan Hasan’s return to the throne he was removed
from the centre of power to the post of governor of Aleppo
(Shawwal 755/October 1354).’ Early in 759/1358 he was
arrested and imprisoned in Alexandria, where he was blinded.®
When Sultan Hasan had been overthrown (Jumada 1 762/March
1361), Taz was released and his request to be allowed to reside
in Jerusalem was granted. He was given a tablkhana amirate for
his support. Nineteen months later he was dead (22 Dhi'l-Hijja
763/10 October 1362).” It was in Damascus that he died, since
he had been transferred to that city with tarkban status at the
end of 762/1361.'° His remains were not carried to Jerusalem to
be laid to rest in his mausoleum. ‘Abd al-Rahmaan b. al-Husayn
al-‘Iraqi, whose father enjoyed a ‘firm friendship’ with Taz,
records that the amir was buried in the Cemetery of the Sifis in
Damascus.""
 Various members of Taz’s family are known from the
chronicles. His father, Qutghaj, came to Egypt in 752/1351 from
‘the lands of the Turks’ and became a Muslim. He set out for
home to bring the rest of the family but died at Ma‘arat al-
Nu‘man. His body, and that of a brother of Taz called Jarkas,
were eventually brought to Cairo in 754/1353 and buried in a
turba outside Bab al-Mahriq. Taz instituted Koran reciters at
the mausoleum and other offices supported by endowments, as
he was to do for his own intended last resting-place.!? A
brother, Jantimur, who had been a great favourite of al-Salih
Salih, outlived Taz and was executed as a supporter of Sultan
Barquq’s rival, Mintash, in 793/1391.'° A son, Abii Bakr (see
below), mentioned as an amir in 778/1376-77, held six villages
in Egypt according to information which goes back to registers
of the reign of al-Ashraf Sha‘ban.'* This sultan took as wife a
daughter of Taz, who died in 771/1369-70.” Taz himself had
married two daughters of al-Nasir Muhammad. The first died in
750/1349-50, and in 752/1351 he married the Lady Zahra’.'* It is
interesting to note that a freedwoman of Taz settled in
Jerusalem and married a cotton merchant.'”

ENDOWMENT

The Amir Taz concentrated the endowments he provided for
his Jerusalem foundation in the village of Minya (or Mina),
situated on the north-west shore of the Sea of Galilee. We read
in the Defter no. 602 as follows:""®

The waqdf of the Taziyya Madrasa in the Bab al-Silsila:

(i) the village of Minya’? in Safad district — complete.
Income... [blank].

(ii) a shop together with the baker’s oven in the said village
— complete.

(iii) a mill (taht) in the said village — complete.

No date is given for the waqfiyya.

MAMLUK PERIOD

The Haram documents contain several pieces which concern
the Taziyya, which is in all of them called ‘the mausoleum
(turba) of his late Excellency Sayf al-Din Taz’, except in one
case (see no. 595 discussed below). Six documents contain
appointments (phrased like administrative decrees, marsiims)
made by the nazir of the waqf, an Amir Sayf al-Din, whose
identity might have remained a mystery, were it not that no. 7
(verso) had a cursive note which we read as ‘Written by Aba
Bakr b. Taz’? This suggests that Taz according to common
practice had nominated his own family to be the overseers of
his endowment.

All these appointments, Or re-appointments, are of a
certain Burhan al-Din Ibrahim al-Nasiri, whose other affairs,
both before and after his death, feature prominently in the
Haram documents:
 On the recto of no. 310 is Burhan al-Din’s petition for the
post, in which he urges that he is ‘poor and a family man, a
“bearer” of the Book of God and a student of religious
learning’. Indeed, he claimed elsewhere” that he had been
studying Tradition for six years without a stipend. In the
petition on the recto of no. 7 he asks to be allowed to keep the
appointments he holds (al-taqdrir), namely reciting at the
founder's catafalque (al-qird’a ‘ala’l-darih), the post of fagih
and the reciting of the ‘tenth’.

One may readily imagine a similar document being issued
to Shams al-Din Muhammad b. Hamid b. Ahmad al-Ansari al-
Shafi'T (732-782/1331-1381), who ‘held the post of mudarris in
the Taziyya Madrasa.’*? A member of the Qalgashandi family,
Sharaf al-Din ‘Abd al-Rahman (769-820/1368-1418) is another
person known to have taught law in the Taziyya.”* These two
cases, plus that of Burhan al-Din who was faqih (student of
law), are early evidence for that wider role of the Taziyya
referred to above. A Sifi of the Bistamiyya order, Shams al-Din
‘Isa al-Shafi‘i (d. 875/1471) ‘taught the Koran to children at the
Taziyya Madrasa’. Other evidence will confirm that the
complex included a Koran school. From the madbbhab
affiliation of these appointees one may assume that Taz made
his foundation with the Shafi‘is in mind.

An interesting list of effects left to the Taziyya Madrasa as an
endowment is contained in Haram document no. 595, dated
mid-Safar 781/2 June 1379. The objects were received by the
bawwab, the Shaykh Musa b. Sulayman, after the death of the
waqif, a Shaykh ‘Abd al-Wahid. The inventory includes two
complete boxed Koran sets, nine bound volumes of religious
works, twenty-seven lamps (one gilded, four ‘with brass heads’,
the rest painted), various hangings and curtains, amongst them
three tomb coverings, blue, white and black, and eleven
carpets.”°

OTTOMAN PERIOD
In what follows details are given from a series of accounts of the
application of the waqf income taken from the Jerusalem sijills.
It is important to underline the appearance of payments to
orphans in the Koran school and for students of law, and also to
stress the sums expended or earmarked for repairs both of the
Taziyya itself and of its revenue-producing properties. It may be
rash to say so, but there is every sign that the waqf was managed
efficiently. The surplus for 944/1537-38, see para. (i) below, is
marked ‘to be allocated to the peasants of Minya’. That sum, like
the one thousand paras of the 979-80/1571-73 account, see (v),
was a loan to the peasants, called quvwa (lit: power, support).””

 "
37,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","STREET FACADE (figs. 36.5 and 36.10; plate 36.1)
The facade is bounded by the Kilaniyya to the left (west) and by
the narrow upstand of rough stonework, evidently all that
remains of some earlier building, to the right. A later shop
further to the east abuts on this masonry upstand.
Notwithstanding Taz’s illustriousness, the facade of his
foundation is unusually modest. The entrance is a simple
undecorated doorway quite different from the grand entrances
to the pious foundations erected by his peers. The only
elaborate decoration is concentrated around an iron-grilled
window which occupies a large part of the lower facade.
Enclosed by a quirked ogee frame moulding, the window is
constructed in red and cream-coloured ablaq masonry. A
monolithic lintel bears the dedicatory inscription and flanking
blazons. Above the lintel a course of ablag revetment Is
designed to resemble a flat relieving arch with trefoil joggling
to interlock its five pseudo-voussoirs. The masonry coursing of
 the window does not coincide with that of the rest of the facade,
giving the impression that the window has been inserted into
an existing wall.

A cavetto moulding runs across the ground floor facade,
separating it from the upper floor. The cavetto has moulded
stops at either end; the left-hand stop abuts on the Kilaniyya and
the right-hand stop abuts on the masonry upstand that supports
the east end of the upper floor where it oversails the ground
floor facade by 0.59m.

Immediately above the lintel of the entrance door and
centred a little to the right of it there is a strange opening
blocked with a coursed rubble infill. The semicircular head of
the opening is not an arch — there are no voussoirs — and it is
supported now only by the infill wall; when open there must
have been some other means of support, possibly a timber
frame. The opening has been pierced through the masonry of
the facade presumably in Ottoman times since a stone,
apparently in re-use, in its left jamb bears traces of a lightly-
carved fretwork pattern typical of Ottoman work. Two blocked
sockets, one on each side of the opening, suggest some sort of
cantilevered support, possibly for a timber mashrabiyya oriel
window like those projecting from many neighbouring
buildings (plate 29.1). Small cavities cut in the masonry above
and on each side of the opening would have helped to secure
such a structure, while four small sockets in the second course
of masonry above street level might have retained some
supporting framework. Traces of plaster around the opening
are further signs that this part of the facade was enclosed at
one time.

The masonry of the upper facade is quite homogeneous,
evidently all Mamlik work (plate 36.2). The fenestration is
symmetrical about the central axis. The main feature is a large
pointed-arched opening concealed by a timber oriel window
of typical nineteenth-century Ottoman construction.
Presumably it replaces an earlier Mamlak mashrabiyya
window of which no trace survives. It is flanked by a small
grilled window on either side, each with an undercut slit in the
stone course above its lintel. Above the arched opening are
three plain windows, the central one now blocked. A cavetto
moulding with downturned finials at each end runs across the
top of the facade; the carving of this moulding is much rougher
than that of the lower cavetto, possibly because it is less clearly
visible from the street.

VESTIBULE (plan, fig. 36.3)

The entrance door opens into a low vestibule from which
doors in each side and in front (plate 36.3) lead to the three
component parts of the building; two cross-vaulted chambers
(A and B) to the west; a passageway to two vaulted halls (C and
D) to the north; and a staircase on the east side leading to the
upper floor. The present form of the vestibule is not original

CS Tl  — SC ee wt [marae Sao es
 and the various alterations to it are discussed below.
 FRONT CHAMBERS ‘A’ AND 8B’

The floors of these two chambers are raised 0.93m above the
floor of the vestibule, requiring four steps from the vestibule
up to the first chamber (A). These steps reduce the clearance
under the doorhead to 1.75m — too low for easy passsage — and
it seems likely that the floor level of the chambers was
originally much closer to that of the vestibule (see below, p.
408).

The dedicatory inscription on the window lintel leads one
to suppose that chamber ‘A’ contains the grave of the founder,
though there is no other sign of it. The ceiling is and must
always have been cross-vaulted, not domed as was usual for
Mamluk tombs.

A pointed-arched opening placed off centre in the north
wall of chamber ‘A’ leads to the second cross-vaulted chamber,
‘B’. A pointed wall arch 0.61m deep occupying the full length of
the west side of chamber ‘B’ accounts for the asymmetrical
placement of that opening. A rectangular window in the north
wall of the chamber opens into the first of the northern halls
(C). This window is partly blocked by an arched recess ina later
wall built against that end of the chamber; the purpose of the
secondary wall is not apparent.

NORTHERN HALLS ‘C’ AND ‘D’

From the entrance vestibule a plain door (plate 363) opens
into an unlit passageway (plate 36.4) which runs alongside
chamber ‘B’, described above, to give access to the two
northern halls. A late Ottoman inscription built into the east
wall of the passage was first recorded in 1865 by Sandreczki in
the Harat al-Sharaf, about 100m north-west of the Taziyya.”8 In
1914 van Berchem” saw the same inscription in the same place
as Sandreczki (near where we subsequently found a Mamluk
epitaph”). Its presence now in the Taziyya testifies to building
work there at some time after 1914 when for unknown reasons
it was transferred. A blocked opening beside the inscription in
the east wall of the passage, under a cross-vaulted bay, may
originally have been a window that was put out of commission
by the later construction of adjoining buildings. The present
occupant, Mr Abdullah Dajani, says that his wife’s grandfather
made several alterations to the property about seventy years
ago.

At its north end the passage opens into large hall ‘C’, the
floor of which is covered with rubbish. It is cross-vaulted at its
southern end and barrel-vaulted to the north where a later vault
(plate 36.5) has been inserted to provide an entresol. Access to
this later entresol is by means of a staircase from the upper
storey cut in the thickness of the eastern boundary wall (fig.
36.4).
 Various openings pierce all four walls of hall ‘C’. Beside
the exit from the passage in the south wall is the window into
chamber ‘B’ described above. A recess above that window
serves no obvious purpose. Four openings in the east wall are
arranged in pairs, one above the other (plate 36.6). The pointed
arches in undisturbed masonry of the two southern openings
(the lower of which is blocked) suggest that they belong to the
original construction. Of the two northern openings, the lower
one with its well-built jambs also appears to be original, though
its head has been dismantled and replaced by a relieving arch
built in the outer face of the wall at some later date (plate 36.6).
The window above it appears to be a later insertion, possibly to
light the entresol. In the north wall a small window opens
under the crown of the vault. In the west wall there is a wall
arch, now blocked up (plate 36.7), and, to the north of it and
partly blocked by the entresol, two openings into the western
hall. Both openings are formed in well-built ashlars, one of
which bears the mason’s mark referred to above. The left-hand
(southern) opening has a flat lintel, the right-hand one a slightly
 pointed arch (plate 36.8).

Apart from these two openings, the western hall, ‘D’, has
no other doors or windows, only five arched recesses (two in
the south wall, two in the west wall (plate 36.9), and one in the
north wall). If these recesses once contained openings there is
no trace of them now except in the north wall recess where the
lintel of a blocked door or window is identifiable; the lower
part of all the walls is concealed by an accumulation of rubbish
on the floor.

The east and north external walls of halls ‘C’ and ‘D’ display
at ground floor level a general uniformity of construction. The
masonry of the east wall is interrupted by what seem to be
secondary — structural modifications including two
superimposed semicircular arches (plate 36.6) apparently
introduced to reinforce the wall and, immediately to the north
of them, a tall sloping-topped buttress with the same function.
The same masonry returns to form the north boundary wall,
now largely obscured by accumulated debris.
 UPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 36.4)
In the north-east corner of the entrance vestibule (plate 36.3)
four steps lead east up to a small landing from which a further
six steps rise north to another landing with a door to the south
leading over a high step to a small mezzanine chamber over the
vestibule (section, fig. 36.9). This mezzanine appears to be a
later intrusion formed by the construction of a new floor
spanning across the vestibule (which originally rose
unobstructed to the full height of the present mezzanine
ceiling). The piercing of the round-headed opening visible in
the facade (above, p. 403) must have been done at the same
time. An original recess in the east wall of the vestibule was
presumably blocked then too; it seems originally to have
housed the lower steps of the staircase to the upper floor,
replaced by the four steps which now protrude into the
vestibule.

From the landing beside the mezzanine the staircase
(plate 36.10) continues up to a landing where one door Opens
west into a barrel-vaulted ivan and another Opens north into a

courtyard. All the upper floor rooms are reached from the
courtyard.
 To the south is the zvdin, its pointed-arched opening now
blocked up save for three new windows (plate 36.11). A door
in the south-east corner of the ian gives access to a stair that
originally led up to the roof; the opening on to the roof is now
blocked. A timber floor (see plate 36.12) has been inserted
across the iwdan at some time to provide an extra room in the
vault space (section, fig. 36.6). This new room is reached by way
of a later external stairway that runs against the wall blocking
the iwan (plate 36.11) before turning into a corridor alongside
the iwén’s west wall. This corridor occupies the site of a
presumed gallery that originally belonged to the Kilaniyya
(above, p. 335).

A door flanked by two windows (the west one now
blocked) in the rear wall of the ivan (plate 36.13) opens into
a large cross-vaulted hall. The principal feature of this main hall
is a tall pointed-arched opening into the timber oriel window
that protrudes from the street facade (above, p. 403). Low
windows flank the arched opening (plate 36.14) and three
smaller windows (the central one now blocked) surmount it.
Arched recesses fill the west and east walls of the hall; a small
window opens under the crown of the eastern recess.
 The other rooms on the upper floor are arranged round
the north, west and east sides of the courtyard. Almost all of
them appear to be Ottoman or later. The paving of the
courtyard appears, however, to be original though its former
extent is not known; the later buildings have given it a Z-shape
in plan.

At the south-east corner traces of a springing course in the
masonry above the door of the main staircase seem to indicate
that there was once some sort of porch there. Nothing else
survives of it. A well-head about 2m north of the door would
 have been sheltered by such a porch. The present well-head is
modern but it probably replaces an earlier one. It connects
with a cistern beneath the ground floor by way of a masonry
shaft built out from the east wall of hall ‘C’ on the ground floor.

At the south-west corner the stairs up to the later room in
the vault of the zvdn described above separate the western
abutment of the zwan from two small chambers (plate 36.15),
the southern one cross-vaulted and oriented north-south, the
northern one oriented east-west. Both are later additions, as
obviously are the three privies on the east side of the courtyard.
To the north of the privies is the entrance to the stairs down to
the entresol (above, p. 403) and, in the north-east corner of the
courtyard, a modern room built during the present tenant’s
lifetime.

To the west of that modern room stand the remains of a
ruined vault (plate 36.16), evidently structurally homogeneous
with a large domically-vaulted room beyond, which is entered
through a plain doorway under the ruined vault. At the north
end of this room a barrel-vaulted recess, spanning the full
width of the room, leads up one step to the main domically-
vaulted area to the south. The domical vault is supported by
pointed wall arches on three sides and the barrel vault of the
recess on the north side, a typical Ottoman construction
technique. The decoration too is typically Ottoman: paired
windows with complex ogee heads surmounted by a central
oculus, a very elaborately carved stone sideboard (plate 36.17)
opposite the entrance door, and ornamental plasterwork on
the dome (plate 36.18) in a style that can be dated to the
eighteenth century.*!

BATH-HOUSE

A small door in the north wall of the domically-vaulted room
leads into an exquisite private bath-house comprising small
interconnected chambers with perforated domes (plates
36.19-36.24) which are very similar in design and execution to
the domes of Mamluk bath-houses. It may be that this private
bath is a Mamlik construction retained during the Ottoman
rebuilding, but the possibility that it is Ottoman cannot be ruled
out.

PURPOSE OF THE BUILDING

The layout of the Taziyya is quite unusual. The inclusion of
earlier structures within the complex, and subsequent
alterations to it, do not conceal the fact that it has few of the
usual features of a tomb or of a madrasa. Even the zwdan on the
upper floor is untypical, serving rather as an antechamber to
the main hall. While it is impossible now to assign a specific
purpose to each room or group of rooms, the general
arrangement is that of a somewhat grand residence. The
presence of a small bath-house on the upper floor tends to
confirm this impression.

How, then, is the dedicatory inscription on the street
facade to be explained? That inscription states that this is the
funerary complex (turba) of Sayf al-Din Taz who died in 763/
1362. It must, therefore, have been cut after his death. On the
one hand there is some agreement in historical sources that Taz
was buried in Damascus and, in any case, if the present building
was built to include a tomb for Taz we should expect to finda
domed chamber for the tomb. There is none. Yet on the other
hand the present tenant claims that there is one grave under the
first of the ground floor chambers (A), next to the street, and
three under the second (B). The raised floor of these two
chambers suggests that some sort of grave markers or
cenotaphs might have been left intact under a new floor which
was laid at some time when the building was remodelled for
commercial or domestic use. The bequeathal of three tomb
coverings in 781/1379 (above, p. 401) may also indicate the
presence of one or more graves at that time.

However, whether or not burials were made in the
building, it seems reasonably clear that it was not designed with
ae purpose in mind. A likely sequence of events may be listed
thus:
 (1) Taz retires to Jerusalem in Jumada I 762/March 1361 and
acquires the site — already partly or wholly occupied by existing
structures — for his new residence.

(2) He endows it as a madrasa with members of his family
nominated as overseers of the endowment.

(3) At the end of 762/1361 he is transferred to Damascus where

the reference to the ruling Sultan in the title of the 7dzir, the al-malaki al-fulani

 "
38,"Ill HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

Mujir al-Din records that ‘the Ribat al-Maridini faces the
Kamiliyya in Bab Hitta [Street]. It is in the vicinity of the
Awhadiyya Turba.’' The Kamiliyya no longer survives but it is
known to have been to the north of the Karimiyya on the east
side of the street. The Awhadiyya is on the west side of the
street, beside the Haram gate (above, p. 167), and a sijill entry
of 947/1540 makes the Maridaniyya Madrasa (sic) the north

boundary of a gaa, the south boundary of which is the
Awhadiyya.”

FOUNDERS

The founders are said by Mujir al-Din to have been two
unnamed freedwomen of the Artugid ruler of Mardin in the
Jazira, al-Salih b. Ghazi II (ruled 712-65/1312-63).

DATE

Mujir al-Din saw a document dated 763/1361-62 which ‘proved’
the waqf. He adds that a condition of the waqf was that the
institution should serve visitors from Mardin. As it happens,
Haram document no. 173, dated 795/1392, records the death of

a pilgrim from Mardin, Bulghar bint ‘Abdallah, in what is there
called the Maridaniyya Madrasa,
 "
38,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","STREET FRONTAGES ( plates 37.1-37.3)
The masonry of the street frontages — on Tariq Bab Hitta to the
 east and Tariq al-Mujahidin to the north — is not uniform. The
lower courses appear to belong to some earlier structure of
unknown date, the ruins of which served as the basis for the
present building. The upper courses are of smaller stones
above that earlier masonry. These incorporate at the east end of
the north frontage the springing of an arch that once spanned
the street (see plates 4.1 and 4.2). The upper storeys are later,
almost certainly Ottoman additions.

The fenestration is quite plain, consisting of one
rectangular window in the north frontage and three in the east
frontage. The middle window in the east frontage has a typical
Mamluk iron grille; the other two are narrow slits.

The entrance portal (plate 37.1) at the south end of the
east frontage is remarkably plain. It consists ofa pointed-arched
recess containing the entrance door, which has been reduced
in width and height at some time. The original lintel, two
courses above the present one, is surmounted by a relieving
arch of simply-joggled voussoirs with rebated joints. In the
tympanum, one course above the relieving arch, is 4
rectangular recess with a bevelled border, which evidently was
intended to accommodate an inscription. The portal lacks the
customary stone benches on either side.

INTERIOR (plan, fig. 37.3)

Three steps lead up from the street to the entrance door, which
opens into a vaulted vestibule. A door in the far (west) wall of
the vestibule leads into a cross-vaulted chamber from which a
staircase rises west then east to the upper floors.

A doorway in the north wall of the vestibule leads into a
passage cut through a massive wall (2.31m thick) that seems to
be a remnant of an earlier structure. A deep recess (measuring
2.45m from west to east) opens in the east side of the passage.
It appears to have been hollowed out of the core of that massive
wall. It is lit from the street by a high-level slit window, and now
contains a privy.

The passage leads to a large hall (marked ‘a’ on the plan,

Jig. 37.3) lit by the grilled window in the east frontage. This hall
is roofed in three bays by barrel vaults at the east and west ends
and a taller vault between them. The centre vault may bea later
insertion, added when the upper floor was developed, in which
case this part of the hall will have been open to the sky.

A door in the middle of the north wall of hall ‘A’ leads into
hall ‘B’, which is now divided by later partitions that were
probably added to support load-bearing walls on the upper
floor. The hall is cross-vaulted and lit by a high-level slit
 window in the east wall and a larger window in a recess in the
north wall. A well-head in the south-east corner of the hall gives
access to a Cistern.

In the west wall of hall ‘B’ a door opens into what is now a
shop (‘Lions Gate Bazaar’), but which may once have formed
 part of the ribat. The shop comprises two vaulted rooms (C and
D), which are connected by a wide opening, presumably
modern, in the common wall. The shop’s wide doorway on the
street is obviously modern (see plate 37.3), perhaps replacing
an earlier window.

39,"I SITE AND BUILDING (plan, fig. 38.2)
","¢ Peel ete | PR Se See ees ee A ee ee oe

The minaret is built against the westernmost pier of an earlier
portico that extends westward from Bab al-Asbat. Around the
west and north sides of that pier, masonry was added to forma
base for the minaret. Although Mujir al-Din states that this
minaret like others around the Haram was probably built on
the foundations ofan earlier minaret, no trace of that is evident.

A pointed-arched portal in the south face of the masonry
base gives access to a staircase leading to the roof of the portico,
above which rises the minaret. The cylindrical stone shaft of the
minaret, divided into three ‘storeys’ by moulded string courses,
rests on a series of pyramidal buttresses carried on a masonry
plinth. A door in the east side of the plinth gives access to a
spiral staircase rising within the shaft to a corbelled muezzin’s
gallery.

There are indications that the shaft of the minaret was
reconstructed in the Ottoman period, and it is known that the
top of the shaft together with the muezzin’s gallery was
completely renewed in the 1920s.
 "
39,"Il HISTORY
","An inscription — now almost entirely effaced — on the lintel of
the entrance door was deciphered by van Berchem. It
commemorates the construction of the minaret in the reign of
Sultan al-Ashraf Sha‘ban during the superintendency of Sayf al-
Din Qutltibugha, Superintendent of the Two Harams, in the
year 769/1367-68.' This is confirmed by Mujir al-Din, who must
have seen the inscription in a more legible condition?

A modern inscription above that foundation inscription
States that the minaret was renewed by the Supreme Muslim
Council in 1346/1927-28. Early photographs’ show that this
renewal affected only the top of the minaret, which was entirely
replaced.
 "
39,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","ENTRANCE (plate 38.1; fig. 38.3)

A short flight of five steps rises eastward against the base of the
minaret to the threshold of the entrance portal. The portal
consists of a tall pointed-arched recess with a door in the rear
wall flanked by stone benches. The door lintel, still bearing
faint traces of the foundation inscription, is surmounted by a
relieving arch of red and cream-coloured ablaq joggled
voussoirs. Above this arch the stonework has been renewed
around the restoration inscription. The tympanum of the
 portal is filled with four tiers of muqarnas corbelling. The
portal arch is slightly recessed in the surrounding masonry and
framed by a cyma reversa moulding around the extrados.

The entrance door opens into a small vestibule from
which a dog-leg stair rises north, turns east then north again to
a landing with a blocked door in its west wall. This door
presumably led into a chamber within the base. From the first
landing the stair continues to rise northward before turning
east against the Haram’s north enclosing wall to emerge on the
roof of the portico. 4.30m to the south a door in the east side of
the masonry plinth (plate 38.2) leads to the spiral staircase
within the core of the minaret.

SHAFT (elevation, fig. 38.3; section, fig. 38.4; plate 38.1)

The masonry plinth supporting the minaret is rectangular in
plan, measuring 4.58m (the same size as the base) from east to
west and 4.00m from north to south. The top of the plinth is
chamfered on all four sides. The chamfering of the west side is
wider and deeper to reduce the top of the plinth to a square in
plan. Above the plinth a series of prismatic triangles and
pyramidal corner buttresses (see plate 38.2) makes the
transition from square to octagon. A roll moulding decorates
the top edge of the octagon, above which inverted muqarnas
niches round off the eight corners (see plate 38.3) to complete
the transition from the plinth to the cylindrical shaft.

The plain ashlar masonry of the shaft is relieved by three
moulded string courses and two friezes of incised joggling. The
lowest of the three ‘storeys’ is quite featureless except for two
slit windows, one facing roughly north and the other roughly
south, which light the internal staircase. A roll moulding
separates this storey from the next. Half-way up the second
storey are two circular windows, one facing roughly south-east,
the other north-west. The windows are surrounded by circular
panels of incised counterchange joggling which interrupt an
incised frieze of similar joggling (see plate 38.4). A cavetto
moulding decorated with a repeating muqarnas motif
separates the second storey from the third. A single north-
facing circular window surrounded by incised joggling
interrupts an incised frieze similar to that in the second storey.
On the west side of the shaft the continuity of this frieze is
broken by two stones incised with a more elaborate
counterchange motif (fig. 38.5), which surely indicates some
later rebuilding.

Ata level three courses above the frieze, the top courses of
the shaft and the muezzin’s gallery were dismantled and
 completely renewed in 1346/1927-28, possibly as a result of
damage caused by the earthquake in July 1927. Early
photographs such as the one cited in note 3 show that before
that renovation there was a south-facing circular window at the
same level as the north-facing one in the third storey and that
the muezzin’s gallery was supported by two tiers of continuous
circumferential corbelling (see plate 54.9). The present
muezzin’s gallery is supported by two tiers of muqarnas
corbelling which, like that used in the nearly contemporaneous
renovation of the Fakhriyya Minaret (no. 23), was evidently
modelled on corbelling at the Ghawanima Minaret (no. 10).

DATE
The base including the entrance portal with the foundation
 inscription is — apart from the incorporated pier of the earlier
Haram portico — obviously Mamlik. The plinth and zone of
transition appear to be integral with the base and so to be
Mamluk also. Similar zones of transition were used in eighth/
fourteenth-century minarets in Egypt’ and Syria.° The zone of
transition would support either an octagonal or a cylindrical
shaft. Octagonal-shafted minarets were common in Syria’ and
Palestine,” though none exists in Jerusalem. On the other hand,
we know of only two other eighth/fourteenth-century Mamluk
minarets with circular shafts, both in Aleppo” and both different
in style and execution from the Bab al-Asbat Minaret. All other
minarets with circular shafts in Jerusalem are Ottoman. One at
the Jamr' al-Mawlawiyya is surprisingly similar to the Bab al-
Asbat Minaret; it bears an unpublished inscription recording
 that it was built in 995/1586-87. Friezes of incised
counterchange joggling are also a common feature of Ottoman
minarets in Jerusalem such as one at the Tomb of David, which
is probably part of the conversion of that building into a
mosque in 930/1524.""°

There is some justification, therefore, to suppose that the
shaft of the Bab al-Asbat Minaret may be an Ottoman
 reconstruction. The zone of transition shows, however, that if
the present shaft is not Mamluk then the one it replaces must
have been either circular or octagonal. Mujir al-Din, in an
apparent allusion to its different shape from the other (square
tower) minarets, described it as the most graceful in form and
beautiful in appearance of the four minarets around the
Haram.!!

 "
40,"Il HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

The Bistamiyya Zawiya is located, according to Mujir al-Din,! in
the Easterners’ Quarter, the area to the north of the Haram.
There is no extant inscription. Later references in the Ottoman
period name its situation differently, either as the Bab Hitta
Quarter, within which the zawiya gave its name to a street, Khutt
al-Bistamiyya,” or as the Quarter ( maballa or hdra) of the Bani
Zayd.

The survey of the streets of Jerusalem carried out in 1865
by Sandreczki recorded a memory of the site of the Bistamiyya
as ‘the tomb or mazar of the Sheikh Bostamy’.. The
accompanying map located it in the first turning to the west (the
first thoroughfare, that is) which one encounters moving north
up the main north-south axis connecting the north side of the
Haram with Herod’s Gate (Bab al-Sahira)‘ but the present
zawiya is in the next street to the north.>

FOUNDER

This foundation is associated with a shaykh named Jalal al-Din
‘Abdallah b. Khalil b. ‘Ali al-Asadabadhi, a Sufi of the Bistamiyya
order which is named after the great ninth-century mystic, Aba
Yazid al-Bistami. Shaykh ‘Abdallah was born in Baghdad,
followed a career of scholarship there and became mu ‘id
(lecturer) in the Shafi‘t ‘Royal Madrasa’, the Nizamiyya.
However, when the Sufi shaykh ‘Ala’ al-Din ‘Ali al-Safi came to
Baghdad from Khurasan, ‘Abdallah became his disciple, gave
up his positions, donated his library for the use of students, and
 followed ‘Ala’ al-Din to Jerusalem, accepting a life of ‘asceticism
and taxing religious exercises after one of comfort and ease’.
When ‘Ala’ al-Din died on Thursday, 12 Safar 761/2 January
1360, ‘Abdallah succeeded him as head of the community. He
himself died in the zawiya (or simply ‘at Jerusalem’) in
Muharram 794/December 1391, and was buried near his
teacher in the enclosure of the Bistamiyya Siifis in the Mamilla
Cemetery.° A son, ‘Abd al-Hadi, had been born after 779/1377-
78. ‘His father’s followers gathered around him and he became
their shaykh’, but, having settled in Cairo, he died young in 809/
1406-7.

DATE

There is no suggestion that ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Safi had himself
provided the community with a regular zawiya before his
death. Mujir al-Din calls him ‘shaykh of the Bistdmiyya ascetics
(fugara’y,* and names Shaykh ‘Abdallah as the endower (wagqif)
and, rather vaguely, as the sahib (founder, head?) of the
Bistémiyya Zawiya.? However, it is no surprise to find that the
Defter no. 522, when it lists the three main sources of income
of the foundation, gives the donations of three individuals in
the following years, 774/1372-73, 776/1374-75 and 792/1390,!°
all dates before the death of Shaykh ‘Abdallah. One might
expect to find a Saff shaykh in a position to attract funding,
rather than to provide it.

The Haram documents offer evidence that the zawiya
existed before the death of Shaykh ‘Abdallah. Document no. 84
records the effects of a Turkish woman, living in religious
retreat (mujawira) — and probably mortally ill — in the Quarter
of the Easterners ‘near the zawiya of my lord the Shaykh
‘Abdallah al-Bistami (may God make his saintly life benefit all)’.
This was written in Dhi’l-Qa‘da 793/October 1391, that is, after
all the endowments mentioned above and only a little before
the Shaykh’s death. It cannot tell us in what form the zawiya
existed. However, Mujir al-Din says that it was in existence
before 770/1368-69.""!

ENDOWMENT

The three endowments mentioned above are listed in the
Defters nos. 522 and 602.'* They were three plantations outside
Jerusalem, in the case of the last two, with the buildings (buyzit)
erected on them included. One was in the Biqa‘ land,'? the
endowment of al-Hajj ‘Umar b. ‘Abdallah al-Hadi in 774/1372-
73, another, the location of which was not specified,’* was
donated to the zawiya by Muhammad b. Isma‘il, the Nagib, in
 776/1374-75, and the third was ‘in the Bani Sa‘d Quarter’ and
was the waqf of Muqbil al-Tawashi in 792/1390.'> This financial
support from the two persons of the ‘Mamlik’ class, along with,
as it appears, one Glim figure, may be compared with the
endowment of the Qiramiyya Zawiya by an amir from Gaza (see
p. 476).

It is also recorded, but without any details, that a house in
the Zahiriyya Hill Street in Jerusalem belonged to the waaf of
the zawiya, as did a parcel of land near Ramla. The income from
the latter is given as 1,456 aspers.'°

A Haram document, no. 538, dated 793/1391, records the
death of a man ‘in a house belonging to the waqf of the
Bistamiyya on the Mawla Steps (Darajat al-Mawla)’. This house
is not mentioned among the assets of the zawiya in the Defter.
A further document, no. 461, speaks of a woman from Ayntab
‘residing in the Easterners’ Quarter in the house which is the
wadf of our late Lord, the Shaykh ‘Abdallah al-Bistami.’ Note the
‘late’ — the date of the document is 21 Jumada II 796/23 April
1394.""” Does this mean a house endowed by or on the shaykh?
Probably the former, which may to some extent support Mujir
al-Din’s description of ‘Abdallah as the waif of the zawiya, if
indeed the zawiya was the beneficiary.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

One later shaykh of the zawiya is mentioned by Mujir al-Din, a

certain Shihab al-Din Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Kurdi, who died

in 881/1476-77. He was a Shafi‘T and also held positions in the

madrasa and the khangah of Saladin, '8
In 964/1556 the then administrator of the waqf reported
 that the roofs of the zawiya were in need of repair. The
estimated cost was 2,000 aspers.’? Later, in 1018/1609, the
inspector of the zawiya again listed repairs that were required
at an estimated cost of 3,300 paras. Features expressly
mentioned were ‘two rooms (baytayn) on the west side’, ‘an
upper chamber (hujra)’, ‘three windows (sing. taqa) in need of
wooden shutters (abwab)’.?°

MODERN HISTORY ;

By 1927 the place had become ‘very much neglected’ even
though the then guardian, Shaykh Misa al-Ghusayn, lived with
his family above the zawiya. It is in good order nowadays (plate
39.7); apart from the areas around the two graves the building
has been adapted for domestic use and is lived in by members
of the Hammar family.
 "
40,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","STREET FRONTAGE (plate 39.1)

The street frontage of the Bistamiyya consists of a high wall of
coursed rubble pierced only by a low semicircular arch, now
blocked (plate 39.2), at the west end and, at the east end, by the
pointed-arched entrance portal of the zawiya.

ENTRANCE (plate 39.3)

The entrance portal is built of finely carved ashlars set into the
rubble masonry of the street wall. Over the left part runs an
unusual cornice carved with a series of protruding muqamas
elements; the right-hand part of the cornice is missing (plate
 39.4). It returns a short distance southwards at the left-hand
end. Since this return runs not at right-angles to the rest of the
cornice but at an angle of about 110°, it seems likely that the
cornice was originally intended for some other building.
Indeed, the manner in which the ashlar portal is set into the
rubble masonry of the street wall indicates that the whole
portal was inserted into that earlier wall. This may have
occurred when the shaykh’s house was formally established
and endowed as a zawiya.

Four steps now lead down to the threshold of the entrance
doorway at the back of the portal recess, suggesting that the
street level has risen about a metre since the portal was built
(see section, fig. 39.3). The monolithic lintel over the entrance
is supported at each end on small shoulders carved with three
tiers of muqarnas (plate 39.5). Stone benches flank either side
of the recess.

The vault over the recess is curious (plate 39.4). It springs
from three points: the front two springings are tucked in
behind the quirked ogee springers of the portal arch and the
third springing, decorated with fluting, is in the centre of the
rear wall above the doorway. Although much obscured by
successive coats of plaster and paint, the triangular vaulting
pattern can still be discerned rising to a small hexagonal cupola
at the crown (see plan, fig. 39.2).

INTERIOR (figs. 39.2-39.4).

The very irregular arrangement of multifarious rooms varying
in size and construction technique gives the impression that
the zawiya was established in an existing group of loosely
related structures. The architectural detailing and the masonry
of the walls is quite heterogeneous, and the floor levels vary
considerably (see sections, figs. 39.3 and 39.4).

On the assumption that the entrance portal was added at
about the time when the zawiya was formally established
before 770/1368, as seems likely, it is possible to assign other
parts of the building to the same period on the basis of their
similar masonries. While the bulk of the visible masonry is
rubble, the vestibule, the staircase, the eastern part of the south
wall of the courtyard and the splay-face cornice over the whole
south wall are built of ashlars dressed in the same manner as
those of the portal, as delineated in fig. 39.4. The conjunctions
between these areas of ashlar and rubble suggest that the
rubble walling is earlier than the ashlar, as appears also to be
the case on the street frontage (above).

Of the earlier structures two, the northern chamber on the
east side and the southern chamber on the west side of the
courtyard, belong now to neighbouring houses. Another of the
earlier structures, the western chamber on the south side of the
courtyard (marked ‘X’ on the plan), originally opened on it
through an arch like a small zwdan (fig. 39.4). At least one of the
voussoirs of the arch must have been re-used since it alone has
border fillets in the quadrant chamfer moulding around the
intrados of the arch. The rubble arch opening into the
split-level chamber at the northern end of the west wall of
 side of entrance door

the courtyard is undecorated. At the back of this chamber is the
smaller of the two cenotaphs (plate 39.6).

The later ashlar masonry is more sophisticated. The
staircase, built across the front of an earlier room, has an arch
under it to maintain access to the room. This arch has an oddly-
shaped head (fig. 39.3) decorated witha splay-face moulding in
a style strangely reminiscent of Crusader architecture.
Nonetheless, the quality of the carving is indifferent, just as one
might expect in this comparatively insignificant and
impecunious foundation of the eighth/fourteenth century.

A symmetrical arrangement (plate 39.7, Jig. 39.4) of two
rectangular windows flanking a horseshoe-arched recess
contains the doorway leading to two deep chambers at the
 south-east corner of the complex. Both chambers have a
mibrab. The eastern one, divided by a fine timber screen of
some antiquity (plate 39.8) houses the larger of the two
cenotaphs (plate 39.9). The present inhabitants of the
Bistamiyya claim that it marks the grave of Abii Yazid al-Bistami
himself, and that the smaller one in the north-western chamber
is his wife’s. These attributions are of course apocryphal; Abu
Yazid is buried in Iran. Chances are that the graves belong to
later shaykhs of the zawiya buried according to custom in the
local home of their order.

Some modern alterations have been made: in the west
room on the south side and in the south room on the east side
of the courtyard the vaulting has been hacked away, probably to
 raise the practical ceiling height; and the zwédn arch and the
arch under the stair have been largely built up to form

doorways more appropriate to the bedrooms which their
associated chambers have now become.

pages 432 to 433.
 "
41,"Ill HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

According to Mujir al-Din the Lu’lu’iyya Madrasa is situated in
the Marzuban district of Jerusalem ‘in the vicinity of the Bath of
‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir, on the north side’. As the precise location
of the Bath is not known, this is not especially useful. However,
Mujir al-Din also states that the Badriyya Madrasa is ‘close’ to
the Lu'lu’iyya,' and the Badriyya, situated on the west side of the
present Qirami Street, is known from its inscription.”

DATE

We learn from Mujir al-Din that ‘the madrasa was in existence
in the year 781 [1379-80].° We have no date for the construction
of the madrasa, but the Ottoman defters inform us that the
endowment document was dated 775/1373-74,' so it is likely
that the madrasa was built around about that date.

FOUNDER

The madrasa was endowed by the Amir Badr al-Din Lu’lu’
Ghazi, the freedman of the Sultan al-Ashraf Sha‘ban b. Husayn.
This sultan came to the throne at the age of ten, and after a reign
of just under fourteen years was deposed and executed in 778/
1377. Lu'lu’ lived on to 787/1385-86.? Two Haram documents,
dating from the 1390s, mention a tenement (in David Street
(quarter], Khutt Da’td) belonging to aLu'lu’ Ghazi al-Tawashi.®
If this is the same man as the founder, the use of that term might
suggest that Lu'lu’ was a eunuch, as would his personal name.
Yet, as will be seen later, the Jerusalem Sijills refer to the
descendants of the founder. Biographical details on the life of
the founder are wanting. He appears not to have been of
 sufficient eminence to warrant mention in chronicles or
biographical dictionaries.

ENDOWMENT

The defters make it clear that the endowment of Lu’lu’ Ghazi
was not only for his madrasa, but also supported a zawiya (see
p. 434) and a ribat. The main source of income was from the
village of Bayt Sawir, situated between Jerusalem and Hebron,
which was wholly given over to the maintenance of the
institutions. Defter 522 records the annual rental value of the
village as 2,000 aspers, but in Defter 602 it is 1,000 aspers. Other
small properties are mentioned. The tenement in Jerusalem
has already been mentioned. In 941/1535 the administrator of
the waqf leased for two years a plot of land in the Zuqaq al-‘Izam
(Bones Lane?) in Jerusalem for a down payment of 40 paras.’ By
1021/1612 we find that the admistrators of ‘ruined houses’ in
the Zuqaq al-‘Izam, referred to as the waqf ofLu’lu’ al-Ghazi, are
settling accounts with the lessees for the sums the latter have
spent on repairs.® A hakiira (garden plot) belonging to the
waqf of Lu’lu’ Ghazi is mentioned in a sijill entry of 1066/1655-
56.” These and other properties are referred to summarily ina
document of 985/1577 as ‘the income of the madrasa’s waqf
from Bayt Sawir and the shops and houses (dir), etc.’

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

In a sijill entry dated 985/1577 the mudarris of the Lu’lu’iyya is
named as Shaykh Abii ’I-‘Inayat b. Abi ’l-Huda al-Ghazzi.'' What
is interesting is that he is also acting as agent for the two
daughters, Sutayta and Latifa, of Muhammad al-Hariri, who are
described as ‘the administrators of the waqf of their ancestor
(jadd),""” Lu'lw Ghazi’. The account presented by him shows that
he received from the village of Bayt Sawir 35 mudds of wheat
and 20 of barley, which, when sold, raised 215 paras. Of these,
38 went on administrative expenses connected with the
distribution of money to beneficiaries, 40 were spent on repair
of the zawiya (see p. 434), and 11 were spent on maintenance

His appointment dated from 975/1567-68. As we have already
 not given, but two others named received one asper daily and
the fourth person, called administrator (sic) and bawwab,
received two aspers each day.

MODERN HISTORY
The modern history of the madrasa is not well documented. In
the caption to a photograph taken in 1854 of the facade of the
Lu'lu’iyya (plate 40.1) Auguste Salzmann called it ‘?Auberge
d’Allemagne’, without further details.’ Nowadays the deep
vaults to the south of the madrasa are in use as a haberdashery
shop and store. The madrasa, when we first surveyed it in the
summer of 1982, was littered with piles of debris (see plate
40.7) and in the absence of an adequate drainage system a
makeshift dam across the west iwvdn retained (more or less) the
viscid noisome contents of a cesspool fed by a latrine on the
upper floor. Early in 1983 a new drain was installed, the floor of
the madrasa cleared, blocked openings re-opened and walls
and vaults cement-rendered under the supervision of the
Awqaf Administration’s Department of Islamic Archaeology.
Following this work we were able to extend our survey to
include previously inaccessible areas.

The upper floor is now used as a dwelling by members of
the Asmar family.

IV ARCHITECTURE

THE MADRASA

(t) Masonry and stonework

The first indication that an earlier structure once occupied the
site on which the Lu’lu’iyya now stands is to be found in the
large, roughly dressed masonry that forms the lowest three
courses of the facade (fig. 40.6, plate 40.2). Although the
presence of a different type of masonry in the lowest courses
does not necessarily denote the remains of an earlier building
 THE MADRASA

() Masonry and stonework

The first indication that an earlier structure once occupied the
site on which the Lu’lu’iyya now stands is to be found in the
large, roughly dressed masonry that forms the lowest three
courses of the facade (fig. 40.6, plate 40.2). Although the
presence of a different type of masonry in the lowest courses
does not necessarily denote the remains of an earlier building
(above, p. 439), there is reason to think that it does so here. The
east wall which forms the street facade is unusually thick
(1.54m) and its thickness seems to have been determined by
the previous existence of the three lowest courses; while
construction of both the main entrance and the door to the
southern vaults has clearly involved breaking through these
lowest courses (plate 40.3). What that earlier structure might
have been is not known, though its eastern boundary appears
to coincide with that of the present construction.

Above the earlier masonry the facade is composed of
much smaller stones. The dressing of these stones is very
distinctive, each one having one or occasionally two panels of
picked rustication bordered by a plain marginal draft (plate
40.3). Around the window and door openings the masonry is
dressed smoothly, which suggests either that the rusticated
stones are in secondary use and the masons cut only the more
elaborately shaped stones around the Openings or,
alternatively, that the rusticated stones were dressed by one
group of masons and the smooth stones around openings by
another. Similarly rusticated masonry found only 100m from
the Lu’lu’iyya in the chevet of a partly rebuilt church (plate
40.4), possibly the twelfth-century Church of StJulian, confirms
that the rusticated masonry may be in secondary use. The same
sort of rusticated masonry in the north wall of the nearly
contemporaneous Hanbaliyya Madrasa (781/1380) is used
above two courses of much larger stones, as at the Lu'lu’iyya.

A few odd pieces of this masonry are found in the interior
of the Lu’lu’iyya in places that were originally plastered over.
This does not mean to say that there was a surplus of stones
available for re-use. Damaged or otherwise unsuitable stones,
either newly-cut or re-used, could well have been deemed
inappropriate for use on the facade and relegated to the
general construction of interior walls and vaults, There are,
however, several stones without the distinctive rustication in
the upper part of the facade, which Suggests that the stones

were being re-used and that the supply had been exhausted by
that stage,!°
 Se alata ne cin tees Ee rahe ooh age eh tonne hem) fe meds
poor quality masonry. This generally consists of roughly
squared stones laid in regular courses, originally all covered
with a coat of plaster. Openings are spanned by simple arches
of crude workmanship or by thin lintels, most of which have
cracked. Yet in places where the stonework was not plastered
it is of a high quality. The quoins and frontal arches of the four
iwans are of well-cut ashlars as are two doorways in the passage
behind the south Zvdaz (below, p. 428). These doorways have
flat, undercut relieving arches over their lintels similar to those
over the windows in the facade.

(ii) Compostion of the Facade (fig. 40.6, plates 40.2, 40.3 and
40.5).

The tall and extensive street facade is imposing despite the
simplicity of its decoration and its partial obstruction by
strainer arches built in 1976 to resist an alarming outward lean
that the facade had developed, possibly as a result of the 1927
earthquake. A continuous quirked ogee moulding separates
the ground floor from the upper floor. This moulding provides
a clue to the extent of the complex. At the north (right-hand)
end of the facade it returns (plate 40.6) to include a small room
spanning the street (marked ‘A’ on the upper floor plan, fig.
40.5). At the south end it runs across the entrance to the vaults
south of the madrasa and continues half-way across a buttress-
like tower built into the re-entrant angle of the street corner. A
simpler cavetto moulding forms a cornice over the upper
storey. This too extends half-way across the tower at the south

Meith, east tae

 end but is now missing from the north end of the facade.

The composition of the facade is asymmetrical. At the left
(south) end, adjacent to the corner tower, a doorway
surmounted by a window opens into the southern vaults. This
doorway has been altered relatively recently; its original form
may be seen in a photograph taken by Creswell in 1920 (plate
40.3). Next is the main feature of the facade: the entrance portal.
It is a simple pointed-arched recess decorated with re-used
marble imposts (see above, p. 95) and a splay-face moulding
around the extrados of the red and cream-coloured ablaq
voussoirs. At the rear of the recess the doorway, also built in
ablaq masonry, is surmounted in the tympanum of the arch by
a rectangular grilled window lighting a vestibule. Beyond the
portal are two windows at different levels opening into the east
twan of the madrasa; the higher of these is now obstructed by
one of the modern arches. There is a third window, which
Opens into a room in the north-east corner of the site.

Above the quirked ogee moulding the fenestration (plate
40.5) reflects the disposition and importance of the first floor
rooms. Above the portal and the door to the left are two pairs
of rectangular mullioned windows each surmounted by a
circular oculus and, above that, a slit window (one of which is
now blocked); these all light an important reception hall that
once enjoyed a fine view to the east (plate 40.19). To the right
are two single rectangular windows of diminishing size lighting
rooms ‘B’ and ‘C’ (fig. 40.5).

(iii) Ground floor

The modest pointed-arched entrance leads into a cross-vaulted
vestibule. On the right (north) side of this there is a plain door
leading into the east zwén of the madrasa, which comprised a
central courtyard roofed by a folded cross-vault with an
octagonal oculus at the crown. The west, north and east sides of
the courtyard are confronted by deep Zwdmns, but on the south
side there is only a shallow recess, with no mibrab but a
doorway in the centre (plate 40.7). This door, as will appear
from its description given below, was evidently the main
entrance to the madrasa, rather than the door entering the east
iwan from the vestibule. Irregularly-shaped chambers fill the
north-east and north-west corners between the other zwdmns.

To enter a madrasa through the gibla wall, dispensing with
a mibrab, was quite out of the ordinary, and is hard to explain
except by exigencies of the site and the necessity of adapting
the accommodation to pre-existing structures. The gibla iwan,
usually the deepest but here used simply for an entrance, was
too shallow for assembly for tuition or prayers. Teaching must
have been conducted in one or more of the other three zwans.
 This can never have been very satisfactory since the whole
madrasa was lit and ventilated only by the roof light over the
central courtyard and windows in the eastern 7wan. That iwan
was lit, before 1976, by two windows set at different levels in the
east wall, the higher central, the lower toward the right (plate
40.8). To the left, where for symmetry a third window might
have been expected, there is only a deep niche. If that was once
a window no trace of it remains in the outer face of the wall.

Returning now to the vestibule we may explore the
structures which, on the south and west sides, restricted the
area available to the planners of the madrasa.

Facing the outer portal, the west wall of the vestibule has
been radically altered in modern times. The present doorway
on the west side (plate 40.9) gives access through a short
passage into a staircase leading up to the first floor. The
doorway is not original. The original doorway was in the right
half of the wall, and its lintel is still in position. Except for a
small window-like aperture, that has now been blocked up. It
gave access to a barrel-vaulted passage along the south wall of
the madrasa. Half-way along the passage, on the right side, is the
well-built doorway (plate 40.10) which leads into the south
iwan of the madrasa. The carefully dressed and jointed jambs
and lintel of this doorway (surmounted by a joggled keystone
between two cantilever stones relieving the lintel) and the
cavetto mouldings on either side show that it belongs to the
original construction and was in fact the main entrance to the
madrasa.

——
 The far end of the passage is partly obstructed by an
obtrusive rubble shaft (plate 40.11) which connects an
underlying cistern to a well-head in the upper floor. The shaft
is obviously a later insertion, possibly replacing an original
well-head at this level. Beyond it a doorway, (plate 40.11, fig.
40.7) constructed of ashlar masonry with a flat relieving arch
over the lintel like the main entrance to the madrasa, leads into
a vaulted chamber (now largely filled with debris) and on to an
irregular arrangement of vaults and arches (plate 40.12). These
appear to belong to an earlier structure. They extend along the
west side of the madrasa past an undecorated doorway into the
west iwan and on to a blocked opening which apparently led
to a second staircase at the north-west corner of the site, giving
access to the upper floor. Subsequent alterations made in
adapting the building to domestic use (see below) have
obliterated all remains of the staircase, except that the vaulting
of the passage rises eastwards towards the blocked Opening as
if to roof such a staircase (plate 40.13) and the vaulting of the
north-west corner room has been kept low as if to carry it. A
staircase in this position would have supplemented the main
Staircase from the vestibule, permitting direct access from the
madrasa to the upper floor through the doorway in the west
iwan. In this way students could come and go between the
school and their lodgings on the upper floor, while the founder
reached his private apartments by the main staircase.

(wv) Mezzanine (fig. 40.4)

That main staircase serving the upper floor was formerly
entered by an opening (which no longer exists) close to the
near (east) end of the passage, where its position is indicated by
a small transverse excision in the barrel vault over the bottom
Stair. It lay conveniently close to the main doorway into the
madrasa.

The staircase led up to a large landing now roofed with
steel beams and concrete — a late-nineteenth or twentieth-
century technique.’ Presumably it was originally vaulted,
though the floor-to-floor height between the landing and the
courtyard above is only about 2.5m —a very shallow space in
which to construct a traditional vault to span the 2.93 x 2.91m
landing.

A simple doorway leads off the landing into a cross-vaulted
chamber to the west. This chamber is said by local inhabitants
to contain a tomb, but when the debris that filled it was cleared
out in May 1983 no trace of a tomb was found.

To the east of the landing a very low and narrow L-shaped
room sits over the passageway below (shown in section, fig.
40.7). The entrance to this room was presumably off the
 landing although there is no sign of a doorway there. Until it
was blocked in 1983 that room could be entered through a
high-level opening in the rear wall of the gibla twain (see plate
40.7). There was also a tiny window opening just under the
vault of the vestibule (plate 40.9).

(v) Upper floor (fig. 40.5)

From the mezzanine landing a flight of eleven steps leads
northwards to the main upper floor. Of the original
accommodation on this level only the eastern range
overlooking the street survives intact. The rooms on the north,
west and south sides all appear to have been rebuilt, though
their arrangement around an open courtyard probably follows
the original layout. The octagonal oculus of the madrasa opens
in an irregular masonry plinth (see figs. 40.5, 40.7 and 40.8) on
the east side of the courtyard, which is now filled with a jumble
of concrete-block walls and shacks (plate 40.14).

At the north side of the courtyard there is nothing but the
remains of the springing of a vault in the north-east corner to
establish the former existence of structures there.

Of the rooms on the west side only the two southern ones
appear possibly to be more or less original; the others have
been largely rebuilt. The entrance to the southernmost room is
situated, like that of the western room of the south range, over
the staircase landing. The staircase itself arrives at the upper
courtyard beside the doorway of the central room on the west
side. This room is now divided to form latrines and a corridor
leading to a western courtyard surrounded by a further group
of rooms, not included in the survey. The western courtyard
and its associated rooms lie beyond the west boundary of the
madrasa on the ground floor but it is possible that they once
served as ancillary accommodation for the madrasa. They can
be reached now only by way of the main staircase. The
architectural style of these buildings is Ottoman but here too
there are signs of considerable rebuilding. In this western
courtyard there is another well-head, formed from a hollowed-
out column base (plate 40.15), over a second cistern located
just north of the deepest of the ‘southern vaults’.

On the south side of the principal courtyard there are two
cross-vaulted chambers. The eastern one originally opened on
the courtyard as an iwéin. The springer and two voussoirs of the
frontal arch survive, along with traces of a splay-face moulding
around its extrados at the south-east corner of the courtyard
(plate 40.16). Atsome time the arch collapsed and was replaced
by a new wall, the upper part of which is formed in concrete.

narrow flight of steps cut into its north wall to give access to the
roof. The lowest steps are missing, as are others higher up
where a new window has been opened (p/ate 40.17),

The east range consists of three handsome rooms and the
small chamber (A) spanning the street. Whatever the Original
purpose of this small chamber over the street was, it now serves
as a bathroom. Windows with low sills in both north and south
walls (seen in section, fig. 40.6) allow full advantage to be taken
of the lively views up and down the street, perhaps originally
from behind mashrabiyya screens. Access to it is from the north
room of the east range. Built into the north wall of this room
there is a re-used stone decorated with a scallop shell motif
(plate 40.18) reminiscent of the tiny squinches often used in
Ayyubid dome construction but here carved on a flat surface
with a ‘broken arch’ frame of the type often found in the rear
walls of water fountains. Its original purpose is unknown.

The central room of the east range, entered from the
oculus plinth, is set back from the line of the other rooms to
allow clearance for the folded cross-vault of the madrasa, which
rises higher than the other vaults. Its floor is at the same level
as the others in the east range, requiring three steps down to it
from the plinth. There is a door in the south-west corner,
placed so as to open on the centre of the adjoining room to the
south. This latter room comprised two cross-vaulted bays each
lit by a double window with central mullion. It was entered
from the courtyard by a door on the axis of the northern bay;
and the door (mentioned above) in the centre of the north wall
gave access to the adjoining room. A modern partition now
divides the two halves of the room and has necessitated the
opening of a new doorway to connect the southern half to the
courtyard.

By analogy with other roughly contemporaneous Mamlik
foundations like the Manjakiyya (above, pp. 384-398) and the
Tashtamuriyya (below, pp. 460-474) it seems likely that this east
range of rooms served as the residence of the founder, the
Amir Lu’lu’ Ghazi. The double-bayed room with its anteroom
to the north and its fine view of the Dome of the Rock (plate
40.19) would have been an appropriate place for him to receive
his guests. As for the rest of the upper floor, it is now too much
altered for it to be possible to deduce how it might have been
used originally, whether for accommodating students and
teachers attached to the madrasa or as part of the founder’s
residence or as a combination of hoth
 SOUTHERN VAULTS (Jig. 40.5)

(i) Street vaults

The main series of vaults to the south of the madrasa extends
25.5m westwards exactly on the alignment of the present street
which leads eastwards from them to join the valley street, Tariq
al-Wad, opposite the west entrance to the Siiq al-Qattanin (see
location plan, fig. 40.1). At the west end of the last vault there is
what appears to be an arched opening, now blocked ( plate
40.20). If this series of vaults were to continue for a further 26m
westwards it would open into the Siig al-Khawajat, one of the
parallel triple markets.’* It is conceivable therefore that these
vaults are built on the line of some much earlier street whose
existence can be detected only in their alignment. Nothing can
be deduced from their construction since all are plastered.
(ii) Vaulted chambers to the south

A further two vaulted chambers to the south are entered from
 the first of the street vaults (plate 40.21). Both are solidly built
with squared masonry walls and rubble cross vaults; an ashlar
transverse arch separates the two vaults. Cutting across the
north end of the more easterly of these chambers is a staircase
leading up from the street to various dwellings to the south and
west of the Lu’lu’iyya, built partly over the ‘street vaults’. This
staircase was obviously built after the vault it cuts through. It
was probably built after the Lu’'lu’iyya also, for at the upper level
it runs against the wall of the room (D) in the upper floor of the
madrasa (plan, fig. 40.5).

originally have existed in the chamber at the south-west corner
of the madrasa, now filled with debris). The extension of the
first floor of the madrasa over part of the southern vaults and
the continuity of masonry and mouldings on the facade indicate
that the vaults were owned by the founder of the madrasa. They
might have been intended for commercial use to augment the
revenues of the madrasa’s endowment. Alternatively, they may
have served as the lodgings or hospice mentioned in Haram

walls of Cairo (480/1087) include similarly rusticated masonry (MAE, i, pl. 124c)
as do those parts of the walls of Aleppo that were repaired by the Mamluk Sultan
Qansih al-Ghirt in the early tenth/sixteenth century (CIA (Alep), pl. xxib).

there is no need of such strong walls and foundations as when every room was
vaulted with stones’.

42,"lil HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION
The Lu’lu'iyya Zawiya according to Mujir al-Din! was located ‘at
the Damascus Gate (Bab al-‘Amiid), one of the gates of the city’.
 Ina sijill entry of 963/1555 the boundaries of a house at the top
of the Damascus Gate steps are recorded in the following
fashion: to the south a waqf property of the Lu’lu iyya Zawiya, to
the east the zawiya itself, to the north the tomb chamber (turba)
of the Lu’lu’iyya and to the west the road.” The tomb clearly
remained an important element. In 1865 Sandreczki identified
the building as a shrine, the inmate having been converted in
typical fashion into a holy man: ‘Turning around southward in
to the Damascus Gate street we passed by the Mazar of Sheikh
Lulu’.

DATE

The endowment for the Lu’lu’iyya Madrasa, which was dated
775/1373-74, also provided for ‘his zawiya and his ribat’, so both
these were no doubt built around about that date. The ribat
itself is something of a mystery. It seems to have been a separate
institution, if we accept the evidence of a sijill entry of 1050/
1640, in which the east boundary of a house in Zuqagq al-‘Izam
in the David Street quarter is given as the Lu’lu’iyya Ribat.4

FOUNDER
Mujir al-Din expressly identified the founder of the Lu’lu’iyya

Zawiya with the founder of the madrasa of that same name’ (see
p. 424).

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

As we have seen, the original endowment supported both the
zawiya and the madrasa. The waqf property in the vicinity of the
Damascus Gate, mentioned above, may have been exclusively
for the zawiya. It is not mentioned with the property that was
held in common. It could of course have been a later
endowment.

The income from the village of Bayt Sawir, or some part of
the income, for the year 950/1543-44 was applied wholly to the
zawiya.° The total was 2,440 aspers. The only expenditure
specified was as follows: 100 for the administrator, Muhammad
b. Muhammad al-Hariri, whose two daughters we have met as
his successors in the administration of the madrasa, 60 for
Shaykh Ahmad b. Jama‘a al-Manifi, 180 for the rent collector
(quite possibly the same man as the administrator), and 80 for
the clerk. In addition, 300 were spent on repairs to the zawiya
(for a builder and labourers for 90 days), and 144 met the
demands of the ‘shr (the tithe) for the timar-holder.

Apart from the reference to the spending of some of the
income of the madrasa on repairs to the zawiya in 985/1577,’ no
 other mention of this zawiya has been met with in the sijills.
Asali records the appointment of a Mustafa b. Wali al-Rami as
imam and shaykh in 1061/1651.° The sijills almost certainly
contain more information of this nature, as the zawiya
continues in existence down to the present day, known as the
Mosque of Shaykh Lu’lu’.

The entrance door is set in a pointed-arched recess 1.40m
deep. The voussoirs of the arch are gadrooned on the outer
face and soffit. The right-hand (south) side of the portal is
largely obscured by a later building. Stone benches on either
side of the recess flank the entrance door, which has a plain
monolithic lintel. The tympanum of the arch appears to have
been rebuilt at some time; it contains a modern inscription
announcing the ‘Mosque of Shaykh Lu’lu’’.

43,"lil HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

The only literary evidence known to us is the brief note in Mujir
al-Din, in which he places the Hanbaliyya Madrasa in the Bab al-
Hadid [district].' A few sijill entries of the mid-sixteenth century
concern the leasing of the apartment (tabaqa) built on the roof
of the Hanbaliyya, ‘near the Bab al-Hadid’, and other roof space,
which is described as the ‘roof of the passage (ma bar)’, ‘the
roof of the corridor (dibliz) of the place’s privies’, and ‘the roof
of the cell (khalwa) to the left of the entrance’. The narrow strip
— it is given as 1% ‘carpenters’ cubits’ east to west and 10 north
to south? — was bounded by the roof of the privies to the south,
the lane (darb) leading to the Cotton-Merchants’ Market to the
east and partly on the north side as well, by property belonging
to the lessee on the rest of the north side and to the west by an
open court of the place and also by the unbuilt-on roofs of the
northern cells.*

DATE

Building began in the last days of Jumada II [781]/3-12 October
1379, and was completed at the end of Shawwal 781/7 February
1380, according to Mujir al-Din.’ It is recorded by one historian
that Baydamur, the founder, was freed from prison in
Alexandria on 5 Tumada I 781/19 August 1379 and went to live
 in Jerusalem.’ He was quite soon restored to favour and re-
appointed governor of Syria in Muharram 782/April 1380.°
However, this report does connect Baydamur in person with
Jerusalem at the start of the building.

FOUNDER

The Amir Sayf al-Din Baydamur al-Khwarizmi was a personage
of some note in the chronicles of the second half of the
fourteenth century,’ but no other foundation attributed to him
is known other than the Hanbaliyya Madrasa, for which he is
named as the founder by Mujir al-Din.

He was born in 712/1312-13. First he was in the service of
the Amir Nasir al-Din b. Qarasunqur, and then of the Amir
Shaykhi, and rose steadily in rank, holding a series of offices,
such as that of district governor of the Jordan Valley (al-
Aghwar), chief chamberlain of Damascus, governor of Aleppo,
then of Damascus. This last post he first acquired in 761/1360.
In the confused politics of the period and in the difficult years
during which Barqig rose to the sultanate, Baydamur’s career
was interrupted by many imprisonments. He was on six
separate occasions appointed to the governorate of Damascus.*
He is said to have been of the party of Barka al-Jubani, Barquq’s
main rival. Ibn Taghribirdi suggests that Baydamur, like
another senior amir of the time, was submissive to the wielders
of power (ashab al-shawka) because of his fondness for office.”
However, it was as a result of suspicion that he had been
implicated in a plot against the life of Barqaq by the Royal
Mamliks that Baydamur was arrested in Ramadan 788/
September 1386.'°

His fate after that is for some chroniclers obscure, but one
account maintains that he became ill while imprisoned in the
citadel of Damascus, died in Safar 789/February-March 1387,
and mes buried in his mausoleum near the mosque of Karim al-
Din.

The historian, Ibn Hajar, states that his ttue name was
Zakariya b. ‘Abdallah b. Ayyab, but offers no explanation for this
statement.” His interest in books — every Ramadan he would
have readings from the Traditions of Bukhari in the governor's
residence in Damascus — and his good administration are
remarked upon.

His family kept up a hostility to Barquq. His son,
Muhammad Shah, after a brief flirtation with the Sultan,
followed the rebel Mintash and was executed in 793/1391, as
was another relative, Jibril al-Khwarizmi.* In 796/1394 the
bones of Muhammad Shah were restored to the family and
buried with his father’s remains. The Sultan Bargqigq also
 returned all, or some at least, of his properties to the family.""4
Muhammad Shah’s daughter had married Nasir al-Din
Muhammad, a grandson of Manjak, with whom Baydamur’s
own career had been linked.!5

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

Only one mudarris of the Hanbaliyya is known by name for the
Mamluk period. The Shaykh Burhan al-Din Ibrahim b. ‘Ali b.
Abi 'l-Wafa’ al-Is‘ardi al-Shafi'i (b. 805 or 6/1402-3, d. 887/1492-
93), after he had come to settle in Jerusalem, was appointed to
that post by the Sultan Jaqmagq.'° One other name from the late
Ottoman period was found by Asali in a sijill entry for the year
1242/1826-27, although this appointment was most likely
purely a formal one.!”

In the sixteenth-century sijills previously referred to,!8 the
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Karim b. Husayn al-Khalwati, described as a
settler in Jerusalem, rented from ‘the sadministrators of the
place known as the Hanbaliyya Madrasa’, or alternatively from
the Qadi of Jerusalem, ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Uthmani al-Hanafi,
 "
43,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","STREET FRONTAGES
The Hanbaliyya has two street frontages, one facing north-east
on Tariq Bab al-Hadid, the other facing east on the lane leading
to Sug al-Qattanin. At the corner where the two frontages meet
the east wall is set back 0.97m to accommodate the entrance
portal, which faces east down the street towards the Haram gate
(see plan, fig. 42.3). Sch
The masonry of the frontage on Tariq Bab al-Hadid is
 particularly interesting. The two lowest courses at the west end
are of large roughly-dressed stones (plate 42.1). At first glance
these might seem to be remains of some older structure, but
this is unlikely for they appear to be old stones re-used to
underpin an awkward corner where two walls meet at an acute
angle on sloping ground (see fig. 42.3). The upper courses of
masonry are more or less regular in height and contain several
stones with one or occasionally two panels of picked
rustication like those in the facade of the Lu’lu’iyya (above, p.
426). The masonry of the east frontage is unremarkable apart
from a few similarly rusticated stones. There are no windows
except for a slit in the east frontage some 2.20m south of the
portal.

 finely.dressed limestone ashlars enclosed by a quirked ogee
frame moulding. The left-hand (south) jamb of the recess is
now largely concealed by a masonry infill supporting later
vaults that span the street, though the frame moulding can still
be discerned through a gap between the jamb and the infill.
The later vaults conceal the upper part of the moulding.

The doorway is flanked by the customary stone benches.
The frame moulding extends across the base of the jambs of the
recess and continues around the top and bottom of the
benches. The chalky monolithic door lintel is now badly
eroded and appears to be on the brink of collapse. The load on
it is relieved somewhat by a flat relieving arch of elaborately
joggled red and black ablaq voussoirs.

INTERIOR (plan, fig. 42.3)
 the diagonally opposite corner of the vestibule a door opens
into the central courtyard. The vestibule is thus arranged to
form a bent entrance whereby the courtyard is practically
invisible from the street.

A barrel-vaulted recess (A), 0.36m wider than the
vestibule, opens north from it. Its arched opening is now partly
blocked by a later wall (see plate 42.3). This recess, like other
chambers in the northern part of the madrasa, has an angled
back wall following the alignment of the street. Beside the
entrance doorway, a door in the east wall of the vestibule (plate
42.4), leads into a long corridor that runs south within the east
boundary wall of the madrasa. It was (poorly) lit by a slit
window (now blocked) in that east wall. In the south wall of the
vestibule a door opens into a cell (B) on the east side of the
courtyard.

The courtyard, now cluttered with shanties (plate 42.11),
is enclosed on the east, west and north sides by a series of cross-
vaulted cells and by a cross-vaulted iwdn opening on the south
side. The two cells (B and C) on the east side, each lit by a high-
level slit window, have been conjoined by the removal of the
common wall. In the process, the door of ‘B’ has been converted
into a window. On the west side of the courtyard four doors and
four high-level slit windows open into three cells (G-I) and a
porch leading to the west annex (see below). Here also two
cells (G and H) have been combined and the redundant door
(of H) converted into a window. At the north end of the
courtyard are three doors surmounted by slit windows. The
two eastern doors open into two cells (L and M), and the
western one leads into a passageway giving access to two cells
to the west (J and K) and a tiny cubicle to the north. The south
wall of cell J) has been breached at some time to link that cell
with the adjoining cell (1) to the south.

The upper part of the courtyard walls has been rebuilt on
all sides, where later structures have been added on the roofs
of the cells. The only unencumbered roof is on the west side
above the porch and cell ‘G’. Here the masonry is intact and
includes a simple splay-face cornice which must originally have
continued round the east, west and north sides.

The ivan at the south end of the courtyard rises about two
metres higher than the cells on either side. Its pointed frontal
arch springs from muqarnas imposts, carved slightly
differently on either side (plates 42.5 and 42.6). The top of the
arch has been rebuilt with new voussoirs, but the lower part
survives on both sides, where a bold quirked ogee moulding
frames the extrados (see plate 42.7).
 The handsome miéhrab (plate 42.8) in the middle of the
rear, gibla wall has been clumsily repaired and the fine details
are obscured by several coats of paint. Nonetheless the original
form remains discernible (fig. 42.4). A quirked ogee moulding
frames a rectangular panel of red and cream-coloured ablaq
masonry containing the pointed-arched niche, which is flanked
by nook-shafts with re-used Crusader bases and capitals. The
arch is built of ablaq voussoirs which extend inwards and
downwards to an arch-shaped hub at the centre of the conch.
Much of this stonework is now missing, and several voussoirs in
the arch have been replaced. The second course of stones
above the mibrdb is slightly recessed between elaborately
modelled terminals as if to receive an inscription that was never
carved . The upper part of the wall, above the frame moulding,
has been hewn away to provide a ledge where pigeons nest.

In the east wall of the zvdn two doors open into two small
cells, one (E) barrel-vaulted and one (D) cross-vaulted like the
others. A recess in the east wall of ‘E’ opens into the corridor
from the entrance vestibule. There are various irregularities in
the masonry at this end of the corridor which, though difficult
to see clearly for piles of debris and old newspapers
(containing nests of rats), do suggest that this opening is a later
breach. A change in the vaulting of the corridor (see plan, fig.
42.3) seems to indicate that it originally extended only as far as
cell ‘D’ where a door (now otherwise not identifiable) opened
in the east wall of that cell. Why the builders should have
provided such an independent access to cell ‘D’ is not known:
it is a very unusual feature.’

Opposite the two doors in the east wall of the zvdn a door
and a window open into a room (F) on the west side, which is
roofed by two cross vaults. Above this room is an upper-floor
chamber with a window opening under the vault of the ivan
(see plate 42.9). This upper room, inaccessible to us, was
reached from the west annex.

The cross-vaulted porch at the south-west corner of the
courtyard is entered by a plain door indistinguishable from
those of the cells. Inside, there is a door in its south wall to
room 'F’, At the west end the porch opens through a wide
archway to a small yard around which the components of the
west annex are disposed. To the south a door and a window
open into a chamber (N) that we were unable to enter. To the
west two doors open into two small rooms (O and P). The first
of these (O) was also inaccessible to us. The other (P) now
contains a privy. These two small rooms are situated under an
open stairway which rises against the north and west sides of
 the yard to give access to the roof of the madrasa and the upper
floor room on the west side of the zvdin.

A modern doorway has been pierced in the yard’s north
boundary wall, at the bottom of the stairway. This doorway
leads into a larger yard, presumably a modern creation,
enclosed by the west wall of the madrasa and by two free-
standing walls to the north and west. It is reached from the
street by a modern door in the north wall. Another two modern
doorways, with slightly projecting stone frames similar in detail
to the doorway at the foot of the stairs, have been made in the
 west wall of the madrasa to give independent access to cells ‘T
and ‘kK’. These doorways will have been built relatively recently
when the building was converted into three separate dwellings.
Two little marble basins beside the west wall of the main
courtyard of the madrasa (plate 42.10), both apparently part of
the original Mamlik fabric, may have drained water from the
surface of the courtyard into a cistern, from which water could
be drawn at a well-head at the base of the southern abutment of
the archway from the porch to the west annex. The present
well-head is modern but it probably replaces an earlier one.

19 It is tempting to suppose that it was designed for some obscure Hanbali
custom or ritual, but it is not even clear that the Hanbaliyya was intended for
adherents of the Hanbali rite. The only known teacher in the madrasa in the
Mamluk period was in fact a Shafi'i (see above, p. 438). Indeed, Mujir al-Din,
himself a Hanbali, observes wistfully that there were no Hanbalis inJerusalem for
many years until a new Hanbali imam was appointed in 890/1485 (Mujrr, 384).
However, he subsequently lists several notable representatives of Hanbalism in
Jerusalem in the eighth/fourteenth and nintl/fifteenth centuries (Mujir, 592-602).

","The site is bounded by the Haram wall to the east, by the
‘Uthmaniyya (no. 57) and part of the Siqaya of al-‘Adil (589/
1193) to the north, by an open space to the west and by the Ribat
of Tankiz (above, p. 240) and the outer porch of the Bab al-
Silsila/Bab al-Sakina to the south. There is no street facade as
such and only the west frontage (plate 43.1) is unencumbered
by adjoining structures.
 Access to the building is gained from the south by a small
door (marked ‘a’ on the plan, fig. 43.3) under the outer porch
at Bab al-Sakina,' which leads through a small vestibule and a
dark corridor into a large open courtyard. All the major
components of the building were originally accessible only
from the courtyard. These comprise three zwéms and probably
originally a fourth arranged axially to open in the middle of
each side of the courtyard, and various other rooms of widely
differing sizes, some at mezzanine level, that occupy the
corners between the iwéins. The south-east corner room seems
to have been intended to house the grave of the founder; we
shall refer to it as the tomb chamber. (The south-west corner of
the building is now sealed off and inaccessible.) A mibrab
occupies the centre of the gibla wall of the south wan.

The masonry of the walls is far from homogeneous.
Towards the tops of walls and elsewhere small and roughly
dressed stones betoken later rebuilding, quite extensive in
places. In certain areas the lowest courses of masonry are very
 large, which suggests that parts of the building were erected on
the remains of some earlier structure.

The site is set back from the street, Tariq Bab al-Silsila,
separated from it by earlier buildings, and lies to the north of
the great arch (‘Wilson’s Arch’) that supports the east end of that
street. The ground level here is many metres below the level of
the street. Therefore a very substantial substructure is
necessary to support the floors of the Baladiyya, which are at
street level. The expense of constructing such a substructure
together with the absence of opportunity to erect a decorative
street facade might well have militated against the development
of the site until Mamlik times when tombs at the Haram
borders had become sought-after, and towards the end of the
eighth/fourteenth century when more easily developed sites
had already been taken. Thus the Baladiyya is quite likely to
have been built on a previously undeveloped site. For
confirmation of this hypothesis it would be necessary to inspect
the substructure. This has not been possible, though excavation
— or more correctly, clearance — of the substructure was
recently completed under the auspices of Israel’s Ministry for
Religious Affairs. No plans of the cleared substructures to the
north of Wilson’s Arch have been published. The only clue to
their form is a brief description published in 1983:

A little to the north of Wilson’s Arch, close by the [Haram’s
west] wall, the Crusaders planned a large structure in the
shape of a cross. It is possible that their intention was to
erect a large church on the entrance to the Temple Mount
and on the Western Wall. They sunk very solid foundations
between which a large free area was left. This area was
used for a huge water cistern. The foundation walls were
plastered with water-resistant plaster and the cistern
which was created was also in the shape of a cross. Above
the cistern at today’s street level, the church, or whatever
the building was meant to be, was to be built. However, it
was never built.”

Now the plan of the Baladiyya is cross-shaped (fig. 43.3),
following the fashionable four-zvan plan of the period, and it
seems to be more than a coincidence that that substructure is
also cross-shaped. The association of the substructure with a
Crusader church is, so far as one can tell, based on its cross
shape, which was, however, not a common form for Crusader
churches. It remains to be established whether or not the walls
of the cruciform substructure do coincide with the walls of the
Baladiyya, but if they do we should have reason to suppose that
 the substructure was built specifically to support this Mamluk
madrasa.

An alternative hypothesis, as suggested in the quotation
above, is that the cross-shaped foundations belonged to some
earlier building and were simply taken over by the builders of
the Baladiyya, who adapted their plan to suit these foundations.
This hypothesis, if correct, would explain the existence in
places, particularly along the south and west boundary walls, of
 the very large stones in the lowest masonry courses, and might
also explain the unusually large area occupied by the building,
with a courtyard that was too large (13.20 x 12.95m) to be
spanned in the customary fashion by a folded cross vault,
making this the only four-iva madrasa in Jerusalem with an
open courtyard.?

In any case, it appears that the original entrance to the
building was 3.23m to the north of the present entrance at the
 point marked ‘b’ on the plan (fig. 43.3), where the wall has
been roughly breached (plate 43.6). That wall, running
westward from the west wall of the Haram, seems to pre-date
the construction of the Baladiyya. It may be associated with the
construction of the Ayyubid outer porch at Bab al-Silsila/Bab al-
Sakina or perhaps some earlier development; it appears to
follow the line of the north end of Wilson’s Arch.
 "
44,"Ill HISTORY
","ALAEINE LEI OLE LOA
In a short notice Mujir al-Din places the Baladiyya Madrasa ‘at
the Bab al-Sakina near the Bab al-Silsila (the Chain Gate)’,/ and
al-Suyati has the following passing mention:

... the Bab al-Sakina, which is the gate adjacent to the door
of the madrasa known as the Baladiyya, the latter now
having the Ashrafiyya Madrasa as its northern (ic)
neighbour.®

An inscription which is sited over a small doorway near the Bab
al-Sakina gives positive identification. This inscription refers
only to a mausoleum (turba), but the ample remains of the
cruciform complex with a large open courtyard more than
explain the frequent appellation ‘madrasa’.

In a sijill entry dated 953/1547 the Baladiyya mausoleum
appears as the north boundary of the residence over the twin
gates of the Haram, and access to the house was said to be ‘via
the Baladiyya Madrasa (sic)’.

DATE

No literary or archival source known to us preserves either the
date of the construction or the date of the endowment. The text
of the funerary inscription is as follows.’

In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate. This
is the mausoleum of his late Excellency, Sayf al-Din
Manklibugha al-Ahmadi, Governor of the Province of
Aleppo (may God Almighty encompass him with His
mercy). He died there in Jumada II of the year seven
hundred and eighty-two [September 1380]

This tells us little, especially as there seems to be some
doubt about where he was actually buried. The inscription
could have been added toa building built well before his death
or added to one only completed after his death. One may
speculate that he embarked upon the Baladiyya when for a
short while in late 780/early 1379 he found himself in
Damascus with bartal status.

FOUNDER
Manklibugha was born in the early 740s/c.1340.° His initial
mamluk career was passed in Cairo. Ibn Taghribirdi writes of
‘several positions in Egypt’, but only that of intendant of the
Buttery is expressly mentioned, which he lost in 774/1372
when he was advanced to the highest rank of amir.!° During the
following years his career kept him in the Syrian provinces.
There are discrepancies in the recorded dating and course of
his frequent changes of governorship. He held posts in Kerak,
Hama, Safad, twice — possibly three times — in Tripoli, and twice
in Aleppo. Another Manklibugha, a mamlik of al-Nasir Hasan,
who served as governor in Aleppo and Damascus, built a
mosque in the former and died in 774/1 372, has been confused
with the founder of the Baladiyya, but he was called al-Shamsi.!!
Our Manklibugha in the extant inscription is called al-Ahmadi.
No explanation for this misba is given anywhere. The literary
sources as often as not call him al-Baladi, from which derives
the name of his foundation. Since some importation of
mamluks in the mid-fourteenth century was associated with
merchants from Mosul, could it be that the nisba al-Baladi
records his own or his importer’s connection with Balad in the
Mosul area?

Ibn Taghribirdi speaks of him as ‘one of the grand amirs,
whose days were long in Prosperity’, but, even though many of
 his changes of office and his one or two periods of
imprisonment were a reflection of the shifting patterns of
power and influence in the capital, connected with the fall of al-
Ashraf Sha‘ban and the rise to power of Barquq, he seems to
have been a compliant member of the hierarchy. Ibn
Taghribirdi suggests that he was above all interested in
maintaining his own position. However, he does quote a saying
of Manklibugha’s, that no amir is a true amir unless the expense
of his common table is half his fief income, and that after having
described him as ‘generous and perfect in chivalry’.

A month or so after returning for the second time to the
post of governor in Aleppo he died (Jumada II 782/September
1380).'° There is broad agreement in the sources concerning
this. Ibn Taghribirdi, with some precision as regards location,
adds that he was buried there too.'4 Van Berchem complicates
the matter quite unnecessarily by understanding that Mujir al-
Din was referring to the mausoleum in Jerusalem, when he
wrote that Manklibugha ‘died, and was buried in it.’ Ifin the text
of the inscription, ‘He died there (lit. in it)’, the pronoun can
refer to ‘the province of Aleppo (al-mamlaka al-Halabiyya),,
why is it any more difficult for the pronoun in Mujir al-Din’s
text to refer to Aleppo (Halab)? Mujir al-Din would then be
quite happily in conformity with the inscription and the extra
information in Ibn Taghribirdi. What is more, the historian Ibn
Khatib al-Nasiriyya, who as a youngster had seen Manklibugha
in Aleppo, also witnessed his funeral cortége there, and adds,
‘He was buried in a small tomb chamber (turba) of his outside
the Bab al-Maqam, near the Jawhari. After a good many years I
heard that he was disinterred and taken to Damascus (God
Almighty have mercy on him)’. All van Berchem’s difficulties
stemmed from his belief, for which he produced no evidence,
that Manklibugha was actually buried in Jerusalem. In the light
of the literary evidence, one must doubt whether. the
anepigraphic cenotaph in a room of the Baladiyya marks the
grave of Manklibugha.'° What one should be noting is the
setting-up of an inscription on a building, proclaiming it the
mausoleum of a person who seems to have been buried
elsewhere.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

In a chamber on the east side of the Baladiyya, which would
have originally looked: out on to the Haram before the
construction of the Ashrafiyya, are buried three members of
one family, the Amir Qunugbay al-Ahmadi and two daughters.
The surviving inscriptions date their deaths to Dhit’l-Hijja 797/
October 1395.'7 One wonders in passing whether it is purely
fortuitous that this amir has the same nisba as Manklibugha.

Mujir al-Din mentions a mysterious incident, quite
without sufficient explanation, in which a Hanafi Qadi of
Jerusalem at the very end of the fourteenth century died along
with another person, after they had been given poisoned drinks
in the Baladiyya Madrasa.!®

There is nothing but a fleeting mention of the Baladiyya in
Defter no. 522.” Possibly this is owing to the fact that the waqf
lands were located in Egypt, as Asali discovered from a later
sijill entry, where according to him land in the village of Kawm
al-Tujjar and the whole village of Harasta are named as
endowments of the Baladiyya.2°

For the years 946-47/1539-41 the waqfs of the madrasa

Patas, including two items for ‘taking rubbish from the
 madrasa’ and ‘clearing the madrasa of rubbish and earth’. The
grand total was 4,047 paras, 86 short of the total according to the
sijill.

The Shaykh Muhammad al-Khalili came to Jerusalem at
the end of the seventeenth century, in 1104/1692-93, and took
up residence in the Baladiyya Madrasa.” There is no clear
statement that he taught in the madrasa, but his wagfiyya
specified that his very extensive library ‘should remain under
the control of the waqf beneficiaries [essentially his male
descendants] in the Baladiyya Madrasa, for such time as they
themselves remain in it. If they move from it, the books should
remain under the control of the inspector in his house,
wherever that might be’.”4 Amongst the real estate that formed
al-Khalil1’s waqf was a ‘free space (kbuliiw) in the the Baladiyya
Madrasa’, which produced in rent 1,261 piastres and 22
Egyptian paras. Excluded from the waqf were two tabaqas
(living accommodation) over the madrasa, one of which was
already completed and given to his son Muhammad al-Salih as
his own property, and the other yet to be built and given to his
other son, Yusuf.” It is interesting that the Shaykh stipulated
that ‘any of the benefactor’s daughters or the daughters of any
of the beneficiaries of the waqf, who may be widowed and in
need of accommodation, may reside in the madrasa in the “free
space”.° He himself was buried in the madrasa in 1147/1734.”

It is easy to understand that the madrasa passed into the
private ownership of al-Khalili’s family, and then into the hands
of the Tarjuman family, descendants of al-Khalili on the female
side. It was sold to the Awqaf Administration, and now a part of
it has been incorporated with part of the Ashrafiyya to house the
Aqsa Library. The rest of the madrasa provides homes for
several families.”°

44,"IV ARCHITECTURE
",
44,"GROUND FLOOR (plan, fig. 43.3)
","eet Te ne, ee, ee ar ee. ae eae

(i) Entrance

The present entrance is by way of a small pointed-arched
doorway (a) in the north wall of the porch at Bab al-Sakina
(plate 43.2). That wall seems to have been built not earlier than
the construction of the initial Ashrafiyya (see below, p. 591), for
above the doorway there are three windows surmounted by an
inscription (possibly not im situ) belonging to that
construction, dated 875/1470. The wall blocks a tall arched
recess in the Bab al-Sakina porch. The masonry of doorway ‘a’
does not course through with the adjoining masonry (see plate
 43.3), suggesting that the doorway is in secondary use. The
plaque bearing the funerary inscription directly over the door
(above, p. 446) also does not course through, and it too appears
not to be in its proper place. Two slit windows on either side of
the inscription admit light to a vestibule within the doorway.

Aplain door in the west wall of the vestibule leads into two
small, dark chambers (once lit by a window to the south, now
blocked, visible in plate 43.2) in which the northern pier of the
Bab al-Sakina porch is discernible (see plan, fig. 43.3).

North of the vestibule is the breach ‘b’ in the earlier wall
where the original doorway, possibly surmounted by the
funerary inscription might have been (see above, p. 446).
Immediately beyond the breach there is a cramped space with
openings in each side. On the right-hand (east) side a narrow
winding staircase (plate 43.4) rises against the west wall of the
Haram to give access to the south-west corner mezzanine (see
below) and to the roof where the Ashrafiyya (no. 63) now
stands. On the north side is a window (formerly grilled) into
the tomb chamber. Persons entering and leaving the madrasa
must pass this window. It is set in a panel of red and cream-
coloured ablaq masonry enclosed by a quirked-ogee frame
moulding (plate 43.5). The sill has at some time been lowered,
the lintel replaced by a lop-sided segmental arch, and the right-
hand jamb rebuilt in plain stonework to form a doorway into
the tomb chamber. To the left of the window a cross-vaulted
corridor runs a few metres westward before turning north
between the tomb chamber and the south iwdm to lead into the
south-east corner of the courtyard (plates 43.6-43.7).

(ii) Courtyard

The courtyard is now cluttered with a variety of outhouses,
some built of stone and some modern ones built of concrete
(plate 43.8). Fig. 43.6 shows that the floor of the east Zwén is
lower than the west zwéin and the courtyard. This is because the
east zwvan retains its original floor while that of the west zvan
and the pavement of the courtyard have been raised at some
time. The floor of the south zvdn has also been re-paved. All the
pointed-arched openings into the zwans have been blocked up
to provide domestic accommodation. Otherwise the iwéds
remain largely intact except for the northern one, of which only
a vaulting springer remains.

(iii) South iwan (plate 43.12)

The south, gibla iwan is the largest. Its frontal arch (7.02m
wide) does not open for the full width of the van (10.38m),
evidently in order to present a frontage to the courtyard that
was more or less symmetrical with the other three The archec
 Plate 43.12 South 7w4n, from courtyard

of the east and west iwéms are respectively 6.88m and 6.80m
wide.

The lowest masonry courses of the east and west side walls
of this twan (plates 43.9 and 43.10) and of the responds
carrying the frontal arch are mostly of very large stones,
conceivably remnants of some earlier structure (see above, p.
446). An apparent opening in that large masonry in the east wall
(plate 43.9) has been partly blocked up to leave a doorway into
the entrance corridor. A similar opening in the west wall,
directly opposite the one in the east wall, is completely blocked
(plate 43.10). On the left side of that Opening in the west walla
wide crack, visible in plate 43.10, indicates major subsidence,
perhaps provoked by an earthquake.

An unusually large mibrab, 4.60m high, occupies the
middle of the gibla wall of the south ivan (plate 43.11). It is
flanked by a limestone column on either side, each resting on
a moulded base supported by a plain plinth. The capitals are so
badly eroded that it is no longer possible to determine their
original form. The columns are set in recesses 0.35m deep and
carry an outer arch around the inner arch of the recess (plate
43.11). The two lowest voussoirs of the inner arch have
irregular cavities roughly cut into them just above the
springers, apparently for the purpose of anchoring a beam
from which a lamp might have been hung. About 1.50m above
the mibrab is a small blocked Opening, presumably a window,
under the crown of the vault.

(iv) East iwén and adjoining rooms

The east zvdn, now accessible only from the majma‘ of the
Ashrafiyya (see below, p. 593), has a window (now a door) in its
rear wall, which is the west wall of the Haram, and a door in
each of its side walls. The door in its north side leads into a
Square chamber (A) roofed by a folded cross vault and lit bya
grilled window in the east (Haram) wall. In the centre of the
chamber a gabled timber frame draped with green baize (plate
43.13) covers three cenotaphs, two of which have tombstones
marking the graves of the Amir Qunuqbay al-Ahmadi and his
daughters, Safar and Zahra, who died in 797/1395.”? The
circumstances leading to the burial of Qunugbay and his two
daughters in the Baladiyya are unknown. Since the chamber is
vaulted, not domed, it seems unlikely that it was originally
intended for a tomb chamber.*”

On the other hand, the chamber to the south of the east
iwan is likely to have been intended to house the grave of the
 founder. It is rectangular in plan but recesses in all four sides
reduce the central area to a square, presumably in order to
support a dome. No dome survives, however — it may have been
dismantled to clear space on the roof for the construction of the
Ashrafiyya — and this part of the chamber is now cross-vaulted.
This chamber is in a good location for a tomb: close to one of
the most important Haram gates, with a window opening south
towards the Bab al-Sakina, and another opening east which,
before the construction of the Ashrafiyya staircase, looked out
on the Haram. The latter window is placed off centre in the east
wall, suggesting that some earlier opening may have existed
here when the Baladiyya was built. The present window is,
however, Mamluk. It is grilled, has ablaq facings ( plate 63.8)
and has recesses on each side of the embrasure to allow
shutters to fold away flush. The openings in the other walls,
including a blind one (now blocked up) in the west wall, are all
placed centrally. Though the tomb chamber never housed the
grave of the founder, it does contain a low, gable-ended,
plastered cenotaph that must mark the grave of Shaykh
Muhammad al-Khalili who was buried ‘in the Baladiyya’ in
1147/1734 (above, p. 447). The pointed-arched recesses in each
side of the chamber rise almost the full height of the vault. The
deepest one, on the north side, has had a secondary vault
inserted into it to support a later entresol (not shown on the
plan of the original mezzanines, fig. 43.4) which is reached
from the courtyard by a modern staircase.

(v) West iwan

The west iwdain is cross-vaulted like the others. It has undergone
various changes including the rebuilding of much of the right-
hand side of its frontal arch with a double row of voussoirs
(plate 43.14), partly supported by the wall that now blocks the
arch. The double window in the rear (west) wall appears to be
a later insertion. A shaft attached to the wall blocking the arch
allows water to be drawn from the cistern underneath to a
relatively modern well-head on the roof.

(vi) North iwan

Of the presumed north wan little survives except for a vaulting
springer (c) at the north-east corner of the chamber ‘B’ which
now stands in its place. No trace of a frontal arch exists, and the
vault has been completely rebuilt, so it is only the vestige of an
earlier vault at ‘c’, the presence ofa cruciform substructure, and
the likelihood of a symmetrical four-iwdn layout (as was
fashionable at the time of construction) that indicate that there
 originally was an iwdan on the north side of the courtyard.
(vii) Corner chambers

In the corners of the building between the iwans there are
various chambers. The two on each side of the east iwan have
been described in (iv) above. To the north of the west 7wdn is
a large, cross-vaulted room (C). A similar room may occupy the
south-west corner of the building, west of the south twan, but
this area was inaccessible to us.*"" A short barrel-vaulted passage
(D) between this area and the west iwan may once have
provided access to that room.

Besides these larger rooms there are smaller ones in the
 north-west and north-east corners of the building. At the north-
west corner a passage (E) leads north to a staircase up toa
mezzanine floor and, alongside the staircase, a window
overlooking the Siqaya of al-‘Adil to the north, where are now
the main public latrines. Next to that window a second passage
(F) extends westward past a blocked door (which appears to
have opened south into room ‘C’) toa tiny chamber, ‘G’, which
has a window in its north wall and traces of a terracotta pipe
against its west wall. This pipe might have drained water from
the roof to the cistern below.

At the north-east corner of the courtyard another passage
 (11) 1€ads tO a SlairCase tO a MEZZaNiNne ADOVE (See DELOW) and,
beyond that, a series of very small rooms (I-L). The floors of
these rooms are covered by an accumulation of debris (plates
43.15 and 43.16). Since none of them has any provision for
natural lighting or ventilation they are quite uncomfortable. It
is hard to imagine what their original purpose might have been.
Traces of terracotta pipes in the western (1) and eastern (L)
chambers indicate further drainage into the cistern from the
roof, and a square opening in the ceiling of a recess in the north
wall of room ‘ might once have provided some form of
ventilation. What lay to the north before the ‘Uthmaniyya (no.
57) was built is not known. A recent breach in the north wall of
room ‘K’ (plate 43.17) opens through the back of a mibrab
constructed of black and cream-coloured ablaq masonry in the
lower mosque of the ‘Uthmaniyya (see below, p. 550). It is
possible to stand upright in the mibrab itself but not to enter
the mosque since a new reinforced concrete wall has
completely blocked off the mihrab from that side. The lower
mosque of the ‘UthmAaniyya is now quite inaccessible and this is
the only evidence we have of its mibrab.

ORES Cn er a EN aL
 As with the zwédms, the entrance to these groups of corner
rooms are arranged more or less symmetrically in plan. The
ones in the north and west sides are, except for later
modifications, quite symmetrical, and a blind recess at the
north end of the east wall (plate 43.18) echoes the recess at the
north end of the west wall (plate 43.14), which is the entrance
to room ‘C’. It is possible that these entrances were originally
arranged symmetrically also in elevation but there are too
many later obstructions and alterations to be sure. Most of the
alterations are to the north end of the building, which seems to
have suffered considerable damage at some time, perhaps
during the same earthquake that destroyed much of the
Ashrafiyya. An incomplete billet cornice around the walls of the
courtyard (see plates 43.14 and 43.19) is probably a later
 embellishment added perhaps when these alterations were
made.**

MEZZANINES (plan, fig. 43.4)
There are mezzanines in all four corners of the building. The
one in the north-west corner sits directly over passage ‘E’ and is
reached by a staircase from that passage. It has a rectangular
window surmounted by a ventilation slit in its south wall (see
plate 43.14). The vault supporting the mezzanine floor has
collapsed in several places and has been replaced by a
reinforced concrete slab, said by the present tenant of the
adjoining room to have been laid in about 1970.

The south-west corner mezzanine is now reached by a
modern external stairway that rises across the blocked opening
 of the west iwdn. There is no trace of an earlier stair,
presumably one once led up to the mezzanine from the
passage (D) below. The present door into the mezzanine (plate
43.20) is obviously modern, as is a double window in its west
wall.

The north-east mezzanine survives largely intact. It is
reached by way of a stair from the passage (H) below (see plate
43.21) and has a small window’? in its south wall (plate 43.22)
which originally overlooked the courtyard.

The largest mezzanine is in the south-east corner, over the
entrance corridor. It is now reached from the courtyard by the
same stair that serves the modern entresol in the north recess
of the tomb chamber (above, p. 449) but was originally reached
by means of the winding staircase next to the entrance (above,
p. 447). That original staircase led first into a small cross-vaulted
anteroom and from there west through a doorway (with a door
reveal in its north jamb only, not in its south jamb which is in
the pre-existing wall described above, p. 446) into the main
room. This long narrow room is roofed in three bays by a
central folded cross vault and two simple cross vaults (plate
43.23). Abarrel-vaulted ancillary chamber is reached through a
crude opening in the north wall of the main room (plate 43.24).
The floor level of that ancillary chamber is approximately
0.50m higher than that of the the main room. A small window
in its west wall overlooks the courtyard. The present entrance
door to the main room, which is alongside the entrance to the
ancillary chamber, probably replaces an earlier window; there
is no other window.

The anteroom at the head of the staircase now gives access
to a room over the vestibule within the main entrance; this
room (plate 43.25) appears to have been added not earlier than
875/1470 (above, p. 447).

1 The porch at Bab al-Sakina was filled with ‘modern’ buildings until their
removal in 1871 (C. Clermont-Ganneau, Archaeological Researches in Palestine
during the years 1873-1874, i, London, 1899, 129-31). Included among these
buildings was a sabil built for Sultan Qaytbay (Mujir, 661). An engraving by Finden
published in 1835 shows these buildings from the south-east, and Tipping’s
engraving (1851) shows them more clearly from the west — see Jerusalem in Old
Engravings and Illustrations, ed. E. Schiller, Jerusalem, 1977, 30, 96.

2 Meir Ben-Dov, Mordechai Naor, Zeev Aner, The Western Wall, Jerusalem,
1983, 57. It was near Bab al-Silsila that the Crusaders built a large church, St Giles,
from where the re-used sculpture in the Bab al-Silsila may originate: J. Folda,

History of the Crusades, general ed. K.M. Setton, iv, The Art and Architecture of the
Crusader States, ed. H.W. Hazard, Madison and London, 1977, 273. Folda suggests
that this cruciform substructure may belong to the church of St Giles.

31 When we first visited the site in 1979 a double window in the west wall of this
part of the building was open but iron bars and accumulations of debris
prevented access. By 1984 this window had been blocked up.

32 The earliest directly dated Mamluk examples of billet mouldings in Jerusalem
are not earlier than the second quarter of the ninth/fifteenth century. This type of
moulding became popular with Ottoman builders.

access to them from passage ‘H’ is blocked. The window was subsequently
blocked up in January 1980.

The building consists of a complex of vaulted chambers

 "
45,"Il HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

Our guide, as so often, is Mujir al-Din, who wrote, ‘The
Wafa'iyya Zawiya is in the Bab al-Nazir [Street] opposite the
Manjakiyya Madrasa.’ One should also remember that he is

here dealing with institutions directly adjoining the Haram to
the west.

FOUNDER

There is no clear indication of the identity of the founder of the
zawiya. What is known is that towards the end of the fourteenth
century a member of the Abi’l-Wafa’ family settled inJerusalem
and bought property there. Earlier, under Badr al-Din b.
Muhammad (d. 650/1252-53), the family had been centred in a
zawiya at Wadi al-Nusir (Valley of the Eagles), west of
Jerusalem,’ and then a branch had moved to the village of
Shurafat, led by his great-grandson, Da’tid (d. 701/1301-2).3 It
was in turn is great-grandson, Taj al-Din Muhammad, who
settled in Jerusalem in 782/1380-81.4 Two of his cousins were
the immediate beneficiaries of the Amir Manjak’s endowing the
family zawiya with the village of Shurafat>

Mujir al-Din wrote, ‘Above it [the Wafa’iyya Zawiya] is a
residence (dar), which belongs to it, which was known as the
house of the Shaykh Shihab al-Din b. al-Ha’im, then came to be
known as the house of the Aba ’|-Wafa’ family, because it was
where they lived. Formerly it had been called Mu‘awiya’s
house.” Perhaps this is the house that Taj al-Din Muhammad
bought in 782/1380-81, and this is the date after which one may
place the founding of the zawiya.

There was another zawiya in Jerusalem during the Mamlik
period, which was associated with the Wafa'iyya Sufi order,
namely, the Red Zawiya (al-Zdawiya al-Hamra’) near the
Salahiyya Khanqah. Mujir al-Din gives no details concerning
the founder or the date of the foundation,’ and there is nothing
 to connect it with the Wafa’iyya in the Bab al-Nazir street.
However, this points to a problem which faces one in dealing
with the latter foundation — when one meets with ‘al-Wafa’iyya’
in any source, does it refer to the zawiya of that name or more
generally to the Sifi order and its members present in
Jerusalem?

DATE

See the above section. Perhaps one will not be far wrong if the
date of foundation is placed in the penultimate decade of the
fourteenth century.®

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY
A son and two grandsons of Taj al-Din Muhammad are
recorded as shaykhs of the Wafa’iyya in Jerusalem (with the
possible ambiguity referred to above). They were Taqi al-Din
Abt Bakr (799-859/1397-1455),’ and Taj al-Din Muhammad b.
Abi Bakr (d. 891/1486)!° and Burhan al-Din Ibrahim b. ‘Ali (d.
874/1469-70).'' In the case of Muhammad b. Abi Bakr, one
source explicitly refers to him as ‘shaykh of the Wafa’iyya
Zawiya’.'* He was also shaykh of the Hasaniyya Madrasa on the
other side of the street. He followed his father, Aba Bakr, in
both positions. There was a Shams al-Din Muhammad b.
Ahmad b. Amin, who does not seem to have belonged to the
same family. He is described as ‘a Wafa’l Safi and a merchant’,
but in his case there is none of the ambiguity referred to above,
since he is clearly said to have been ‘shaykh of the Wafa’iyya
community (#@’ifa)’. He died in the year 896/1490.°

The zawiya was purchased by a leading Khalwati Sufi,
Mustafa al-Bakri, in the eighteenth century, and then passed
into the ownership of the Shaykh Muhammad b. Budayr. The
latter, in the year 1205/1790-91, made a waqf of ‘all the house
(dar), my present residence, which adjoins the Haram to the
west’, and particularly specified that the lower chamber
(kbalwa), which was to be a mosque (masjid), should also
contain his library, which he likewise constituted as a waqf.""4
The remains of this library were recently transferred to the
Library of the Aqsa Mosque, which is housed in the lower hall
of the Ashrafiyya.
 "
45,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","HARAM FRONTAGE (fig. 44.3)
About 7m south of Bab al-Nazir, in that part of the Haram wall

which later formed the east boundary of the Wafa’iyya, al-
‘Umari noted the window ofa hall that was a waqf of the Haram
 and at that time (c.745/1345) served as lodgings for the
superintendent of the Haram awqaf.> This window still exists,
the northernmost of five plain windows Opening on the Haram

from the Wafa’iyya. The southern four windows did not exist in
al-‘Umari’s time.

STREET FRONTAGE (plate 44.1)

The street frontage is three storeys high. The two lower storeys
belong to the Wafa’iyya and the house associated with it; the top
Storey is a later Ottoman addition (see plate 44.2). The
conjunction between the frontage of the Wafa’iyya and that of
Ribat al-Mansiri to the west shows that the ribat is posterior.
The masonry of the Wafa’iyya frontage is not homogeneous and
includes some stones with distinctive Crusader tooling and a
mason’s mark which appear to be in secondary use, indicating
 that the construction is probably post-Crusader, perhaps
Ayyubid. In the upper part of the wall four re-used stones bear
fragments of two Arabic inscriptions dating from the fourth/
tenth or fifth/eleventh century.""

There are few openings in this frontage: two windows
fitted with masbrabiyya screens in the upper storey (the left-
hand one surmounted by a slit window) and a rectangular
grilled window and a pointed-arched door with a slit window
above it in the lower storey.

INTERIOR (plan, fig. 44.3)

That door leads into a barrel-vaulted chamber which serves as
a vestibule from which two doors open, one east and one south.
The door to the east opens into another barrel-vaulted
chamber, lit by the grilled window in the street frontage. From
 the south door a short passage to the east admits to the north-
west corner of a long hall extending eastwards in three vaulted
bays up to the Haram wall, where it is lit by the window
observed by al-‘Umari. In the south side of the embrasure to
that window a deep recess in the thickness of the wall might
once have contained a staircase to the upper floor.

The western bay of the long hall opens southwards
through a cross-vaulted extension into a small open courtyard,
where a staircase against the west wall now serves the upper
floor. On the southern side of the yard an archway opens into
a barrel-vaulted room at the south-west corner of the zawiya.
The area to the west of these compartments is inaccessible
since four openings into it are blocked. To the east, between
these compartments forming the western and northern sides of
the zawiya and the Haram, the remainder of the ground floor
consists of six rooms in two parallel ranges. These rooms
against the Haram wall are lit by windows which were not seen
by al-‘Umari, suggesting that the rooms were constructed at
some time after 745/1345. The northernmost of these rooms
contains a large anonymous cenotaph. From the southernmost
pair of rooms two short passages lead south to two
interconnected barrel-vaulted chambers between these rooms
and the northern chamber of the Ribat of Kurt (see above, p.
148). The eastern of these barrel-vaulted chambers is lit by a
window in the Haram wall, not observed by al-‘Umari.

 BAB AL-NAZIR OUTER PORCH"" (plate 44.3)

As the plan (fig. 44.3) shows, Bab al-Nazir, as approached from
the street, is preceded by a square, cross-vaulted porch flanked
on the north and south sides by broad iwdan-like recesses. The
northern recess now contains the lower part of the modern
staircase to the Manjakiyya (above, p. 387); the southern one is
partly obstructed by a narrow stair built against the east wall to
serve the Ottoman buildings on the top floor of the Wafa’iyya.
The original extent of this southern Zvdn (dotted on the plan)
is shown by a straight joint visible in the east wall of the eastern
room confronting the street. A deep recess has been cut
through the rear wall of the zvén, evidently to help light the
long hall of the zawiya.

The date of construction of the porch is not known, though
its semicircular frontal arch suggests that it is early.
Conjunctions in the masonry of the street frontage show that it
certainly predates all parts of the Wafa’iyya, and there are
indications that the gate itself is Umayyad for, though its arched
opening was rebuilt in about 600/1204""* and an inner porch
added in 707/1307-8, traces remain of the springings of an
earlier semicircular arch that matches other Haram gates for
which an Umayyad date of construction has been postulated
(above, p. 45). The wooden doors were renewed in about 600/
1204, as an inscription on the door leaves records.!?
 by a Taqi al-Din Abt Bakr al-Wafa’i, but with no date and no specified purpose.
The property involved was a third of a plantation at Ramla and a quarter of a
vineyard (location unspecified).

46,"I LOCATION (fig. 45.1)
","This building of Amir Tashtamur al-‘Ala’l, which the Chronicler
of Jerusalem calls a turba or mausoleum,? and which the
inscription across the mausoleum facade calls simply a makdn,
place or establishment, is situated at the south side of Tariq Bab
al-Silsila, between the junctions of the Maydan Lane (bara) to

the west and Abii Madyan Stairway (‘agaba) a short distance to
the east.
 "
46,"Il SITE AND GENERAL LAYOUT (fig. 45.2)
","Cat ayer a

Buildings sited along Tariq Bab al-Silsila necessarily
participated in a particularly lively religious and social
ambiance in Mamliik times. The twin gate Bab al-Silsila/Bab al-
Sakina where it ends was long since the principal entrance to
the Haram, the wmdat abwdb al-masjid, as Mujir al-Din
formulates; and he observes that it was the one used most by
the people coming and going, because it leads to the city’s
highroad (al-shari‘ al-a‘zam) and to most of the markets and
other streets of the town? Topographically it is part of the
ancient east-west artery of Jerusalem, the only direct
connection between the citadel in the walls of the Upper City
and the holy precinct (see fig. 1), crossing the Valley to the
Haram on a massive ancient causeway. By the time of
Tashtamur’s arrival, late in the eighth/fourteenth century, the
section nearest to the Haram had gained a certain architectural
distinction: at least eight monumental buildings had been set
up there; with the exception of the first, all within the past eight
decades, the most distinguished being the madrasa/khanqgah
complex of Tankiz built adjacent to that gate (see fold-out plan,
fig. 14, at back of book). However, what will have been
especially important for Tashtamur’s choice of site was the fact
that the majority of these buildings either were mausoleums
(nos. 2, 28) or included mausoleums in a larger funerary
complex (nos. 11, 13, 29,36). There were six, which is a greater
number than the scattered few built previously at or near the
northern and western borders of the Haram (for probable
reason see below, p. 469); Tashtamur’s makan comprising his
turba was the seventh in Tarig Bab al-Silsila.

It was probably for reasons of space that he chose a site
that was further from the Haram than the others (fold-out plan,
Jig. 14). Indeed, nearer to the Bab al-Silsila, where the road runs
on top of the ancient causeway bridge, sites with a certain depth
(generally restricted to the northern border) had already been
largely occupied by the earlier funerary buildings. Tashtamur’s
site chosen at this particular distance and at the south side of
Tariq Bab al-Silsila had the possibility of expansion onto the
edge or lower reaches of the Upper City; and, moreover, rooms
 in the exposed rear part of the building had the advantage of
overlooking the south of the Haram precinct with the Aqsa
Mosque and its many holy places,‘ and when seen from the
Valley, part of the building would stand out as an identifiable
piece of property (hence, apparently, one of its rooms there
had its window decoratively emphasized externally, cf. below,
p. 471).

Two conditions of the site particularly affected the overall
configuration of Tashtamur’s building: the sloping contour of
the terrain and its being crowded with remains of ancient
buildings — both conditions typical for Jerusalem sites and
vividly depicted in Mujir al-Din’s account of what made the
Jerusalem architecture of his time so distinctive.° Since many of
the irregularities in the fabric and levels of this eighth/
fourteenth-century development are due to either of these
conditions, reference to them will occur throughout the
descriptive parts of this chapter.

GENERAL LAYOUT OF GROUND FLOOR (plan, fig. 45.3)
The northern part of the complex, adjacent to Tariq Bab al-
Silsila, is divided into two wings of equal width by siting the axis
of the vestibule ‘x1’ exactly on the centre-line. In the facade
elevation these wings are, however, of rather unequal
appearance according to the different functions they were
(originally) built for (fig. 45.7, plates 45.1, 45.2, 45.4). The left
(east) wing is built as a vaulted market unit with independently
accessible rubii‘ rooms above, very similar to the Siq al-
Qattanin, and apparently built before Tashtamur and acquired
by him. Only three bays with a shop and arubii ‘room above are
comprised in the Tashtamuriyya (perhaps there had been
more), the shops probably continuing in use here with their
original functions as an income bearing commercial unit,°
while the rooms above were made part of the second floor
development linked to the rear of this wing (cf. below, p. 471).
The vault is extended west across the principal entrance which
is sited between the two wings.’ The right (west) wing
accommodates mainly the domed tomb chamber or
mausoleum ‘a’; but it has at the corner of the facade a recess ‘c1’,
which is here considered as having originally been a sabil or
place for the free distribution of drinking water (cf. below, p.
470), and a small room ‘c2’ directly above, half projected on
cantilevered corbels (plan, fig. 45.4), may well have been a
kuttab (maktab al-aytam) or place for the teaching and care of
orphans (cf. below, p. 470).

In the rear, behind the hisher western wing and
 encroaching upon the area behind the lower eastern wing, is
the madrasa with a vaulted four-izvé hall ‘b’ as its monumental
core (plan, fig. 45.3). It is accessible from the principal
entrance, at Tariq Bab al-Silsila, through the vestibule ‘x1’
(which also leads to the mausoleum). Another way of access is
from the west entrance ‘y’ in the Maydan Lane, through
vestibule ‘yl’ which is accommodated between the north and
west iwdns. The other corner between the north and east
twans, ‘sunk’ to the level of the eastern wing, provides
communication to the latrine ‘L’ and room ‘el’ which has a well
and is partitioned off internally to serve as an ablution place
(mida’) for the madrasa. This well-room is at the lowest level of
a three-storeyed development in the rear of the lower east wing
(section, fig. 45.9) here called annex, because of architectural
evidence that ‘el’ existed before the Tashtamuriyya and was
simply incorporated or annexed and built upon (cf. below, p.
471).

Literary and architectural evidence together suggest that
Tashtamur came to live in Jerusalem and not only built his
turba, duly endowed with pious and charitable foundations,
but also established his residence at this very site in the middle
and upper floors which are considered here as the domestic
quarters and the reception area respectively.

MIDDLE FLOOR (plan, fig. 45.4)

The middle floor in the eastern part of the complex, here
considered as the residential quarters of the Amir’s household,
are still in domestic use and probably have always been, and
changes in structural make-up and ways of communication are
bound to have occurred in the six centuries of its existence, but
one aspect will not have changed substantially, namely , that it
extended on the one hand, from the middle floor ‘e2’ of the
annex into the upper corner rooms ‘e2” and ‘e2” of the four-
twan hall, which are not (or not properly) accessible from
inside the madrasa. and on the other hand, into the rzzbii‘
 rooms ‘d2’ above the shops. In other words there will have
been a large area of loosely connected rooms and spaces with
recesses and landings on two slightly different levels — four to
five steps apart (section, fig. 45.9) — that would stretch from the
rubtt‘ rooms overlooking Tariq Bab al-Silsila in the north to the
largest room of this level in the south, which is also the one with
the view onto the Haram (plan, fig. 45.4).

It is in connection with this development in the eastern
part of the site that the remains of a tall portal ‘z1’ in the upper
reaches of Abt Madyan Stairway are here tentatively
considered as remains of the east entrance of Tashtamur’s
makan (fig. 45.2; and plate 45.6, where twelve courses of a left
portal jamb are visible, with its moulding turning right in the
twelfth course). There is a walled-up door ‘z’ in the now
largely concealed eastern boundary wall (plan, fig. 45.3), which
could well have once been connected by a passage to that
portal. Access to the middle floor would have been via stairs
accommodated, in all probability, in the room behind the
walled-up door ‘z2’ (whether or not this now inaccessible
room was at the same time provided with a connection to the
main street — through the angled extension in the central shop
seen in fig. 45.3 — remains to be investigated). In fact,
considering the domesticity assumed for this part of the
complex, it is hardly conceivable that the access from the great
principal portal was used — i.e. via the vestibule and stairs
beginning at a door adjacent to the entrance of the madrasa
(plan, fig. 45.3). These stairs continue to the middle floor (plan,
fig. 45.4) and lead to the reception hall or g@a@ on the roof court

(plan, fig. 45.5).

UPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 45.5)

The upper floor, developed around a roof court between the
dome of the mausoleum and the skylight of the madrasa hall,
with rooms and shallow iwdms, is here considered as the
Amir’s reception area. It identifies itself as such bv the presence
 of the qa a-type hall (described below, p. 473) which, on a
grander scale, was the core of any great amir’s palace in the
capital, including his own.’ Perched as it is above the street-
vault of Tariq Bab al-Silsila this gaa would, however, not have
attained a suitably large extent had the vault above the shops
not been extended across the great portal (section, fig. 45.7,
and below, p. 471).

There is a separate direct access to the roof court from the
west entrance ‘y’ in the Maydan Lane (elevation, fig. 45.11;
plans, figs. 45.3, 45.4 and 45.5), via stairs that do not pass by any
domestic quarters, unlike the stairs in the eastern part.

Thus much on the scope and composite nature of
Tashtamutr’s establishment.
 "
46,"Ill HISTORY
","FOUNDER
The historians and chroniclers of the Mamlak period tend to
 refer to Tashtamur al-‘Ala’i as the dawddar, since it was as First
Secretary of State or Great Dawadar of Sultan Sha‘ban that he
had come to exercise considerable influence on government
affairs. It was for the first time under that sultan, al-Maqrizi
States, that dawdddars were given power almost equal to
viceroys, issuing royal orders without consultation, and he
refers expressly to Tashtamur,'° who held that position for the
last six years of Sha‘ban’s rule (Jumada 1 772 to Dhiv’1-Qa‘da 778/
November-December 1370 to March 1377).'! He was about two
decades senior to Sultan Sha‘ban,'? and his authority is perhaps
best reflected in the angry remark reported of the Sultan when,
on the road to Mecca, he was advised by Tashtamur to take
action in view of the revolt that was on the verge of breaking
Out: ‘You order me about (tahkum ‘alaiya) in Cairo, and now
here too!’ However, Tashtamur did not always have strained
relations with the Sultan, for we read that some years earlier (in
775/1373) Sha‘ban took his ailing mother to the garden
mansion (manzara) of Tashtamur on Rawda Island, staying
 there two days in company with all the amirs,'* among them
certainly the Grand Amir who was her husband. After the revolt
that led to Sultan Sha‘ban’s assassination, Tashtamur took
command, and cancelling the pilgrimage he led the return to
Cairo. Attacked and defeated by the rival party he was briefly
imprisoned and then removed to Syria but nonetheless given a
high position as governor of the province.’ There he quickly
became leader of the amirs discontented with the new
situation, and their pressure contributed to a change in power
structure at court. Within halfa year Tashtamur was called back
to the capital, made Commander General of the Egyptian Army
(atabak al- asakir),'° and assigned residence in the palace of
Qawsiin,’” one of the grandest palaces in Mamluk Cairo where
the highest-placed amirs tended to reside. He did not last long
in that privileged position, for under the nominal rule of a
minor son of Sha‘ban the real power was in the hands of the
amirs Barqiq and Baraka, as Ibn Qadi Shuhba asserts. Thus, for
example, his request for the appointment of the learned jurist
Siraj al-Din al-Bulgini as Chief Qadi was overruled (the
previous holder of that post having resigned in disgust over the
amir’s making light of religious affairs).'? Apparently,
Tashtamur had long-standing good relations with al-Bulgini
since the time he was dawdd4r to Sha‘ban, for we read that he
had him conduct a scholarly disputation at his house in 776/
1375.”° It will have been his systematic way of handling things
 that irritated Barqigq, Ibn Taghribirdi judges,”’ which thus
brought about his downfall. In the eyes of this historian
Tashtamur was the ideal administrator whose good offices,
absence of greed and excellent handling of state affairs had
brought stability and prosperity to people’s affairs, until he was
arrested and Barqig and Baraka took over, doing things which
lastingly undermined the order of the Mamlik state.”* Indeed,
Barqiq, having married Tashtamur’s daughter, contrived
intrigues that led to the arrest of Tashtamur in Dhi’l-Hijja 779/
April 1378.

Appointed Commander General instead of his father-in-
law, Barqiq embarked on a ruthless policy of favouring
mamliks of his own Circassian race, and saw to it that
Tashtamur was given no chance of regaining influence on state
affairs. He had him first sent to prison in Alexandria, then into
confinement without office (battal) in Damietta, with a local fief
assigned as subsidy for himself and his family.7* Called back
into government service about two and a half years later,
Tashtamur was made governor of Safad,” far from any centre of
power. In that function he was ordered to join with his army
contingent in a military expedition against the Turcomans
which Barqigq and Baraka had planned some years before.”°
Eventually he resigned, not only from what must have been for
him a humiliating position, but from participation in power
politics altogether. He did so in Ramadan 784/November-
 Se To, ies Se eres sa igre ge ee

without office.” Ibn Qadi Shuhba implies that it was an illness
that had dictated such a move;”* however, this can only have
been a secondary reason: more important certainly was that by
retreating to Jerusalem Tashtamur would be relieved from an
active allegiance to the new Sultan — Barqiiq — who ascended
the throne on the 19th of that month/26 November 1382
(having deposed the (minor) son of Sha‘ban, as previously he
had rid himself of Baraka, his kbushddsh or comrade in
servitude and manumission with whom he had shared his rise
to power for so long).

If Ibn Qadi Shuhba, the only chronicler to speak of the
earlier years of Tashtamur, is right in stating that he had initially
been a mamltk and dawddar of Yalbugha al-Khassaki, the first
Atabek and regent-amir of Sultan Sha‘bain”? — and this seems to
be indirectly corroborated by others*’ — then our amir’s rather
passive attitude towards Barqiiq appears in a new light: both
had originally been purchased, trained and manumitted by the
same patron, with Barqiq being the somewhat younger of the
two kbushddashs. Generally this common experience in their
youth — in a country whose religion they had agreed to adopt,
but whose language they did not speak — generated in the
mamliiks a feeling of comradeship that lasted throughout life.*!
It will have been this loyalty that motivated Tashtamur, once
become Great Dawadar of the Sultan after Yalbugha’s revolt
and violent death, to make efforts gradually to bring back his
exiled mamliiks to Cairo,” among them Barqiq.*

His request being granted, Tashtamur lived in Jerusalem
for about two years without regaining his health @mutamarrid),
as Ibn Qadi Shuhba maintains, before he died in Sha‘ban 786/
September 1384,* just over fifty years of age.>> The obituary
notes in the chronicles lay stress on his quest for understanding
the religious sciences, his seeking the company of specialists in
Islamic law, ‘lama’ and fugaha’, whom he used to interrogate
Qujalisuhum wa-yusa'ilubum) and his association with men of
letters.*° Ibn Taghribirdi adds a somewhat lighter touch to the
picture of his personality in mentioning also an inclination to
learn poetry and listen to music.*”

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

The body of the founder was laid to rest in his domed tomb
chamber, but although the central cenotaph still survives, it
bears the inscription relevant to Tashtamur’s son, who was
made a tablkbdina amir in 791/1389.*

... This is the tomb of the servant needful of God Almighty,
the late Ibrahim, son of the late Tashtamur al-‘Ala’i. He
died [and passed] to the mercy of God Almighty on Friday,

2 Sha‘ban in the year 795 [13 June 1393].*?

His tomb is possibly the one in a corner of the chamber. The
tomb-stone was at some time transferred to the main tomb
which had lost its own inscription.

One or two entries in the Jerusalem sijills which refer to
the Tashtamuriyya in fact call it a madrasa. In 1020/1611 a
Shaykh Sharaf al-Din Yahya b. Muhammad b. Qadi al-Salt
converted several fruit plantations around Jerusalem into wagf
property to provide, among other purposes, a sum of money
from which the joint 2ézir and mutawaili of the Tashtamuriyya
Madrasa would pay 90 paras a year toa person for supplying the
fountain at the door of the madrasa with clean water
throughout the nine months of the three seasons of spring,
summer and autumn, and 45 paras for lighting each night a
lamp in the vault over the street to the west of the
Tashtamuriyya. The mdzir was to spend 45 paras annually on
the provision of oil for the lamp.*° The arrangements for the
supply of water suggest that the waqf of the Tashtamuriyya was
no longer fulfilling one part of the founder’s plan.

In the year 1093/1682 a group of men, described as the
mutawallis of the madrasa, requested permission to carry out
repairs which were estimated to cost 159 piastres. The details of
the work required by the dilapidated state of the building are
confusing, but concern the following features: the east wall of
 the madrasa overlooking the public way leading to the
Moroccans’ Quarter, the lower great chamber (bayt) next to the
east wall, the upper kitchen of the madrasa and the adjoining
room and latrine, the western wall of the madrasa, which
separates it from a house in private hands, the ‘upper small
zwan of the madrasa’, and the portico over the street. In
general, most of the rooms and the walls needed repair, as did
‘the rooms attached to the madrasa’.*!

A survey, dating from the end of the sixteenth century, of
offices and positions in the various institutions of Jerusalem,
together with the remuneration for each, mentions for the
Tashtamuriyya the combined post of shaykh and nazir, which
two persons held, one receiving 1 asper daily and the other
asper. Two men shared the farrdsh position, which merited 114
aspers daily, and three Koran readers shared 28 aspers each
month.” Asali has noted the appointment of the four sons of
Muhammad b. Qadi al-Salt to succeed him as ‘mudarris’ in
1046/1636-7.° One of them was called Yahya, presumably the
same person that made the waqf in 1020/1611 (see above).

TV ARCHITRCTIIRG
 "
46,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","There is no mention of Tashtamur’s building in Jerusalem,
except by Mujir al-Din: in listing the Turba Tashtamuriyya as an
endowment (waqf) of the Amir,“* he obviously refers not
merely to the tomb chamber or mausoleum proper, but to its
setting surrounded by pious and charitable services, since the
largest part of the perpetual funding would naturally be
designed for the people engaged for the administration,
performance and running of these services, from the teacher or
shaykh to the mat servant or cleaner — and there would
invariably have been one or more Koran readers.*®

As neither the original waqf deed, nor a later copy of it has
come down to us, there is only the architectural evidence to tell
the scope of this ‘rba or funerary complex, namely, that apart
from the domed tomb chamber at least a sabil, a kuttab and a
madrasa*® were included. The waqf documents would also
have specified the particular use of the various rooms to the
east of the turba and on its roof, together with the original ways
of communication, of which much has necessarily been altered
in the six centuries since Tashtamur’s death.

The structural fabric of the building and its decoration tell
of various compromises due to the limitations of either space
or finance, and one might add the pressure of time. For this is
what the combined literary and epigraphical evidence
suggests: if it was some time in Ramadan 784 that Tashtamur
had asked to be excused from his office and allowed to reside
in Jerusalem (possibly after Barqiq’s accession on the 19th),
and ifthe year 784 given in the inscription refers, as usual, to the
date of completion at least of the bulk of the structure, then
there could have been only three full months for its
construction. Apart from architectural evidence this time factor
is taken here as an additional argument for considering the
eastern parts of the complex (at the frontage and the rear) as
largely pre-existing. In other words, upon arrival in Jerusalem
Tashtamur would have acquired a building or two along this
prominent road, and will have only demolished and rebuilt as
much as was needed for the planned mausoleum-madrasa unit
and an appropriate entrance, making use also of existing
boundary walls; the other (eastern) parts were simply taken
over and made into a coherent residential area. Considering
that from the demolition much of the building material was
readily available on site, and considering the long tradition of
the local masons in building with stones of all sizes and
historical periods, there is every reason to accept that within
the three months Tashtamur’s makdn was largely completed,
including his reception hall or gaa on the vault across the
street.

There is, moreover, additional architectural evidence to
the effect that the monumental portal unit was installed
prefabricated, which would naturally have contributed
likewise to the speeding up of construction works. This
evidence mav he concidered firct
 PORTAL

It can be seen that the muqarnas portal was designed
independently of the rest of the layout, since it necessitated
various adjustments in the plan and elevation of the
surrounding structure. Had it been sited on the exact centre-
line of the frontage, like the axis of the vestibule (plan, fig. 45.3),
its frame moulding would have impinged on the width of the
adjacent shop recess (elevation, fig. 45.7, left). The portal itself
could not, of course, be made narrower, since its width was
linked to the geometry of the muqarnas (as shown in AG.
Walls’ analysis, fig. 45.12D) and to the width of the cantilevered
ashlar stones from which that was carved (fig. 45.12A). The
whole had therefore to be shifted in the other direction
(westwards) (plan, fig. 45.3), making the right jamb of the door,
at the centre of the recess, come flush with the vestibule wall
inside. Any further shift would have made the door too narrow
and would have impinged on the springing of the terminal arch
of the street vault (fig. 45.12A).

Even so further adjustments were necessary on the left
side of the portal (elevation, fig. 45.7) where the springer of the
street vault had to be moved to the left, thus reducing the bay
over the westernmost shop recess and causing the window of
the room above to be recentred. It is also worth noticing that
the frontal stones of the two upper tiers of the mugarnas hood
have been smoothed into a curve producing a trefoil outline
together with the frontal arch of the semidome above. One may
wonder why this decorative effect was left without the usual
emphasis of a moulding. This, together with the excessive
width of the portal, or its hood, not anticipated in the layout
plan, raises the question whether this portal may not originally
have been made for another building, whether or not actually
 installed there. In other words, had it been dismantled from
some other site or had it been acquired ready-made from a
builder’s yard? Considering Tashtamur’s eagerness to
complete the building with its foundation inscription before
the end of his year of arrival, either possibility would have
speeded up the work. The slight off-centredness of this
principal entrance is, however, of no consequence visually,
since there is no overall decorative scheme for the facade, still
less a symmetrical one as in the Turba Kilaniyya obliquely
across the road.

MAUSOLEUM
The mausoleum, the most important building unit of the
whole, was of course placed on the best part of the frontage, in
the higher west wing, which is also at the juncture of two urban
thoroughfares. The size of the tomb chamber is somewhat
larger than any other built on this street or elsewhere in
Jerusalem in Mamltk times. Made as large as possible in the
space available, it takes up almost the whole width of that wing,
except for a narrow strip bordering the Maydan Lane (plan, fig.
45.3). It is approximately square and is expanded on each side
into a high pointed-arched recess. The transition to the dome is
effected by means of two-faced pendentives spaced out to
support a twelve-sided string course and drum (plate 45.8 and
section, fig. 45.8); these show the remains of pairs of shallow
mugqarnas elements applied to the obtuse corners of that
dodecagonal course.*’ The dome rising from the drum has its
base marked by a rounded-off string course; it is in profile
slightly stilted and thus distinguished from the domes of purely
local tradition which are generally more squat.

There is a mibrab, soberly cut in large ashlar blocks in the
 south (qibla) wall (plate 45.7), to stress, as customary, that
although a memorial to a person, it was above all a place for the
worship of God — for orthodox Islam has always denounced
such commemoration as concealed idolatry. It is set between
two recesses of which the left (eastern) one was originally a
window opening to the madrasa, and so providing a physical
link with those pious studies of religious sciences of which the
founder, in establishing and endowing his tomb, has assured
the perpetual performance. Such architectural openings,
generally found in tomb chambers of the time, are an
indication of the ardent medieval belief in, and aspiration for,
that ‘baraka’ or beneficent divine influence, spiritual but felt
also as substantial, which emanated from acts of piety. And
since that was derived also from the blessings invoked by
passers-by on the tomb, those who, like Tashtamur, could
afford it would buy sites on prominent streets, where the
stream of passers-by was dense and continuous. Hence the
great popularity of this section of Tariq Bab al-Silsila as a site for
funerary monuments, even more so than sites along the
borders of the Haram, which was closed at night; and hence the
invariable practice of providing a tomb chamber with at least
one, preferably (as in Tashtamur’s), with two large grilled
windows opening on the street.

The sills of these windows are flush with the floor inside
 and as broad as the dome-bearing wall they were set in. Here
generally took place the supreme and most obvious of the acts
of piety from which ‘baraka’ was derived — readings by
professional readers of the Koran. It was certainly to honour
their worshipful task of spreading the word of God (for the
benefit of both those buried within and those passing outside)
that these window sills were especially enhanced with
decoration: here a patterned pavement of marble mosaic (in
black, two shades of brown, and white). The place is marked off
from the rest of the room by its own raised sill, composed of
two pieces of white marble with a reddish piece of marble
dovetailed in (note the trefoil shape of the joints in plate 45.12).

The tomb chamber is that part of the complex on which
most of the decorative effort was spent, within the means at
Tashtamur’s disposal. Thus its entrance was especially
embellished outside and inside: in the vestibule, the door
jambs were constructed in bichrome courses, the flat relieving
arch above the lintel given a curvilinear joggled inlay (now
painted over), and the whole was surrounded by a rectangular
frame moulding which ends on both sides ina curl (plate 45.9).
There is a bronze door knocker (plate 45.10). This entrance to
the mausoleum in the west wall of the vestibule was further
emphasized by a folded cross vault in the tunnel vault of the
vestibule (plan, fig. 45.3). Within, the arched recess of the door
 MAaMLUR JCTUSALETL

is capped by a radiating motive carved from stucco rather than
stone (plate 45.11).

Externally, in the principal facade (elevation, fig. 45.7), the
twin mausoleum windows are spanned by massive monolith
lintels, and their jambs are of course constructed in that
ubiquitous ablag device for emphasizing and_ attracting
attention. The whole is set in a tall moulded frame which
contains the foundation inscription with it own eye-catching
borders of joggled crenellated motifs in strongly contrasting
ablagq effect — there was no space to make a complete frame
(plate 45.3, note how the particular disposition of the white
marble components, pointing up and down, seems, however,
to frame the inscription).

The text of the inscription was kept to the bare essential
and, what is quite extraordinary, the basmallab was omitted. To
judge from Max van Berchem’s epigraphic survey, there is no
other case of such an omission in the foundation inscriptions of
Jerusalem. Here the reason must have been the lack of space,
for it had obviously been Tashtamur’s wish to endow his turba
with both the popular charities of a sabil providing water and
a kuttab for the care of orphans, and room had to be found for
both of them customarily at the frontage of the building. A
glance at the elevation drawing (fig. 45.7) will show that it was
particularly the accommodation of the alcove on brackets —
which is here called a kuttab — that has restricted the decorative
frame around the mausoleum windows and hence the extent of
the inscription band within.

One may wonder what has prevented the calligrapher
from condensing the ¢hzluth-type lettering further for the
inclusion of the four words of the basmallab. But then, he had
already condensed it notably by superimposing letters by three
and in one place by four; going any further would probably
have been against the rules he was working to in a one-line
inscription, which is quite adequate and well balanced as it is.
Whether or not the omission of the basmallah was in the enda
compromise due to calligraphic aesthetics, the limitation of the
facade decoration of the mausoleum was above all an
architectural compromise, and one that actually also concealed
the spaciousness of the mausoleum interior.

SABIL-KUTTAB

The interpretation of the rather curious architectural
arrangement at the north-western corner of the mausoleum
suggests itself by a comparison with what was built in Cairo at
the time. It happened precisely during the years when
Tashtamur was Grand Dawadar there that a combination of a
sabil room with a kuttab directly above was first built, and that
in such a particular siting, namely at the corner of the mosque-
madrasa-mausoleum complex of the Grand Amir Yljay al-
Yusufi who had married the Sultan’s mother.*® It was an
improvement on the allocation of separate places to them, as in
 the madrasa-mausoleum complex which Sha‘ban had built for
his mother a few years earlier.” This novel arrangement, which
hereafter became the standard formula for sabil-kuttdbs in
Mamltk Cairo, will surely have been a matter of discussion
among the amirs, and favouring it Tashtamur will have
explained it to the local builders of his Jerusalem makdn. They
did their best to comply, displaying considerable inventiveness
in producing space for each of them at the north-west corner of
the mausoleum (which alone in the complex was directly
exposed to two thoroughfares) taking advantage of the massive
walls meeting there (plans, figs. 45.3 and 45.4; section, fig.
45.11).

As for the working of the sabi/, there is a well-head in the
corner of the tomb chamber, above a cistern from where the
water was drawn (plan, fig. 45.3; section, fig. 45.8); and there is
a raised niche ‘s’ beside it in the wall adjacent to the recess ‘cl’
outside, which has its own raised niche in the rear. The two
niches are separated only by a very thin wall and water will have
been poured down from the higher one (s) into the lower one
(cl) for dispensing in the street.

As for the accommodation of the kuttdb ‘c2’ (plan, fig.
45.4) it is likewise effected largely within the thickness of the
corner walls, but it is also half-projected from the facade on
attractively carved cantilevered corbels (plate 45.1), whereby
the room inside becomes ¢c.2m square. There is an extension to
it in the upper rear (‘c3’, fig. 45.11) reached by a ladder;
although not high enough for an adult to stand in, it was
perhaps used for storage of books, and probably also as a
retreat for the teacher. Access to the Ruttdb is via stairs within
the western boundary wall of the mausoleum, now entered
only from the side of the tomb chamber; however, originally
there will also have been the usual access for the children from
outside, through a now walled-up door (to ‘c2’) in the Maydan
Lane (fig. 45.11).

MADRASA
Adjacent to the mausoleum in the rear of the site is the large
four-iwan hall ‘b’ that represents the core of the madrasa. Its
principal axis, on which lies the deeper gibla iwan in the south,
is sited roughly central between its eastern and western
boundary walls, each of which contain parts of older structures
(cf., e.g., the unnecessarily massive eastern boundary wall in
which recesses are hollowed out from both sides: plan, fig. 45.3
and section, fig. 45.10 where remains of an older arch are seen).
There is a certain decorative emphasis given to the gibla
wan in that a triple-arched window” was installed under its
vault (plate 45.13) above the place of the mihrab, which van
Berchem has seen, but of which no traces remain. However, as
usual in this fashionable iwvdn-scheme for creating a
monumental interior (largely independent of boundary walls),
all decorative means are gathered around the central rectangle

i Ri ac Dea TIR an mtb

 — here a perfect square — between the four frontal arches of the
iwans. Apart from a subtle ornament applied to both the
springers of the arch of the gibla iwan no directional emphasis
is given, except towards the centre, where the volume of the
room is increased by sinking the court and raising the vaulting
system in relation to the level and vaults of the zwéns. At the
borders of the sunk court the kerb stones are decoratively
joggled in two contrasting colours, and a shallow octagonal
basin of marble is placed centrally under the octagonal skylight
(section, fig. 45.10) forming the centre of a patterned
pavement.

The four-iwan hall is the largest interior space in this
complex and much levelling has been done in the sloping
conditions of the site. It is interesting to note, though, that only
one of the four corner spaces of this hall shares its level, i.e., that
in the south-east (both those in the west are higher,” like the
ascending Maydan Lane outside, and that in the north-east is
notably lower). One may wonder what was the reference point
for the level adopted for this hall, since it had obviously not
been easy to establish even for that of the south-east corner
room ‘b1’, because of the fabric of the ancient wall on which
this room was built (cf. elevation, fig. 45.9 and plate 45.5). As the
survey drawings have made the levels readily appreciable, this
otherwise hidden effort of the builders may be briefly noted in
a separate paragraph.

LEVELS

The general level of the madrasa iwéins is found to correspond
exactly to that adopted for the sill under the mzqarnas hood of
the principal entrance (part section, fig. 45.12B). This
important portal sill, in its turn, seems to have been positioned
with reference to the highest point in the street-level at the
 Se Ss AORN CAT EVA

facade, which is at the north-west corner (elevation, fig. 45.7);
hence it came to be placed rather high in the middle of the
facade, requiring four steps, of which three were set in front of
the building in the street (elevation, fig. 45.7; in greater detail:
fig. 45.12 A, B and C where the semicircular shape of the
successively narrowing steps is shown).

There remained, however, a slight practical problem as
regards the access to the mausoleum, for the floor of the tomb
chamber, raised above the burial vault, was considerably
higher than the level of both the portal and the madrasa (for the
madrasa-mausoleum relationship, see section, fig. 45.10). It
was cleverly solved by building up the vestibule by one step for
its entire length. Two further steps were needed; one was made
the doorstep of the mausoleum entrance and the other —a final
high step up — was placed at the inner face of that door, as seen
in the east-west section, fig. 45.8.

Communication between the new turba unit and the
simply appropriated older parts in the east was limited in the
ground-floor to the ‘sunk’ corner room between the north and
east zwans. Here internal stairs (of four to five steps) will once
have given access to both the ablution place in the well-room
‘el’ and the latrine ‘L’ (plan, fig. 45.3, the short passage leading
to the latter is seen slightly obstructed in plate 45.15 by the
substructure of the stairs to the middle floor; for its stucco half-
dome, see plate 45.14).

In thus relating the level of the madrasa hall to that of the
principal portal a certain median level was established for
communication between the mausoleum, in the highest part of
the frontage, and the dependencies of the madrasa, of which
the ablution place ‘e1’ in the east is level with that of the lowest
shop in the frontage (section, fig. 45.9); this room (e1), though,
does not necessarily date from the same time. Whatever its
earlier date, the fact that its centrally placed window in the
south wall was half obstructed when the adjacent corner of the
madrasa was built (for the oblique opening thus formed, see
plan, fig. 45.3 and elevation, fig. 45.9) is sufficient to show that
it was an older structure annexed by Tashtamutr’s builders.

RESIDENTIAL QUARTERS

Some living accommodation was already available in the
market unit with its three rzbi‘rooms. No longer used in their
original function as commercial letting, these rooms have lost
their separate access as well as their uniform size (cf. the layout
of the rubit ‘rooms in the Siig al-Qattanin, fig. 24.3). At least one
important modification surely dates from Tashtamur’s time: the
extension of the westernmost room on this level into the
masonry behind the apex of the mugarnas hood (plan, fig.
45.4); the floor level of that extension corresponding neatly
with the top of the upper mugarnas course was apparently
built simultaneously with the installation of that portal
decoration (section, fig. 45.12B). Another modification was that
the usual open-air landing at the rwbit‘ level was partially
covered by the stairs leading up to the g@ a or reception hall on
the roof court (fig. 45.9), with a small cross-vaulted room
added at the middle floor landing of these stairs (section, fig.
45.8; plan, fig. 45.4).

Two further, larger, rooms (e2* and e2°) were gained for
living accommodation on this middle floor when the tall
eastern corner rooms of the ivan hall were subdivided by a
new floor (plan, fig. 45.4). Both were made accessible from
outside the madrasa, using the existing long well-room ‘el’ as
a kind of stepping stone, as seen in fig. 45.9 for the north-
eastern room ‘e2””,

In the other upper corner room in the south-east, ‘e2*’,
where contact with the well-room below was less direct, four
steps were accommodated within a bent passage cut through
the thickness of an abutting wall (plan, fig. 45.4), a fifth
attractively decorated with a row of mugarnas elements being
set in front of it (section, fig. 45.9). The room ‘e2’ was built as a
kind of ante-chamber from where one ascends to ‘e2” which
was in all probability the Amir’s personal abode, being not only
the largest room on this level, but also the only one there
 enjoying an unobstructed view onto the Haram; moreover, its
window is the only one on this side to be decoratively
emphasized from outside, as seen in plate 45.5. Considering
Tashtamur’s reputation as seeking to learn and understand the
laws of the religion he adopted, it is not improbable that he had
asked his builders to provide a direct access from this place to
the madrasa room below (cf. the beginning of a small stairway
within the thickness of the south wall in room ‘b1’, (fig. 45.3);
no traces of its issue are now seen above).

There is a single room ‘e3’ above the ante-chamber which
belongs to this residential setting and has the benefit of an
additional window in the east wall towards the Haram (see
Levant, xi, fig. 9); it is also embellished internally by a large
fluted cap in the apex of its vaulting (section, fig. 45.9) and may
 well have been built for Tashtamur’s son Ibrahim, who died
nine years after his father and was buried in his turba,
according to the only funerary inscription that exists there.”
The northern part of this residential middle floor may, in
contrast, have been more specifically for the women of the
Amir’s household, which would explain the installation of pairs
of massive consoles under the 7zbi “type windows at the street
(not found in the Stq al-Qattanin mb‘) for carrying
mashrabiyyas.

A Mamlik amir’s residence would not be complete
without a g@a or reception hall of some architectural
distinction, and that it was sited here on the vault across the
prominent Tariq Bab al-Silsila made it duly important. Its
extent was, of course, limited there by the domed tomb
 chamber in the western wing, but the maximum was achieved,
as can be seen in the elevation fig. 45.7. Internally the
fashionable four-iwan scheme was applied to give it a focal
point, of course, only two iwéns could be developed to a
certain depth, the other two being reduced to shallow arched
recesses not even marked like the others bya slight elevation in
their level (section, fig. 45.7). The usual folded vaulting system,
terminating in a shallow fluted cap, was adopted to enhance the
central square, but it was here made only slightly higher than
the cross vaults of the zvans.

On the opposite (south) side of the large roof court (the
rooms marked ‘Q’ in the drawings which subdivide it now are
modern), a shallow external iwém, facing north (plate 45.16),
gives access to the only other decoratively vaulted room on this
level — naturally the one in the south-east with the view onto the
Haram (g) (plan, fig. 45.5). The vaulting system over its square
part (section, fig. 45.9) is basically the same as in the q@4, or in
any other area of consequence apart from the mausoleum, i.e.
the madrasa hall, the entrance to the mausoleum and the third
floor room ‘e3’ of the annex. This room ‘g’ was in fact built
encroaching on the roof of the annex room ‘e3’ (plan, fig. 45.5).
A repaired earthquake rift in the south wall (see Levant, xi, pl.
xxxva) indicates that much of this room, including its vaulting
system may be a reconstruction. Perhaps it was in connection
with such a rebuilding that its only window came to be placed
off-centred, both inside (plan, fig. 45.5) and outside in relation
to the other windows below (plate 45.5).

There is a small arched doorway, now walled up, in the
east wall of the courtyard in front of this room (plate 45.16),
whose external frame is seen in elevation in fig. 45.9. It was
originally reached from the landing in front of the third floor
annex room ‘e3’ — probably by wooden stairs. Thus all three
residential rooms of the south-east corner (e2*, e3 and g) with
a view onto the Haram were put into communication. This
together with their more pronounced decoration, either inside
or outside, is architectural evidence suggesting that the gaa
may here have been a mere traditional requisite of an amiral
residence, whereas the real focal point of Tashtamur’s life in his
Jerusalem makén was in sight of the holy precinct.
 SUVEVU

* This assessment of the building, first published in 1979 and 1980 (Levant, xi, pp.
138-61, and xii, p. 163) is largely based on the extensive survey material
established between 1971 and 1973 by A.G. Walls. His drawings —8 horizontal and
14 vertical sections — were reduced in number for that publication and
recomposed. This was done in 1978 by R. Kent who redrew and ina few instances
revised the material (without, however, taking into account the structural changes
effected in 1976 in connection with the redevelopment of the Old Jewish
Quarter). Some of these drawings are published here. I have rewritten that article
and adapted it to the subheadings devised for this book. Several people have
advised me on the wording of the text; special thanks are due to Dr Terence Walz
and, above all, to Robert Hamilton who, in addition, has recast and condensed the
sections on the portal and the mausoleum. The paragraphs on the ‘Subsequent
History’ are due to D.S. Richards.

47,"Il HISTORY
","SEE SE BAB NAC RE ELEY:

This zawiya is situated in the quarter of Jerusalem known in the
past as Marzuban, ‘near the Bath of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir’ and
‘near the Badriyya Madrasa and the Lulu’iyya’.’ This
corresponds to the area east of the central markets at the top of
the rise of the Khalidiyya Street. The building stands in what is
now known as al-Qirami Street.” There is no inscription.

DATE AND FOUNDER
The noted Siifi shaykh Shams al-Din Aba ‘Abdallah Muhammad
b. Ahmad b. ‘Uthman b. ‘Umar al-Turkamani al-Qirami al-Shafi‘i
was born on 17 Dhi’l-Hijja 720/18 January 1321.° He grew up in
Damascus and moved to Jerusalem where he became known as
an outstanding ascetic. He visited the capital, Cairo.’ He was in
contact with Shaykh ‘Abdallah al-Bistami (see p. 419) at the end
of his life.

An amir of Gaza, resident in Jerusalem, whose name was
Nasir al-Din Muhammad b. ‘Ala’ al-Din Shah b. Muhammad al-
Jili, was one of the shaykh’s disciples. Among the many waqfs
and foundations credited to the amir is this zawiya. His
endowments in favour of the shaykh and his descendants
amounted to a third of his resources. He died during the
lifetime of the shaykh.> The latter died in 788/1386, and was
buried in the zawiya.° His son, Zayn al-Din ‘Abd al-Qadir, who
was also a noted shaykh, was buried near his father in 843/1439-
40.’ Other members of the family are mentioned for the second
half of the fifteenth century, by which time they seem to have
joined the regular religious hierarchy of the city. A second
Shams al-Din Muhammad al-Qirami who was a lawyer (faqib)
in the Salahiyya Madrasa and Imam in the Aqsa Mosque (d. Rabi
I 867/December 1462), and his son, Zayn al-Din ‘Umar, also
attached to the Salahiyya and a notary (ad), who died in 880/
1475-76, were both buried ‘with their ancestors in the zawiya’
 SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

The zawiya of al-Qirami, which in a sijill reference of 937/1531
is described as the maqam”, that is, the saintly tomb, of the
shaykh, had within it a ‘house’ (dar), half of which was leased
for a period of ten years by Kamal al-Din Muhammad b. Ahmad
al-Qirami.""° Does this indicate that ordinary residential use had
taken over in the zawiya, as one might also infer from the listing
of the worldly goods of a woman resident in the zawiya in
Sha‘ban 947/March 15417""!

In Dhi'l-Qa‘da 1066/August 1656 Muhammad b. Husayn b.
Hamid, the inspector and administrator of ‘the waqf of his
ancestor on his mother’s side [the Shaykh Muhammad al-
Qirami]’, reported before the Qadi the dilapidated state of the
tomb chamber and other parts of the building and, since there
was not sufficient ready money, requested permission to
borrow against ‘the agricultural income and the rest of the
property and shops’ to meet the estimated cost of repairs, 251
piastres (ghursh asadi). The details of the necessary repairs
speak of ‘the western wall near the door’, ‘the stairway near the
entrance along with the two rooms above’, ‘the mosque (jamzt)
within the zawiya’, ‘the six upper rooms . . . the lower iwan
which is in the garden (bakiira)’ , and specifies the raising of the
garden wall by a cubit for greater privacy and security.’

In recent years the administration of the Awgqaf has
repaired and refurbished the tomb chamber and now it
functions as a mosque.
 "
47,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","STREET FRONTAGE (fig. 46.2)

The frontage is two storeys high. The variety of masonry types
and course heights indicates that the lower part of the wall has
been rebuilt in places, possibly more than once. The masonry
of the upper part of the wall is more or less uniform except at
the right-hand (southern) end where it has been rebuilt in
recent years. Modern strainer arches span the street to buttress
the frontage.

The fenestration comprises three small rectangular
windows at the upper level and two grilled windows opening
on the tomb chamber at the lower level. The iron grille of the
right-hand lower window is typically Mamlik with spherical
bosses at the intersections but it was obviously intended for a
taller opening (see plate 46.1), perhaps an earlier window
replaced by the present one. The grille of the left-hand window

is altogether cruder and both it and its window must be later
insertions.
 The main feature of the frontage is a recessed entrance
portal (plate 46.2) to the right of these windows. The ashlar
masonry of the portal is quite different from that of the rest of
the frontage and it looks as if the portal was made elsewhere
and then inserted into an existing wall. The same phenomenon
occurs at another zawiya, the Bistamiyya (above, p. 421), and we
speculate that the portal might have been added to the Shaykh’s
house when it was formally established and endowed as a
zawiya.

The shallow (0.40m deep) portal recess is spanned by a
pointed horseshoe arch, the keystone of which is undercut to
give a very tentative ogee profile to the arch. A splay-face
moulding frames the portal, rising vertically on either side and
continuing horizontally across the top. Directly above the
keystone of the arch the moulding bends upwards to form a
miniature ogee arch. At the bottom of the vertical runs of the
moulding two curious stone bosses sprout inwards from it.
Both the ogee arch form and these sprouting bosses are
extremely unusual.

The entrance door is flanked by low stone benches, and
has jambs of red and cream-coloured ablaq. The lintel is badly
weathered and cracked but traces of a carved border
decoration are still recognizable (plate 46.2). Above the lintel
is a course of simply joggled voussoirs with a more elaborate
one in the middle. The voussoirs appear to be laid upside-
down, emphasizing the non-structural nature of the decoration
and also suggesting that the portal was erected by relatively
 unskilled or inexperienced workmen. A small rectangular
window pierces the tympanum of the arch.

To the right (south) of the portal a water trough is built
into the street frontage (see plate 46.3).

INTERIOR (plan, fig. 46.2)

The entrance opens directly into the long main hall, which is
roofed in three bays by cross vaults springing from responds in
the side walls. In the south wall of the eastern bay is a plain
mibrab. A door in the south wall of the western bay opens at the
foot ofan open stairway which rises against the outer face of the
south wall to the upper floor. This will be the ‘stairway near the
entrance’ mentioned in the report of 1066/1656 cited above. A
door in the south wall of the central bay of the hall opens under
this stairway; it has no reveals and appears to be a later
insertion.

In the north wall of the western bay, behind a modern
partition wall, a door and a window open to the cross-vaulted
tomb chamber. A modern gabled timber cenotaph draped with
baize marks a grave in the south-east corner of the chamber. Mr
Yusuf Natsheh, Director of the Islamic Archaeology
Department of the Awgaf Administration, kindly informs us that
a stone trapdoor in the floor under the cenotaph opens to a
short flight of steps down to a burial vault closed by double
stone doors. This vault presumably contains the remains of
Shaykh Muhammad and his descendants (see above).

48,"I LOCATION (fig. 47.1)
","In the heart of the central market area of the city, at the corner
where Tariq Bab al-Silsila meets the so-called Siiq al-Khawajat
(Merchants’ Market), and reached by a short entrance passage
on the east side of Tariq Bab al-Silsila.
 "
48,"Il SITE AND BUILDINGS (fig. 47.2)
","Se ee ee

The site is enclosed on all sides save the entrance from Tariq
Bab al-Silsila. To the south are shops giving on Tariq Bab al-
Silsila and in addition a little market street of seven vaulted bays
(marked ‘Market Street’ on the plan, fig. 47.2) on the west side
of the Entrance Passage. To the west are shops giving on Siig al-
Khawajat, and to the north and east are various unrecorded
structures.

The Entrance Passage leads to a wide pointed-arched
doorway into a vaulted Market Hall with two tiers of chambers
on either side. A passageway on the west side of the Market Hall
leads to a great barrel-vaulted chamber (marked ‘Stable’ on fig.
47.2) which until recently was used for stabling donkeys.
Corbelled galleries on either side of the Market Hall give access
to the upper chambers. At the north end of the Market Hall a tall
archway opens to a large courtyard with two tiers of cells on the
east and west sides and more extensive chambers at the north
end. Galleries around the courtyard give access to the upper
floor chambers. These galleries and those in the Market Hall
are reached by stairways at the south-west and south-east
corners of the courtyard.

The building has not been surveyed by us and we are
greatly indebted to the Department of Islamic Archaeology of
the Awqaf Administration for generously furnishing us with
copies of drawings based on a survey made in 1981.

Although further investigation is needed to clarify the
exact sequence of construction, it appears that the shops and
Market Street to the south and west of the site were built or
rebuilt in the Crusader period, as were the Market Hall and
Stable. The major Mamlak component is the courtyard and its
two tiers of surrounding chambers.

Modifications and additions, particularly to the north end
of the courtyard, have altered the appearance of the building. It
now accommodates various small industrial workshops.
 "
48,"Il HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION
An inscription (now lost) was recorded by van Berchem over
an archway at the east end of the Market Street. It read:
 Fig. 4/.1 Location pian

Barquq . . . during the governorship of . . . Baydamur,
governor of the province of Damascus. It was constructed
under the supervision of al-Sayfi Asbugha b. Balat,
Superintendent of the Two Harams, in 788 (1386-87).!

It would appear that the building called gaysariyya in the
inscription is the same as the one which Mujir al-Din calls
wakdla, ‘a vast kbdn constituted waqf for the Haram’? and
which is now known as Khan al-Sultan.

BUILDERS

Sultan Barqig, first of the Circassian Mamlak sultans, reigned
from 784/1382 to 791/1389 and again from 792/1390 to 801/
1399. The governor, Baydamur al-Khwarizmi, was the founder
of the Hanbaliyya Madrasa (no. 42). The superintendent, Sayf al-
Din Asbugha b. Balat, appears to have held office in Jerusalem
on two occasions, the first at the time of the renewal
commemorated in the above inscription, and the second in
804/1401-2.

REVENUE

According to Mujir al-Din all sorts of merchandise were sold in
the wakdla, and it produced an income of 400 dinars a year for
the upkeep of the Haram.*

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY
The place remained a waqf of the Haram in the Ottoman
period. Three sijills, dated 941/1534, 943/1536-37 and 945/
1538-39, give details of certain officials associated with what is
there referred to as Khan al-Wakala and Dar al-Wakala.*

It is not known when the name Khan al-Sultan was first
adopted.
 GROUND FLOOR (plan, fig. 47.2)
The shops on Tariq Bab al-Silsila and Stq al-Khawajat form no
part of the wakala.

The remainder of the buildings shown on fig. 47.2 can best
be considered in three sections: (i) Market Street (ii) Market
Hall and Stable and (iii) Courtyard.

(@) Market Street

Although the Market Street is outside the main entrance to the
wakala, it is related to it by the inscription cited above
commemorating the renewal of a gaysariyya. Van Berchem
found this inscription on the west face of the archway that leads
from the Market Street to the Entrance Passage of the wakala. If
 it was in its original place when van Berchem found it then it
must have announced a building entered from that archway.
This building can only be the wakala of Mujir al-Din, the
present Khan al-Sultan. The archways at either end of the
Market Street are now largely built up to form doorways but
originally this street must have been the primary route to the
wakala.

(ii) Market Hall

The Market Hall (plate 47.1) bears a striking resemblance in its
plan to the Si al-Qattanin, which was initially referred to as a
qaysariyya (see above, p. 277). It may be surmised, therefore,
that the Market Hall is the qaysariyya that was renewed by
Barquq. Little of the Hall itself seems to have been renewed,
however. The design of the corbels supporting the galleries on
either side (plate 47.2) is typically Crusader,’ and at least one of
the stone slabs supported by the corbels bears a Crusader
mason’s mark. It appears that the whole Hall is actually a
 Crusader construction. Indeed, Enlart describes it as a ‘nearly
intact example of a type of building much used by the
Crusaders for pilgrims and merchants, but which were nearly
all reconstructed in modern times’.’ Barqiiq’s renewal of this
part of the building can have involved no more than some
refurbishing.

The Stable, reached by an integral passageway in the west
wall of the Market Hall, is also Crusader. Clermont-Ganneau
recorded many masons’ marks in its walls.®
(tit) Courtyard
Barqutq’s chief contribution will have been the construction of
the courtyard and its surrounding cells. The barrel-vaulted cells
in the middle of the west side and in the northern part of the
east side (plate 47.3) appear to belong to that construction. The
rooms in the south-west, south-east and north-west corners
appear to be later additions or modifications, as do the
Structures. at the north end of the courtyard. In the present wall
 at that end of the courtyard (see plate 47.4) is an Ottoman
inscription commemorating the construction in 1177/1763-64
of a fountain (sabil); the wall appears to belong to the same
period as the inscription. The fountain does not survive. A
modern well-head gives access to a cistern at this end of the
courtyard.

UPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 47.3)

Access to the upper floor is by means of two staircases in the
south-west and south-east corners of the courtyard and a third
on the west side of the courtyard. The last is a later addition, but
the other two appear to be more or less original. The one in the
south-east corner rises against the north wall of the Market Hall
to a landing from which a further two flights rise in opposite
directions. One goes north to the gallery on the east side of the
courtyard, and the other goes south to a passageway behind the
northernmost chamber on the upper floor of the Market Hall,
 then west alongside that chamber to the gallery giving access to
the upper floor chambers on the east side of the Hall. The
present staircase in the south-west corner rises against the west
wall of the courtyard to a long passageway (now blocked)
behind the upper floor chambers on this side of the Hall. A
passage between the two northern chambers leads to the
gallery giving access to the chambers on this side of the Market
Hall. This staircase presumably originally gave access to the
gallery on the west side of the courtyard.

Only four of the original cells remain at this level on the
west side of the courtyard, toward the south end, and on the
east side seven remain. At the north end the present structures
appear like those on the ground floor to be later, Ottoman
additions.

FORM AND FUNCTION

De RGA BG Lad EY ea ee ere tt Beiate [pists be Pai pee one
 picture the original form of the building. Thus on the west and
east sides of the Market Hall and courtyard were two tiers of
cells, the upper ones reached by galleries. A presumably
similar arrangement of two tiers of cells or larger rooms
existed at the north end of the courtyard.

This plan is typical of medieval urban caravanserais in
Cairo, Damascus and Aleppo, where merchants brought goods
for storage and distribution to local retailers. The ground floor
cells would have been used for storage and distribution, the
merchants lodging in the cells on the upper floor and their
animals stabled in the courtyard or the Stable.

49,"I LOCATION (figs. 48.1 and 48.13)
","On south side of street now called ‘Aqabat al-Takiyya (Khassaki
Sultan), about 160m west of the Haram, sufficiently high on
western slope of town’s central valley (al-Wad) to have enjoyed
a clear view of the Dome of the Rock.
 "
49,"II SITE AND BUILDINGS (fig. 48.2)
","The building comprises a large palace complex on two floors
with a small mezzanine in the north-west corner. Three
impressive entrance portals on ‘Aqabat al-Takiyya formerly
gave access to the three main components of the building. An
eastern entrance (now blocked) opened into a vestibule
leading to a large open yard on the east side of the site; a central
entrance opens directly into a spacious vaulted main hall with
ancillary chambers to the east and west and another yard to the
south; and a western entrance (now blocked) opened into a
domed vestibule from which two staircases led to the upper
floor and perhaps a third led down to the main hall.

The upper storey housed a great reception hall and
various living quarters, a piano nobile as it were, taking
advantage of the view across the valley.

The yards to the east and south, possibly once connected,
are now enclosed by later Ottoman constructions. In addition,
there have been repairs and alterations, mostly undocumented,
that make it difficult now to establish with precision the initial
layout of the palace.

A western annex comprising three storerooms entered
from the street was, as its architectural detailing reveals, built at
the same time as the palace. A house above the storerooms
appears to be of later construction, almost certainly replacing
some earlier structure there.
 "
49,"Ii HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

The street rising westwards from the valley opposite the Bab al-
Nazir street was said by Mujir al-Din to be ‘the Market Hill
(Aqabat al-Stiq), now known as the Lady’s Hill (Agabat al-Sitt),
so called because of the grand edifice (imdara ‘azima)
constructed there by the Lady Tunshuq al-Muzaffariyya.”’ In
another passage the chronicler adds that this personage built a
tomb chamber opposite her residence in the same street, that
is to say, on the north side of it.? Although neither building has
a foundation inscription — the ‘palace’ facade is, however,
decorated with some Koranic texts® — there can be no doubt
about their identity.

DATE
The Lady Tunshugq was living in Jerusalem by the year 794/1391-
 92. Mujir al-Din records that fact, and that she favoured a
Shaykh Ibrahim of the Qalandariyya Order, whose zawiya was
in the middle of the Mamilla cemetery, and built a dome over
the tomb of her brother, Bahadir, which was at the zawiya. She
also constructed a precinct around the zawiya, the building of
this in particular being assigned to the same year as above, 794/
1391-92.* Her building in the city was carried out around about
that time or probably some while before. Already by 795/1393
a Haram document’ names ‘the Lady’s Hill’, which means that
her presence and her ‘grand edifice’ had already made their
mark on the city by then.

It has been claimed that the wagfiyya for Tunshuq’s
buildings in the city exist in the Shari'a Court archives of the city
of Damascus, in the form of a series of five documents dated
between Sha‘bin 781/December 1379 and Jumada I 784/1382.°
If what was intended by this is the fozz documents, dated within
exactly the same limits as above, to which we have had access
in the form of modern copies,’ then they do not in fact preserve
Tunshuq’s wagqfiyya for these foundations. For their actual
content, see below. They do, however, show, if indeed one may
identify the lady named within them with our founder, that
Tunshuq was, in the words of the first document, ‘living in
Jerusalem as a mujdwira’ as early as 781/1379, twelve years
before the date given by Mujir al-Din.

FOUNDER

Who was this lady? There is no sure answer to this question. Her
full name, Tunshugq, daughter of ‘Abdallah, cerainly suggests
that she may have been at some time a Turkish slave. The
further appellation, al-Muzaffariyya, points to her having been
in the service (or the wife?) of a Muzaffar al-Din or, more
exaltedly, of a prince with the title al-Malik al-Muzaffar. The
honorific Jagab “Muzaffar al-Din’ is not especially common.
One might note the existence of the Amir Misa, a grandson of
Sultan Qalawtn, who did bear it. There was a plot to put him on
the throne in 710/1310-11, and it was rumoured that he died in
exile at Qiis in the year 718/1318-19.° These dates seem too
early to connect Tunshugq with him. Van Berchem has discussed
various other possibilities, including the Sultan al-Muzaffar
Hajji (reigned 747-48/1346-47). However, while remaining in
the realms of pure speculation van Berchem dismissed this
identification and preferred that Tunshug should be connected
with the Muzaffarid dynasty of West Persia, which was
overthrown by Tamerlane around about 789/1387.?
TInfortunatelv. as far as can be seen. there is no convenient
 individual in that family at that period who bore the title al-
Muzaffar or was called Muzaffar al-Din.

There is no certainty even about her name. The name of
the founder of the palace and the tomb chamber as found in the
manuscripts of Mujir al-Din’s work is spelt with an ‘s’ or an ‘sh’.
Sauvaire transcribed it as ‘Tonsoq’, while van Berchem did not
back his preference for ‘Tunshuq’ with any argument. The lady
in the Damascus documents is referred to as the lady Tunsug
(there are no vowels given), daughter of ‘Abdallah, al-
Muzaffariyya. The spelling fluctuates between ‘s’ and ‘sand the
initial letter is at times written with a ‘t’ rather than a 'v. It is
possibly hazardous to rely on what appears to be generally
inaccurate copying, but not once is a ‘sh’ explicitly marked.
This could point to the likelihood that the name should be read
as Tansuq, a Turkish word meaning ‘wonderful, precious’.!°

There is nothing in the Damascus documents to make her
origins plain or to point to the sense of the “Muzaffariyya’
epithet. Nevertheless, the temptation to make the identification
is strong. The four documents show her purchasing through
her authorised agents, an amir and a qad

1, a third and then a
quarter of the village of Bayt Safafa near Jerusalem for a total of
 100,100 dirhams. That property she then passed to the
ownership of an Amir Baha’ al-Din b. ‘Abdallah, the major-
domo of Sayf al-Din Manjak, by deed of gift (tamlik). Then in
the final document that same amir made the property a waqf in
favour of Tunsug for the duration of her life, then for the
benefit of her freedmen and his own, and then for his children,
followed by the residual category, ‘the poor of Jerusalem, etc.
There is no mention of any relationship between Tunsuq and
the Amir Baha’ al-Din.

Whatever the correct spelling of her name, and whether or
not the identity of the two ladies is the same, Mujir al-Din
recorded that the founder he named died in Dha’l-Qa da 800/
July-August 1398 and was duly buried in her mausoleum.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY Se

The palace of the Lady Tunshug (to continue with the familiar
form of the name) was incorporated into the large complex
builtand endowed by Khassaki Sultan, the wife of Sulayman the
Magnificent, in 959/1552. By the year 963/1555-56 a dilapidated
house is being described as ‘near the edifice of the late Lady
Tunshug al-Muzaffariyya, and now the edifice (imdra) of the
 Mistress of Alms and Benefactions . . ., etc.’,’* namely Khassaki
Sultan, who died in 996/1558. Another entry in the sijills, dated
985/1578, describes the east boundary of two houses as
‘formerly the palace (dar) of “the Lady”, and now al- imara al-
amira’.» This expression, which is found in an Ottoman repair
inscription (plate 48.26) on the south wall of the upper yard, is
the normal term in the sijills for Khassaki Sultan’s foundation.
Literally it means ‘the flourishing edifice’, or, rather better, ‘the
Imperial Charitable Foundation’, that is, the range of Siaff
convent, ‘soup kitchen’, caravanserai and stables, which
continued to function until modern times, although some part
of the complex at the end of the nineteenth century served as a
residence for the Ottoman governor of Jerusalem.! The
buildings are now used as an orphanage with dependent
workshops.
 "
49,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","STREET FACADE (fig. 48.6; plate 48.5)
The facade is dominated by the three entrance portals and a
large circular window. (The left-hand [easternmost] portal,
with a trefoil head, shown in fig. 48.6, belongs to the imdra of
Khassaki Sultan, built next to the palace in the middle of the
tenth/sixteenth century; see above.) The east and west
entrances are blocked, the masonry of the east portal has
deteriorated quite badly in places, and an extra storey has been
built in modern times over the right-hand (western) part of the
facade, but this detracts little from its original impressiveness.
Of the three, the east portal is the most elaborate. Its deep
(2.06m) recess, built of red and cream-coloured ablaq
masonry, has a border of red stones enclosed by parallel
quirked ogee mouldings (plate 48.1). A string course of ablaq
joggling runs around the recess above the door lintel. This
joggling is of natural limestone inlaid with black stone that has
weathered to a grey colour here and elsewhere on the facade.
Four tiers of muqarnas ‘stalactites’ support a slightly pointed
arch of red, black and cream-coloured voussoirs and a
semidome decorated with four drop-shaped inserts of black
stone weathered to grey. In the rear wall of the recess a circular
oculus, now blocked, is framed by a panel of limestone
elaborately carved to take an inlay of black stone, red glass
paste, green glass and possibly turquoise faience.'? Almost all
of the inlay is now missing. Ambiguous dovelike terminals in
the four corners (plate 48.2) have drilled ‘eyes’ and carved
‘beaks’ to heighten their (presumably adventitious) avian form.
 The central portal (plate 48.3) is the smallest and least
imposing of the three, though it encloses the widest doorway.
It comprises a shallow (1.01m deep) recess spanned by an
unusual cinqfoil arch, the top lobe of which is in the form of a
tiny cloister vault (plate 48.3). The arch and the upper part of
the rear wall of the recess are built of red, black and cream-
coloured ablaq, but the joggled voussoirs of an oculus and
string course above the door are of black stone and plain
limestone painted red to simulate ablaq. More traces of red
paint survive on alternate courses of the jambs. Moulded
corbels support each end of the lintel so as to reduce the span
over this doorway, which at 2.22m is the widest of the three. It
is the principal entrance to the main hall and is designed to
permit easy access: the usual stone benches on either side of
the recess are absent, and the corners of both the recess and the
doorway are chamfered to reduce abrasion.

The west portal (plate 48.4), 1.56m deep, is somewhat less
imposing than the east one but is also finely decorated and
impressively tall. Its red and cream-coloured ablaq stonework
is enclosed within a quirked ogee frame moulding which
extends in a double profile around the extrados of the pointed
horseshoe arch over the recess. The two mouldings are linked
directly at the springing level and indirectly by a single loop
above the keystone. Four steps flanked by stone benches lead
up to the door. Immediately above the lintel a string course of
joggled ablag identical with that of the east portal runs around
the recess. At a higher level above the door there is a
rectangular window with an inlaid star-pattern border. The
inlay, where it survives intact, consists of pieces of reddish
stone, grey-black stone and turquoise faience. An inscription,
extending across the full width of the portal, rises up around
the window to frame it and its decorative border. The
inscription contains no historical information, only the
basmala and verses 46-55 of siira xv of the Koran.'®

The large circular window (diameter of opening: 1.31m)
between the central and west doorways lights the main hall. It
is surrounded by a double quirked ogee moulding enclosing
four concentric rings of low-relief chevrons, two carved on the
outer wall face of the voussoirs and two on the splayed intrados
(plate 48.6).

The fenestration of the upper floor rooms and the
staircases is unremarkable: rectangular windows with, above
the three in the middle of the facade (see fig. 48.6), undercut
relieving blocks and slit windows (two of which are now
blocked) The four rectanoular and two = round-headed
 windows at second-storey level over the right-hand part of the
facade belong to the later additions mentioned above.

The storerooms in the western annex to the right of the
west portal appear to have been built at the same time as the
palace for the following reasons: (1) the masonry, though it
does not course through with that of the palace, is similar to it
in colour and texture; (2) the design of the flat relieving arches
over the door and window lintels — two cantilevered stones
with a simply joggled keystone between — is similar to that
found in several parts of the palace, such as above the service
stair window on the facade and above the doorway into the roof
staircase; (3) the design of the chamfered corners at either end
of the annex’s street frontage, with a pyramidal base and a
muqarnas head (see plate 48.7), is typically Mamluk; (4) there
is no opening in the west wall of the west vestibule of the
palace, suggesting that the storerooms were expected to abut
on that wall; (5) if the annex was not built at the same time as
the palace then the west end of the palace’s facade would have
been delimited by the west portal’s frame moulding, an
exceedingly awkward and unlikely procedure for Mamlik
builders whose normal practice was to extend the masonry
some distance beyond the frame moulding before turning the
corner, as happens at the east portal.

The stonework of the annex’s upper facade is smaller and
less finely dressed than that of the lower storey and appears to
be later work. It is contained between two towers of earlier
masonry, part of the same construction as the lower storey,
which rise almost to the full height of both storeys at either end
of the facade. The decorated chamfers (mentioned at (3)
above) are carved into this earlier masonry. Thus some
structure, contemporaneous with the storerooms below, must
once have extended between these corners. Later, possibly
during an earthquake, the structure, except for the more
resistant corners, collapsed and was replaced by the present
house.

GROUND FLOOR (plan, fig. 48.3)

Entered through the central doorway, the main hall (36m long
and 11.5m wide) occupies the major part of the ground floor
(plate 48.8). It is roofed by a series of ten cross:-vaults
supported on a central row of four square pillars, with two
barrel-vaulted bays at the south end. Transverse arches span
between the vaults, each springing from similar impost blocks
carved with a pair of mugarnas elements (fig. 48.18).

As the natural contours of the site rise towards the south-
west, so the floor level of the hall rises in the same direction
(sections, figs. 48.9 and 48.12). At the south-west corner of the
hall the bedrock has been cut away to extend the uniform floor
surface; the line of the rock is clearly visible protruding above
the floor here (plate 48.9). Above the bedrock in the south-
western bay a platform, 1.32m high, leads to a second arched
opening in the south wall.

The alignment of the south wall is quite different from that
of any other in the vicinity; it corresponds only to the natural
rock contours. Just as the principal north-south axis of the hall
runs not at right-angles to the street frontage but at an angle of
83° to it (plan, fig. 48.3), so the south wall was built on its
present alignment presumably for the same reason: to
minimize tedious levelling of rock outcrops in the south-
western part of the site. A later portico (plate 48.10), almost
certainly part of the caravanserai built by Khassaki Sultan in the
middle of the tenth/sixteenth century (above, p. 486), abuts on
the outer face of the south wall.

Several chambers open to west and east off the main hall.
Of the three on the west side, only the central one is now
accessible (plan, fig. 48.3). The doorways into the other two are
blocked and only a general impression of their size can be
gained by peering through a high-level window in the east wall
of the southern chamber or down a well-shaft into the northern
chamber, which has been converted into a cistern (section, fig.
48.7). This latter chamber is said by Orphanage officials to
contain a mibrab. The central chamber is long and narrow,
 running more or less parallel to the street rather than at right-
angles to the hall, apparently here too in an effort to skirt the
rising rock surface. A recessed well-head in the south wall
opens into a cistern cut in the bedrock.

A window and four doors open in the east wall of the hall.
The wide, pointed-arched window at the north end of the wall
opens into the east entrance vestibule. Its sill is at the level of
the floor of the hall, which is 0.86m higher than that of the
vestibule. To the right of that window two rectangular
doorways give access to two cross-vaulted rooms, the first of
which is aligned like the vestibule at right angles to the facade
and the second is aligned more or less parallel with the hall.
These doorways may be later insertions for they are not well
made and in each of them a short flight of steps leading down
from the hall looks like an afterthought. The blocked doorway
between the two rooms is equally crude and may also be a later
insertion. Doorways in the east walls, now blocked, are
probably the original means of access. A doorway in the south
wall of the second chamber, possibly in its original place
though much modified in recent years, has steps leading up to
a high zwan-like vault. In the west wall of this zvdn a pointed-
arched doorway into the main hall, similar in construction to
the vestibule window at the north end of this wall, is obviously
original. The zvam opens south on a small courtyard. (An
 opening in the west wall of the courtyard, connecting it with the
main hall, is plainly a later insertion.) A tunnel-vaulted passage
immediately east of the zvdn connected the courtyard with the
eastern yard (p. 485) which is now enclosed by later buildings
belonging to Khassaki Sultan’s ‘imdira (above, p. 487). From the
south side of the courtyard a window, apparently replacing an
earlier door, opens into a series of three vaults which now
house the Orphanage kitchens. The southernmost of these
vaults (plan, fig. 48.3; section, fig. 48.12) is clearly a later
addition but the others may originally have existed alongside
the palace even though no clearcut structural connection exists
between them and the rest of the palace. In any case
considerable alterations have been made here and it is
impossible to be sure what does and what does not belong to
the original construction.

From the street, the west entrance leads into an entrance
vestibule aligned at right angles to the facade. Square in plan
with pointed-arched recesses in its west and south sides, it is
roofed by a shallow saucer dome supported on triple-faceted
pendentives (plate 48.11); a more conventional high dome
would have intruded into the room above (section, fig. 48.7). In
the east wall there are two doorways (see section, fig. 48.7). The
larger, on the right, opens on a small landing at the foot of a
wide staircase (1.36m) leading up to the first floor of the
building. This is the only main access to that floor. The east-
facing archivolt of that doorway is decorated in an unusual
manner: its voussoirs are extended downwards at an angle of
10° to the vertical to form a tympanum, the underside of which
is the intrados of the segmental rear vault of the doorway (plate
48.12). The smaller left-hand doorway opens into an irregular
chamber which once housed a staircase. The staircase has now
 entirely disappeared except for a high level window, which lit
it from the street, and a blocked Opening in the wall opposite,
where it ascended southwards to the upper floor (fig. 48.3).
The sill of that opening is at the precise level (2.85m) above the
present floor which the stair, as reconstructed in Jig. 48.17,
would have reached at that point. There are further traces of
this stair, which we shall call the ‘service Stair’, at upper floor
level (p. 493). In the south wall of the vestibule there is a
blocked opening’” into the chamber,!8 now a cistern, to the
west of the main hall, described above, p. 488. Although the
bottom of the Opening is hidden behind an accumulation of
rubble on the floor of the vestibule, it may have been a door
into a staircase down to the floor of the adjoining chamber,
which is two metres lower than the vestibule. That chamber
and the vestibule with the stairs between them could provide
the only direct link between the main hall and the upper floor.
The east entrance, the grandest of the three, leads directly
into a small vestibule, Square in plan, with a beautifully
constructed ashlar folded cross vault. At the crown the vault
culminates in an octagonal cupola filled with an intricate
 eseeenpagee en SNES pe ye Cok eA I ee eee es NIE BAD SEL ULL VV ALE OER VV CHO,
as to open on the facade beyond the frame moulding of the
portal (fig. 48.6). Abutting on the internal lintel of the window
is a half arch intended to support a staircase. The blocked
entrance (1.02m wide) to this staircase faces the doorway into
the chamber.

MEZZANINE (fig. 48.4)

The staircase from the east vestibule led up to a mezzanine
consisting of a landing and three rooms directly over the gound
floor vestibule and the series of rooms to the south of it. This
Staircase may still exist but it is wholly inaccessible; in the very
limited space available it can only rise in the manner shown in
fig. 48.16 with about seventeen steps including three winders
on each of three right-angled turns up to a landing alongside a
door into the northernmost of the mezzanine’s three folded-
cross-vaulted rooms. The bulk of the staircase was built into a
pointed-arched recess, the upper voussoirs of which project
above the landing (plate 48.15).

Beyond the landing a balcony (plate 48.16) to the south
overlooks the east yard. (A blocked doorway on the east side of
the balcony is a later addition intended to connect the balcony
with a room over the entrance to the imdra of Khassaki
Sultan.) It is possible that some sort of verandah, perhaps
constructed of timber, once extended between the balcony and
the roof of the tunnel-vaulted passage 9.5m directly to the south
(see ground floor plan, fig. 48.3). A raised pavement in the east
yard follows exactly this line. Otherwise no trace of a verandah
survives except for a ledge between 0.05m and 0.11m wide
along the east wall of the palace, which might just have carried
the ends of floor joists, and a curious blind arcade above (plate
48.17) which might have supported a lean-to roof. Such a
verandah could have provided the central and southern rooms
of the mezzanine with individual access through the doors in
their east walls, though breaks in the masonry coursing at the
bottom of the jambs of these doors may indicate that originally
they were windows with higher sills.

The three rooms of the mezzanine are now
interconnected by doors in the common walls. The central and
southern rooms have tall windows opening to the west that
help to light the main hall. The northern room, over the east
entrance vestibule, has a circular oculus, now blocked, which
opened in the centre of the decorated panel in the rear wall of
the east entrance portal.

The southern room of the mezzanine backs on the rear
wall of the ivan mentioned on p. 489 above, the vault of which
(seen in section on fig. 48.10) rises nearly to the full height of
the mezzanine rooms. Since the original staircase is blocked,
the mezzanine is now reached by way of a modern stair leading
up to a cantilevered reinforced concrete walkway (plate 48.17)
to the southern room.

UPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 48.5)

There is no sign of the mezzanine’s staircase having continued
to the upper floor. The main staircase to the upper floor was
from the west entrance vestibule, described above. This
staircase emerges under a round-headed arched recess at the
west end of a rectangular courtyard, which provided the main
 access to ali the first foor apartments and to their roof. The
shape of the arch over the recess suggests that it has been
rebuilt but we may presume that it replaces a similar recess
which originally sheltered the head of the main staircase.

The service stair from the west entrance to the upper floor,
which may have been intended to allow a guard to move freely
between the floors without resorting to the main staircase,
emerged in an alcove (plate 48.18) in the room at the north-
west corner of the courtyard (fig. 48.5). This may have been a
guardroom. It has a large window in its north wall opening
under the arch of the west portal, and a short passage leading
east through a plain door into the courtyard.

Beside that door an ornamental pointed-arched recess
(plate 48.20) at the west end of the north wall of the courtyard
distinguishes the entrance to the original staircase to the roof.
The entrance opens into a short passage leading up by four
steps to a landing — now accommodating a latrine — from where
a further flight of steps (now blocked and plastered over) led
off westwards before turning south to continue over the vault of
the service stair and on to the roof. This flight of steps was
originally lit from the street by a small window directly above
that of the service stair (shown in elevation, fig. 48.6). The
window now lights a second latrine, built on the line of the
former staircase, and reached by a later stairway at the west end
of the courtyard. That later stairway partly blocks the arched
recess at the head of the main staircase. It rises to a half-landing
where it turns west through a round-headed doorway before
 turning south to an opening on the roof, now blocked by the
later addition of an extra storey. A modern reinforced concrete
extension has been made to the stairway to serve that extra
storey.

Irregular masonry in the upper walls reveals that some
alterations have been made on at least three sides of the
courtyard.’ Only the east wall retains a moulded cornice — now
surmounted by a later parapet (plate 48.21) — which probably
continued round all four sides. But since the courtyard paving
appears to be largely undamaged except at the west end (plate
48.21), it may be assumed that the alterations were generally of
a relatively minor nature: repairs rather than renovation.

Passages lead off from all four corners of the courtyard.
The one at the north-west corner leads to the guardroom,
described above. The one at the south-west corner runs past a
door (now blocked) into a barrel-vaulted room to the south
and on behind the west wall of that room to a small recess
containing what appears to bea shaft to allow water to be drawn
up from the well-head in the room below. (The passage is now
used as a store and is so filled with multifarious objects that a
complete inspection was not possible.) At the east end of the
courtyard there are another two passages. The northern one
gives access to the easternmost of the rooms ranged along the
north side of the courtyard and continues southwards to open
on the roof of the mezzanine staircase. The southern one has a
door in its south wall opening into a room in the south-eastern
corner of the courtyard. A modern doorway has been opened
in the west wall of this room to connect it to a cross-vaulted
room, now fitted with ten shower baths, which was originally
entered from the courtyard.

The solitary room at the east end of the courtyard, now
used as a laundry, is well sited — with flanking passages to
permit a healthy flow of air on all sides — originally to have
housed the latrines. The nearby room in the south-eastern
corner of the courtyard still contains four stone basins (plate
48.22) which may well have belonged to the original bath-
house. A drain uncovered beside the east entrance portal (plate
48.25, fig. 48.6) in 1982 when a new sewer was being laid under
the street is in an appropriate place to have served both latrines
and bath-house in such a location.

In the centre of the courtyard’s south wall another passage
leads to the salient feature of the palace, the great reception hall
consisting of a central sunken court with axial zwvdns opening
for almost its entire width to east and west (plate 48.23). Folded
cross-vaults over the west Zwvdn and the central court rise to
octagonal oculi, the one over the court being splendidly
 decorated with three tiers of stone mugarnas (plate 48.24),
Originally both were probably sheltered by raised lantern
domes to admit light and fresh air but exclude the wind, rain
and snow of a severe Jerusalem winter. The folded cross-vault
over the east zwdn has no oculus but a shallow circular
depression at the crown, which appears to be the result of later
replastering. In this zvdn, however, which is well lit by three
large rectangular windows in the east wall, the original vault
may never have had an oculus. Of the three windows, the
central one has a semicircular light above its lintel and a
circular oculus above that (fig. 48.8). These windows look out
on a glorious view over the valley to the Dome of the Rock.

To the south of the reception hall is a group of eight
ancillary rooms, of which the four that are contiguous with the
hall appear to be original. Those further to the south extend
beyond the south wall of the ground floor and are partly
supported by the Ottoman portico (p. 488, plate 48.10). They
must therefore be later additions. Since the alignment of the
present south wall at this level coincides with that of the
Ottoman portico it is probable that the two are
contemporaneous. All internal walls have a thick coating of
plaster concealing what evidence there may be in the
stonework of the line of the original southern boundary, which
seems not to have coincided with the immensely thick wall at
the south end of the main hall on the ground floor. A suggestion
for the original layout is shown in fig. 48.14.

WESTERN ANNEX (plans, figs. 48.3 and 48.5).

Only the two easternmost storerooms on the ground floor of
the annex were accessible to us. Both are entered from the
street. They are barrel-vaulted and extend southward evidently
as far as was possible without resorting to extensive excavation
of the bedrock. Since the bedrock rises in a south-westerly
direction, the eastern storeroom extends the further back of
the two.

At the west end of the annex, at the corner of a blind alley
leading off to the south, the lowest courses of masonry” appear
to be vestiges of an earlier building which previously occupied
this corner (plate 48.7). Considerably more of the same
masonry forms the corner at the other side of the alley,
suggesting that the alley itself was already there in earlier times.
The main street, ‘Aqabat al-Takiyya, runs east towards Bab al-
Nazir, one of the Haram gates, on the line of a street that almost
certainly dates back to Roman times.

The present house on top of the storerooms is a later
construction (see p. 488). It has a modest entrance portal (plate
48.7) opening in the lane mentioned above. Its construction
and decoration is analogous to that of others belonging to the
late-sixteenth or seventeenth century.

The western annex may have provided additional storage
space and lodgings for staff attached to the palace. Alternatively
it might have been rented out to produce extra funds for the
running of the palace or for the upkeep of the charitable
foundation connected to the princess’s tomb (see no. 49).

INTERPRETATION

In its heyday the palace of Sitt Tunshuq must have been a
sumptuous residence, the only one of its kind in Jerusalem. In
addition to the main hall occupying most of the ground floor
and the reception hall and courtyard on the upper floor, it
comprised no less than twenty-five rooms and four staircases.

Without access to the endowment deeds mentioned above
(p. 485) any attempt to assess the original purpose and use of
the various components of the building must rely on
interpretation of the architectural fabric, a process complicated
by various repairs and alterations.

The principal components are nonetheless clearly
identifiable. The main hall on the ground floor is the nucleus of
an tstabl, a standard feature of palace architecture where horses
were stabled and groomed.”! The various chambers around the
hall would have accommodated the stable’s appurtenances:
 located in the mezzanine) and so on. The open yards to the east
and south were presumably paddocks where the horses could
be exercised. A plentiful supply of water was an essential
requirement and though the present fountain in the east yard
appears to be Ottoman, it may replace an earlier source of
water at this spot. Otherwise the only alternative water supply
was the rock-cut cistern in the central chamber on the west side
of the main hall.

The great reception hall on the upper floor is a gaa
consisting of a central sunken court (durqd a) with axial ivans
opening to east and west off it. A gd is a typical feature of
Mamluk palace architecture and several other examples
survive in Cairo.” But whereas the qa as in Cairo usually had
timber roofs, the durqd‘a and iwdns here have folded cross
vaults.

The only access to the whole complex seems to have been
from the street by way of the three entrance portals. The varying
sizes and degrees of ornamentation of these portals appear not
to reflect the hierarchy of functions they serve.

The central portal presents no particular problems of
interpretation: it is designed to allow the easy movement of

 animals and supplies to and from the stables. On the other
hand, the west portal which is the main entrance to the piano
nobile is somewhat suprisingly not the most elaborately
decorated. That distinction belongs to the east portal which, in
terms of its function, seems to be the least important for it gives
access merely to the mezzanine and the east yard. There are,
however, two factors that may explain its special emphasis: it is
the first of the entrances to be reached by people coming from
the Haram, and it is directly opposite the tomb of the founder,
which has a similar panel of inlaid strapwork over its entrance
(plate 49.1) as if visually to associate the two foundations. The
west portal, the main entrance to the palace proper on the
upper floor, boasts the only inscription, part of the Koranic
stra ‘A\-Hijra’, somehow appropriate for the palace ofa refugee
from Timir’s onslaught:

... We shall strip away all rancour that is in their breasts;
as brothers they shall be upon couches set face to face; no
fatigue there shall strike them, neither shall they ever be
driven forth from there. . . .

17 Aterra:cotta pipe in the rubble blocking this doorway was apparently intended
to drain surplus water from the cistern directly into the vestibule and from there
out on to the street. Therefore the installation of the cistern probably coincided
with the closure of the west entrance. The west entrance is shown as the only open

","IDENTIFICATION
Mujir al-Din records that Sitt Tunshuq died in Jerusalem in

Dht'l-Qa‘da 800/July-August 1398 and was buried in her tomb
which she had built opposite her great palace.
 SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

Elzear Horn’s drawing (fig. 49.6) made in the first half of the
eighteenth century shows the building in its original state. At
some later time but before Creswell’s photograph (plate 49.1)
were taken in January 1920 the building was modified for
domestic use and the new doorway (plate 49.2) inserted to the
west of the entrance portal. Some repairs to the stonework of
the left-hand side of the entrance portal recess are visible in
Creswell’s photograph. In 1935 more substantial repairs and
alterations were made and many stones in the facade were
replaced, including part of a strapwork decoration in the
spandrels of the entrance portal. At this time remains of the
original plasterwork inside the tomb chamber were removed.
 STREET FACADE (fig. 49.5)

The decoration of the street facade reflects the two purposes
the building was designed to serve. Elaborately ornamental
stonework emphasizes the domed tomb chamber on the east
side of the entrance portal while to the west of the portal, the
facade of the subsidiary chambers is more modestly decorated.
Clearly the main purpose of the building was to provide an
impressive tomb for the founder. The subsidiary chambers
appear to have accommodated some associated pious
foundation, perhaps a small madrasa or a khanqah for the
Qalandariyya Sufis whom Sitt Tunshuq is known to have
patronized.

The ornamental facade of the tomb chamber _ is
symmetrical about its central axis, with two grilled windows
Opening in red, black and cream-coloured ablaq masonry
bordered by a quirked ogee frame moulding (fig. 49.5). The
window lintels are marble, part of a double string course of
greyish marble. Above that string course (see Jig. 49.12) there
 are relieving arches over the windows, each with a
flamboyantly joggled keystone and, mid-way between them, a
no less flamboyantly joggled inlay of marble. Above the
relieving arches a recessed panel of marble with cusped finials
extends for the full width between the frame moulding; this
panel appears to have been intended for an inscription that was
never carved. Above that panel a string course of red, black and
cream-coloured ablaq joggling completes the special
decoration of the tomb chamber’s facade.

The pointed-arched entrance portal (plate 49.1), built of
red, black and cream-coloured ablag, is framed by a quirked
ogee moulding which rises to the same height as the identical
moulding on the tomb chamber’s facade. This moulding
returns around the stone benches flanking the doorway. The
monolithic lintel over the door is surmounted by a joggled
string course which is undercut to forma flat arch relieving the
load on the lintel. Above that string course the tympanum
contains a panel of intaglioed strapwork analogous to the one
over the east entrance to the palace across the street (above, p.
487). No trace of inlay Survives, though the panel was obviously
 “ee eee ee ee ee egret

intended to receive one. The little aperture in the centre of the
panel serves no useful purpose; it penetrates only a few
centimetres into the masonry. The spandrels of the portal arch
are filled with a rectilinear strapwork revetment (fig. 49.9) ofa
type generally associated with north Syria (above, p. 97).

The facade of the subsidiary chambers to the left (west) of
the portal has undergone various alterations. Most obvious of
these is the new doorway, inserted some time before 1920,
presumably when the building was converted to domestic use.
Horn’s drawing (fig. 49.6) shows that there was once a small
drinking fountain (marked ‘Aquarium’) in this part of the
facade. At a slightly higher level two slit windows with
mugqarnas-decorated heads (plate 49.3) were arranged
symmetrically on either side of the fountain. The lower part of
the right-hand window has been blocked up during the
construction of the new door.

In the upper part of the facade three windows light the
upper floor rooms and, to the east of them, a fourth lights the
tomb chamber. Only the left-hand window is shown in Horn’s
drawing but the tomb chamber window is certainly original
since it is matched by similar high-level windows in its east
(plate 49.4) and north walls and a blind window in its west wall.
Of the two windows over the entrance, the western one is
modern (it is missing in Creswell’s photograph) and the
eastern one is probably a later insertion to judge by the
interruptions in the masonry coursing visible in 1920 but later
repaired.

The whole facade is crowned by a cornice decorated with
a repeating muqarnas motif, which returns over the east wall of
the tomb chamber where, about a metre and a half from the
corner, the mugarnas motif is abandoned and the cornice
continues as a simple cavetto moulding. A foliated cresting runs
around the south, east and north sides of the tomb chamber
(plate 49.5). The dome is slightly bulbous, supported by a tall,
twelve-sided drum with a cyma reversa cornice, The drum
contains twelve pointed-arched windows, one in each side.
Nowadays all but three are blocked, but originally all must have
been open except the western window; it is the only one
blocked with ashlars, evidently part of the original construction
since one of the upper storey rooms abuts against it (fig. 49.8).

TOMB CHAMBER (plan, fig. 49.3)
The main entrance opens into a tiny vestibule from which a
SFG iH TH CaF a ee Sey ts de ace pir ee a
 chamber. Originally the vestibule opened north into the zvan
on the south side of the courtyard. The east wall of the
courtyard contains a wide doorway in ablaq masonry enclosed
by a quirked ogee frame moulding (plate 49.6, fig. 49.7). The
door lintel bears a small squared kufic inscription which is hard
to decipher but may read ‘Muhammad’ or possibly ‘Muhammad
al-banna’’ (Muhammad the builder) repeated four times. This
is the only example of squared kufic from the Mamlak period
in Jerusalem (fig. 49.11). Why this doorway received special
decorative emphasis was that it led to the founder’s tomb,
approached through a narrow antechamber along the north
side of the tomb chamber. From there a door flanked by two
windows led into the chamber itself; these are all now blocked.

The lofty tomb chamber (fig. 49.8) is about 4.85m square
and unusually tall in proportion for it measures 6.25m to the
cornice above the transition zone and 11.94m to the apex of the
dome. Shallow (0.20m) wall arches on all four sides spring
from corbels decorated with two tiers of muqarnas. Between
these arches ‘folded’ pendentives make the transition from
square base to dodecagonal drum (plate 49.7). Originally the
arches and pendentives and at least the upper part of the walls
were coated with plaster, as a pre-restoration photograph
shows (plate 49.8). In the tympanums a fine moulding of two
interlacing bands of plaster followed the profile of the arches
and framed the clerestorey windows under the crown of each
arch. (As noted above, three of these windows were Open and
one, on the north side, was blind.) All this plaster was removed
in 1935. The windows in the drum are outlined by a delicate
fillet moulding carved in the stone (plate 49.9). The dome is
stilted in internal profile (fig. 49.8) and plastered.

Under the dome a plain cenotaph sits in the centre of the
chamber. The tomb itself is said to be in a vault under the floor,
entered from a rebated stone trap door next to the east wall.

MIHRAB (plate 49.10)

The mibrab occupies the middle of the south-gibla wall of the
tomb chamber. Much of its original decoration has been lost,
but it is possible to reconstruct the design from the surviving
features with the aid of old photographs. A semicircular niche
is flanked by two marble columns fitted with matching ‘thick
leaf’ capitals but different bases. They are undoubtedly of
Crusader workmanship and, as the partly unfinished surface of
the columns indicates, they were meant to be fitted into corner
angles, just as they have been re-used in this mihrab. The left-
 hand capital has a broken-off leaf into which an iron peg has
been driven, presumably to act as a support for a repair in
stucco. The bases rest on small plinths faced with red and grey
stone. A lining of marble strips around the niche, traces of
which are visible in pre-restoration photographs, survives now
only at the base where their convex curvature shows that they
were cut from columns. Three round-headed arched panels
are inset into the marble lining at this level. The pointed arch of
the mihrab is composed of thin (1-2cm) joggled voussoirs of
various marbles including rare red and green ones. The
spandrels of the arch are now undecorated but a pre-
restoration photograph reveals traces of marble strapwork
similar in design to the spandrels of the entrance portal.
Remains of copper ties located by marble plugs in the masonry
around the mibrab and its flanking windows suggest that the
lower part of the south wall was once entirely lined with marble
panelling.

The conch of the mibrab (plate 49.11) is decorated with
carved stucco, the oniy one in Jerusalem so treated. A
symmetrical arrangement of interlacing foliate tendrils and
 trefoils around a central vase is enclosed by an epigraphic
border which has four loops, each containing a trefoil. The
inscription is the basmala followed by the first part of Koran
xlviii, 27. A hole in the centre of the loop at the top of the conch,
together with a series of seven overlaps in the stucco, show how
the decoration was applied. First the marble lining, including
that of the mibrab, was set in plaster and retained by copper
ties. A timber bead was then fixed to separate the marble lining
from the conch, and the conch coated with stucco. While the
stucco was still wet a curved template (fig. 49.10) was swept in
(eight) short arcs over the surface to give a reasonably smooth
finish. Only then was the design marked out, presumably from
a pattern, and carved. The varying depth of the carving seems to
indicate that the sweeps of the template produced a somewhat
uneven surface upon which the stucco carver worked.

WESTERN DEPENDENCIES (plans, figs. 49.3 and 49.4).

The main entrance vestibule formerly opened directly into the
iwan. Beside that entrance (now blocked) in the south wall of
the zwdin there is a second doorway, which leads into two small
rooms, one (A) reached through the other (B). It is in the south
wall of room ‘B’ that the present entrance has been opened, and
room ‘A’ now houses a latrine. One or possibly both of these
rooms may originally have contained the facilities necessary to
supply water to the drinking fountain (above, p. 507). The only
cistern seen by us in the building is, however, inconvenientiy
 remote from these rooms for its mouth is at the east end of the
tomb antechamber. A wide pointed-arched opening (now
largely blocked by a thin partition wall) on the west side of the
courtyard leads into a cross-vaulted room (C) from which a
second room (D) to the south is reached. Room ‘D’ has a
window in its east wall opening into the zwdn.

A narrow staircase (plate 49.6) rises against the north wall
of the courtyard to the upper floor where it emerges ona small
open yard. The upper corners of the ground floor courtyard are
spanned by stone slabs (plate 49.12) giving an octagonal shape
in plan (similar to the courtyard of the Aminiyya: see above p.
253). The primary reason for this seems to have been to give
access, by a short passage, to space above the tomb
antechamber, enabling that to be used for a long narrow room
at first floor level. The other corners were built up solid,
apparently to give visual regularity. Two small windows in the
east and south sides of the octagon (serving to this extent as a
light well) gave light respectively to the room over the tomb
antechamber and to a double-cross-vaulted room over the
ground floor iwdn, which is entered from the yard. This room
is additionally lit by two windows overlooking the street. The
room over the antechamber has windows also in its north and
east Outside walls, and another, now blocked, which once
looked into the tomb chamber. A pair of slit windows, now
blocked, opened in the outside northern wail of the octagon
(plate 49.12) and, since that is open to the sky, these seem to be
simply ornamental.

The remaining rooms arranged round the yard (plan, fig.
49.4) appear to have served as living quarters, presumably for
a functionary attached to the tomb and its associated pious
foundation. They include in the north-west corner a small
latrine and/or bath-house with a perforated domical vault. A
staircase in an arched recess (plate 49.13) against the west wall
of the yard gives access to the roof.
 IRANIAN INFLUENCE IN THE DECORATION

While the concept and construction of Sitt Tunshuq’s palace
and tomb is typically Mamlik (see above, p. 499), three
features of the decoration show signs of Iranian influence: the
band of star pattern inlay bordering the window in the west
entrance to the palace, the stucco conch of the mibrab, and the
Squared kufic inscription at the entrance to the tomb
antechamber. Iranian influences are otherwise virtually
unknown in the Mamlik architecture of Jerusalem and there
must be some reason for it here. Further research is needed to
establish Sitt Tunshuq’s origins, but if she were, as van Berchem
has suggested, a Muzaffarid princess who fled from Timir’s
onslaught into southern Iran, then it would be natural for her
to have some souvenir of her own country incorporated into
her new buildings in Jerusalem. The actual work was probably
done by local craftsmen, however. The squared kufic
inscription, for instance — the only one from the Mamlak period
in Jerusalem — is cut in a very strange fashion, as if the mason
were unsure of the correct procedure. Moreover, the stucco
conch of the mibrab is carved rather flat with no punching and
very little drilling such as characterized eighth/fourteenth
century Iranian stucco work. (The star pattern inlay at the west
entrance to the palace would have presented no particular
problems to those responsible for the meticulous carving of
the typically Damascene panel over the east entrance. )

mosque and the church cannot be maintained.

usual ‘Syrian tower’ type, square in plan, with an octagonal
muezzin’s gallery and an octagonal domed lantern.

it was renewed (mustajadda) after 800/1397 when charitable
individuals got together and collected money to build it and to
establish endowments for it

A partial collapse of the adjacent synagogue after a heavy
rainstorm in 879/1474 gave rise to a prolonged dispute that led
to the demolition of the synagogue. The dispute was resolved
and the synagogue restored only on the intervention of Sultan
Qaytbay. The mosque and presumably also the minaret existed
at that time.

The superstructure of the minaret (see plate 50.1) was
damaged by sniper fire in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and was
subsequently repaired in 1974.

a billet moulding. Two slit windows arranged one above the
other in each side of the lower storey light the stair.

FOUNDER

The founder is named by Mujir al-Din as the Amir ‘Ala’ al-Din
‘Ali b. Nasir al-Din Muhammad, who followed his father as
governor (wali) of the fortress of Subayba. On more than one
occasion he served as chamberlain (hajib) of Damascus and
also as governor of Jerusalem. He died in Muharram 809/June-
July 1406 and was first buried in the suburb of Qubaybat in
Damascus, but was later exhumed and transferred to a resting-
place in his madrasa at Jerusalem. References to this amir in
earlier chronicles and biographical dictionaries are practically
non-existent. He is possibly the same as the ‘Ala’ al-Din,
mentioned by one chronicler‘ as having been removed in 797/
1395 from the post of commissioner for the relay-stations of the
postal service (shddd al-marakiz). The year before, according
to the same source, a new governor ofJerusalem, Shihab al-Din
al-Baridi, was appointed to replace ‘the son of the governor of
Subayba (ibn n@’ib al-Subayba)’, who had held that post for
only a few days.* Whether he held the governorship on another
occasion for a longer period, as one might infer from Mujir al-
Din, cannot be known. It was presumably owing to the fact that
 ‘Ala’ al-Din was commonly identified as above and owing to his
own period of office in the fortress of Subayba that the
foundation in Jerusalem took the name it did. Subayba still
stands today, commonly known as the castle of Nimrod,
dominating Baniyas, the town of northern Galilee (the ancient
Paneas).° It is worth mentioning that a late seventeenth-century
sijill entry (in error, one supposes) attributes the endowment
of the madrasa to “Ala’ al-Din Muhammad (sic), the governor of
the fortress of Subayba’,’

DATE

It is difficult to associate the construction of the madrasa with
the only date which may connect ‘Ala’ al-Din with Jerusalem, his
period as governor in 796/1394, because it only lasted ‘a few
days’. One can only say that the foundation dates from before
his death in 809/1406, but on account of the report of the later
transference of his body to his tomb within the madrasa, it is

possible that the building may have been completed after that
date.

ENDOWMENT

The only evidence known for the endowment comes from the
same late sijill entry referred to above, which identifies part of
the original endowment of the Subaybiyya as two orchards in
Nablus, one of them of uncertain name (Dub?) and the other
called the Gardens of the Christians ustan jinan al-nasara),
and as half of each of five gardens in Nablus (called the Spring,
al-Khasafa, the Waqf’s, the Eastern Lamps and Ibn Suwayd’s).

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY
There is no evidence that the madrasa functioned for any length
of time. We learn that towards the end of the fifteenth century
the Subaybiyya was the residence of the Shaykh of the
Qadiriyya order of Sifis, Sharaf al-Din Misa b. Ahmad b.
‘Abdallah al-Samit al-Hanafi (d. 898/1492), who used to hold
impressive dhikr sessions there every Friday eve.2 What
happened to the madrasa is not known, but the immediate
vicinity retained a connection with his descendants. A house
sold in 963/1566, was described as being ‘in the district (kbutt)
of the Governor’s House opposite (taba) the Subaybiyya
Madrasa, the residence of the Shaykh ‘Abd al-Karim [b.] al-
Samit.” Similarly in 984/1577, in another document of sale, it is
called ‘the residence of the Bani al-Samit’, and its location now
given as ‘in the Bab Hitta district (bara)!

A dispute arose over the propertv which was settled
 amicably in 1093/1682. A certain Jabir Jurayji had taken it over,
claiming that it had been made a waqf by an ancestor, called
Badr al-Din b. al-Shamiyya, although he had no documentary
evidence. Another ‘Abd al-Karim b. al-Samit, referred to as ‘one
of the administrators of, and those responsible (mutakallimin)
for, the madrasa’, claimed eight years rent, from which we may
assume that the above property transfers had been subject to a
rent payable to the madrasa waqf. These arrears Jabir agreed to
pay and also that the family waqf, whose existence he claimed,
would pay in future 150 paras annually for the repair and
general benefit (maslaha) of the madrasa.""!

HARAM FACADE

The Haram facade comprises a doorway flanked by two
rectangular windows (all blocked) and formerly surmounted
by a third window (see plate 51.1). Access to the doorway, the
threshhold of which is about 7.50m above the surface of the
Haram, was by way of a portico below the facade which
extended west from the Is‘ardiyya. Mujir al-Din states that this
portico was built at the same time as the Subaybiyya.’* Only the
right-hand (east) abutment of the portico survives against the
last pier of the portico under the Is‘ardiyya (see plate 51.1). Part
of the Ottoman barracks was built above the Haram facade in
the nineteenth century. When the barracks was demolished in
1923-24 to make way for a new school (see above, p. 207) the
window over the door was dismantled.

The masonry of the facade is pink and cream-coloured
ablaq. The lintels of the left-hand window and of the door are
of mottled red granite. The lintel of the right-hand window
(now missing) was presumably of the same material. At either
end of the door lintel are two blocks of limestone into which
have been carved similar composite blazons enclosed by lobed
medallions (plate 51.2). The left-hand medallion has twenty-
four lobes, the right-hand one has forty. The blazon consists of
a three-fielded shield: upper field blank; on the middle field a
cup charged with a napkin displayed on the middle field of a
three-fielded shield; on the lower field a cup.

STREET PORTAL

About 40m to the north of the Haram facade stand the remains
of a monumental entrance portal on the south side of the street,
Tariq al-Saray al-Qadim (plate 51.3). A line drawn through the
middle of the door in the Haram facade drawn perpendicular
to that fagade would, if produced northwards, pass almost
exactly through the middle of the portal in the street. The two
doorways appear to be at roughly the same level. This suggests
that the street portal belongs to the Subaybiyya. Since both
doors are blocked and the interior quite inaccessible there is
no way of confirming the suggestion, but in this context it is
worth recalling that Mujir al-Din includes the Subaybiyya in his
list of buildings that could be entered from inside and outside
the Haram.""

Only the right-hand (west) side and the base of the east
side of the street portal survive. Certain features of the
decoration — pink and cream-coloured ablaq, a joggled string
course, the disposition of a quirked ogee moulding which
forms a rectangular frame for the portal as well as extending
round the extrados of its pointed arch (see reconstruction fig.
51.2) — are characteristically Mamluk in style. These features
were rarely used together before the end of the eighth/
fourteenth century (the closest parallel is the west door of the
palace of Sitt Tunshuq, see above, p. 487), which tends to
confirm that this portal may have belonged to the Subaybiyya.

One stone in the right-hand jamb of the portal is incised
with two curious marks (plate 51.4) the significance of which
remains to be established.

","The Salahiyya Khanqah was established in 585/1189 by Saladin
in the former Latin Patriarch’s residence, which had been built
in the second decade of the twelfth century at the north-west
corner of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.’ Mujir al-Din?
reports that the entrance portal’ to the khanqah and various
parts of the interior were restored or rebuilt (a@mara) at the
same time as the minaret.

The minaret is erected on the solid masonry of the left-
hand (eastern) jamb of the portal. It is of the usual ‘Syrian
tower’ type, square in plan. The shaft is divided into four
‘storeys’ by moulded string courses. The muezzin’s gallery is
octagonal in plan, surmounted by an octagonal lantern.
 "
54,"Il HISTORY
","Ald MMO LORY

According to Mujir al-Din, the minaret of the Salahiyya
Khanqah was constructed by the late Burhan al-Din b. Ghanim,
Shaykh of the Khangah, before 820/1417-18.4 Mujir al-Din was
told that when Shaykh Burhan al-Din proposed to build the
minaret the Christians of Jerusalem were very upset because it
was to be above the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. A group of
them offered the Shaykh a lot of money to stop its construction,
but he rejected their offer, rebuked them severely, and built the
minaret.

Shaykh Burhan al-Din Aba Ishaq Ibrahim b. al-Shaykh
Najm al-Din Ahmad b. Ghanim al-Ansari was born in 780/1378-
79 and became Shaykh of the Khangah in 797/1394-95. He died
in Jerusalem in 839/1436.°
 "
54,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","The minaret rises directly from the left-hand (east) side of the
entrance to the Khangah. Column drums built into the bottom
course of the base strengthen the footing.

The shaft (see plate 52.1) is quite symmetrical, being
decorated similarly on all four faces. The base storey is plain. A
cyma recta moulding separates it from the second storey, which
has a slit window surmounted by a roundel in each face. The
roundels are composed of six skew-faceted voussoirs carved
with a zigzag —a distinctive feature found also at the Jami‘ ‘Umar
Minaret (no. 50) and at the Jawhariyya (no. 58) — and
surrounded by a billet moulding. A piece of broken glazed
pottery has been used to fill the roundels on the north, south
and east sides (see plate 52.2). These potsherds, different in
each roundel, would repay further investigation.
 The second storey is divided from the third by a cavetto
moulding with a repeating muqarnas motif (plate 52.2). The
third storey is pierced by paired slit windows each with a little
arched head cut in the common lintel, which is supported by a
central column. A billet moulding divides the third storey from
the fourth, which is quite plain save for three corbels on each
side carrying the muezzin’s gallery. The gallery surrounds an
eight-sided chamber and is sheltered by a modern corrugated
iron canopy. The lantern above is capped by a circular drum
and plain ashlar dome. Recesses flanked by engaged columns
and spanned by pointed arches of gadrooned voussoirs open in
all eight sides of the lantern. A continuous splay-face moulding
frames the extrados of the arches. The recesses on the cardinal
axes contain openings: small windows in the north, west and
south sides, and a larger window or door in the east side (see
plate 52.3).

IDENTIFICATION

The present building has no identifiying inscription. According
to Mujir al-Din? it is situated ‘at the Duwaydariyya Gate, one of
the gates of the Haram’. He means, of course, the gate on the
north side of the Haram, perhaps more often called in the past
the Dawadariyya Gate, nowadays the Bab al-‘Atm.

In a court document of 947/1540‘ the Basitiyya together
with Mawsiliyya (or Sallamiyya) form the west boundary of the
qaa, made a waqf by the Ayyabid al-Mu‘azzam, which is
situated on the west side of the Bab Hitta Street. It is noteworthy
that the Basitiyya and Mawsiliyya are said to meet, as it were,
around the Dawadariyya. In the record of a survey carried out
in Muharram 1067/November 1656° the Mawsiliyya and the
Awhadiyya are mentioned as properties contiguous with the
Basitiyya although there seem to be errors in the copying of the
document, since the north wall is said to be both ‘overlooking’
the Mawsiliyya and ‘built over’ (rakiba ald) the Awhadiyya. The
latter building is also placed to the east, and even the south, of
the Basitiyya! There is no mention of the Dawadariyya.

DATE

What came to be known as the Basitiyya was begun by an
immigrant from Herat. As Mujir al-Din has it: ‘The person who
first drew up the ground plan and intended to build it was the
Shaykh of Islam Shams al-Din Muhammad al-Harawi, the
Shaykh of the Salahiyya and the Superintendent of the Two
 Harams, but fate overtook him before he could build it. The
chequered career of this man, Muhammad b. ‘Ata’ Allah b.
Muhammad al-Harawi, who was twice Shafi‘l Qadi in Cairo and
for a short while the Privy Secretary, in addition to the two
positions in Jerusalem mentioned by Mujir al-Din, was ended
by his death in Dhai ’l-Hijja 829/October 1426.”

How far the building had progressed by al-Harawi’s death
one cannot tell. Construction had certainly begun.’ The date of
the endowment made by ‘Abd al-Basit, who took over the
building, was the month of Jumada I 834/mid-January to
February 1431. If we assume that the building was finished by
then, that gives a period of about four and a quarter years for its
completion. It is known that ‘Abd al-Basit paid a short visit to
Jerusalem in Dh ’l-Hijja 833/September 1430.""° Is it possible
that this visit was in connection with the completion of the
building?

FOUNDER

During his final illness ‘Abd al-Basit told a friend that he was
born ‘in the year 790 [1388] or in the year before’.!! His mother
was a Circassian and his father had received, from the sultan, a
village in the Ghuta of Damascus, in which town ‘Abd al-Basit
was born, and acquired his first administrative experience. He
attached himself to the service of the future Sultan al-Mu’ayyad
Shaykh, when the latter was governor. He followed Shaykh to
Cairo and his career prospered. Under Sultan Tatar he rose to
be Inspector of the Army, but the reign of Barsbay saw a decline
in his influence. As Ibn Taghribirdi says, he had a succession of
strong rivals, Janibak the Dawadar, Badr al-Din b. Muzhir and
Safi al-Din Jawhar. In the first year of Jaqmaq’s reign he was
arrested and his property seized (Dhti ’l-Hijja 842June 1439).
In a little over three months he was allowed to depart, not
without honour and pomp, for the Hijaz. Through the good
offices of Ibrahim, a great-grandson of the Amir Manjak, he was
permitted to move with his family to Jerusalem, where he
arrived early in 844June 1440 ‘to reside there as he had been
commanded. He lived in his madrasa which he had built
overlooking the Haram. His fears were stilled, for he had been
full of anxiety when in Mecca’. He lived for ten more years,
making visits to Damascus and performing the last of several
pilgrimages in 853/1449.’* For some years at the end of his life
he had returned to live in Cairo. On his death (Tuesday, 4
Shawwal 854/Tuesday, 10 November 1450) he was buried in
the tomb chamber he had built outside Cairo. He himself left
two sons, Abt Bakr and ‘Uthman, and two daughters, of whom
 one was the wife of the great-grandson of the Amir Manjak
mentioned above, and the other married Sultan Jaqmaq.¥

In addition to his tomb chamber he built several other fine
buildings. After having rented for a number of years a house in
Cairo belonging to Ibn Taghribirdi’s family in 821/1417 he
purchased and restored the residence of Tankiz in the Khutt al-
Kafr district.‘ Opposite he raised a mosque, sometimes
called a madrasa, which was finished in late 823/late 1420.!5

Inside the Zuwayla Gate there was a covered market
(qaysariyya) which bore his name. According to al-Sakhawi it
had been begun as a madrasa by Fayriiz the Tawashi, but
Maqrizi gives a different and more complicated history for its
site, with no mention of Fayriiz. Previous shops which had
belonged to several waqfs, most recently to the endowment of
the tomb of Sultan Bargiiq, had been taken by ‘Abd al-Basit,
converted into his gaysariyya, and made an endowment of his
‘madrasa and mosque’ (sic).!° ‘Abd al-Basit was the author of
other significant public works in Mecca and Medina. In Gaza he
built a madrasa, and two in Damascus, one of them in the
suburb of Salihiyya.'”

ENDOWMENT
An extract of the endowment document is to be found in the
Defter no. 522:!8

The waqf of the late ‘Abd al-Basit, the Basitiyya Khangah in
Jerusalem. He made provision for ten Muslim orphans,
each one of whom is to receive each month fifteen silver
dirhams or the equivalent in other coins. Their tutor is to
receive each month fifty dirhams or the equivalent in
other coins. His duty is to teach the aforesaid orphans the
noble Koran and the Arabic script in the said khangah.
Each year on the feast at the end of the Ramadan each one
of the said [orphans] is to be issued with thirty of the
dirhams described above for their clothing. Any surplus
after that is to be spent on the maintenance (mas&lih) of
the said khangah, and on the pay of the water-carrier and
his equipment,” sufficient to satisfy him, and on the poor
and indigent Muslims, those needy and impoverished. The
date of the copy (sic) of the endowment instrument is the
year 834. The village of Str Bahir in the district of
Jerusalem; the share of the said waqf is 18 qirats [34],”° the
income 4,320 [aspers].

The other Defter, no. 603, has the following brief note:”!

The wagf of al-Zayni ‘Abd al-Basit — the date of the copy of
the waqfiyya is the year 834. The village of Sir Bahir, in
Jerusalem district; 18 qirats, 3,375 [aspers].

These details in themselves suggest no more than a simple
Koran School, certainly as far as the main call on the income is
concerned. This cannot be the whole story, however one is
inclined to explain the restricted content of the extract above.
The existence of a Sifi community in the establishment from its
inception was firmly implied by Mujir al-Din, when he wrote,
“Abd al-Basit stipulated in his wagf that the Siifis should recite
the Fatiba [the opening siira of the Koran] when their assembly
was completed and that the merit deriving from this be offered
to al-Harawi [to be written] in his book’,” that is for the
heavenly credit of the Shaykh Shams al-Din Muhammad al-
Harawi (see above).

Although there is no conclusive evidence, the madbhab of
the founder and of nearly all the personnel met with in the next
two sections, suggest that the Basitiyya was an institution in
favour of the Shafi‘is.

MAMLUK PERIOD

The names of the first three shaykhs of the Basitiyya are
recorded. It seems likely that the link with ‘Abd al-Basit, clearly
Stated in one case, in fact held good for all three, and that we see
patronage in action. Shams al-Din Muhammad b. al-Khidr b. al-
Misti (768-841/1367-1438) served for some time in the

Raab ved Pulp ES Susd Laie
 Hadith specialist and devoted the last years of his life to the
study of Hadith in the Basitiyya.” After his death, ‘Abd al-Basit
replaced him by the man who had followed him in the
Chancery, Sharaf al-Din Yahya b. Ahmad b. al-‘Attar al-Hamawi
(787-853/1385-1450).™ After an initial military career, Sharaf al-
Din had entered the Chancery, acting as secretary for ‘Abd al-
Basit. He went to Jerusalem to take up the position of shaykh in
Ramadan 841/March 1438, but resigned after a while and
requested ‘Abd al-Basit to appoint Taqi al-Din ‘Abdallah b.
Muhammad b. Isma‘il al-Qalqashandi (783-867/1380-1463),
which he did. Taqi al-Din used to receive a robe of honour
annually from Sultan Barsbay through the good offices of ‘Abd
al-Basit, and al-Sakhawi, who met him and was kindly treated by
him in Jerusalem, remarks that his position declined after the
death of ‘Abd al-Basit.””

There is a further suggestion of very personal ‘charity’ at
‘Abd al-Basit’s institutions since we find in Sakhawi's
biographical dictionary the following brief entry: ‘Shahin,
resident in the Basitiyya — I believe him to have been a mamliik
of the founder . . . He died in Ramadan 895 or 896’2° The
Basitiyya in question was almost certainly the Cairo foundation.

OTTOMAN PERIOD

An account for the year 947/1540-417’ reveals that the Basitiyya
received quantities of cereals from the wagf lands at Sar Bahir
and that these were then converted into cash. The account is in
large deficit for the year. It is also possible to form an idea of the
personnel.
 The salaries were as follows: inspector 640; shaykh 650;
clerk 180; rent collector/water carrier 390. The sums still not
expended were for bawwdab 50; imam 20; recitation of Hadith
20; caretaker and distributor of Koran sections 40; twelve
readers of the Koran 270 (11 x 12 and 1 x 50). The mubdshir
(agent?) received no salary. The expenses included 144 for oil
for lighting, 300 for storage of grain. The rest was expended on
administration and collection of produce, but it is just possible
that 60 of the remainder went to the orphans” stipulated by the
founder.

In the following year, 948/1541-42, an unspecified part of
the lands of Str Bahir was leased to an inhabitant of the village
of Ibn Abi ‘Ubayd (?) for a period of twenty years at an annual
rent of 65 Aleppo [silver coins].”” That a lease for that period
was contrary to the provisions of the waqf is indicated by the
complaint brought forward by the inspector, Shams al-Din
Muhammad b. Abi ‘I-Lutf al-Shafi,” in Sha‘ban 961July 1554.
He produced an authenticated waqf document of the Basitiyya
Khanqgah to support his claim that no part of the lands should be
leased for more than one year and that there should be no
stringing together of nominally separate contracts.
Nevertheless, a lease of some land for twenty years at an annual
rent of 200 paras beginning from 1 Muharram 968/22
September 1560, was confirmed by the inspector and
administrator, Zayn al-Din Luqman b. Siraj al-Din ‘Umar b.
Abi’l-Lutf al-Hanafi (sic) in favour of the lessor, an inhabitant of
Sur Bahir.*!

By 1069/1658-9 some confusion between the Mawsiliyya
and the Basitiyya, at least in the functioning of their officials,
seems to have arisen. Shaykh Salih b. ‘Umar b. Abi ‘L-Lutf,
the administrator of the Basitiyya and ‘Ali b. ‘Abd al-Haqq b.
Abi l-Lutf, the administrator and shaykh of the Mawsiliyya,
acknowledged one another’s undisputed right to the posts.
 Salih had received money for the half post of administrator of
the Mawsiliyya and had spent it on that institution, whereas ‘Ali
having received money from Sir Bahir, the waqf of the
Basitiyya, had handed it to Salih, who himself spent it on the
Basitiyya. Thus the accounts were acknowledged to be correct.
The situation suggests the family dominance of the two
institutions, the inheriting of shares in the controlling offices
and the rationalising of the divisions of responsibility (and
remuneration?) to avoid disputes.*”
 HARAM FAGADE (fig. 53.4, plate 53.1)

The fagade above the Haram portico extends from the
Aminiyya (no. 24) eastwards as far as the portico in front of the
Awhadiyya (no. 9). The reasons for associating this facade with
the Basitiyya and not the Dawadariyya (as van Berchem
thought) are given on p. 156.

The design of the facade is notably lacking in cohesion. It
may be considered in four sections. The first, at the west end
next to the Aminiyya, includes a plain window and the
decorated entrance portal; the second, to the east of the first,
includes a group of three rectangular grilled windows; the
third, a double pointed-arched window; and the fourth, two
rectangular windows.

A billet moulding runs across the top of the first of these
sections. A similar billet moulding runs below most of the other
three sections to the east. The correlation between the two
mouldings may reflect the two stages in the sequence of
construction. In other words, the first section of facade,
containing the entrance portal, was the work of Shams al-Din
al-Harawi, and the remainder, including the billet mouldings,
was subsequently completed by ‘Abd al-Basit (see above),

The entrance portal looks very odd nowadays for there is
no apparent means of approaching it (see plate 53.2). The top
of a buttress of the Haram portico has been removed to
accommodate it. The original staircase rose from beside Bab al-
‘Atm eastward across the face of the portico: it is shown on the
1865 Ordnance Survey plan.** The doorway is now blocked. It
is set in a pointed-arched recess with stone benches on either
side. The arch appears to have been made from re-used
material. The hoodmould follows a somewhat erratic profile, as
if it were made from pieces intended for a larger arch, and its
curlicue label stops are quite dissimilar in size. The voussoirs of
the arch, carved with mugarnas elements® in a fashion
reminiscent of Anatolian Saljtiq practice, appear also to be in
secondary use. This is particularly apparent in the keystone,
which is simply cut from a voussoir and so its muqarnas
decoration is not integrated with that of the adjoining voussoirs
(plate 53.3). The source of this re-used material is not known.

To the right (east) of the portal is the group of three grilled
windows. The central window is larger than the other two, and
is surmounted by a blind triple window composed of a pair of
small horseshoe-arched openings with a circular oculus placed
 centrally above them (plate 53.4). The stone mullion between
the arched openings of the triple window is decorated with two
little corner columns with anvil-shaped capitals and bases
(plate 53.4). The two smaller grilled windows have undercut
relieving arches above their lintels. This section of the facade is
bounded to left and right by masonry ‘buttresses’ that rise to the
full height of the facade above the billet moulding. Adeep cyma
recta moulding with discontinuous down-turns at either end
connects the buttresses across the top of the facade (see plate
53.1). The single course of stones which forms a parapet above
the moulding probably belongs to later changes made in the
third quarter of the nineteenth century.

Most significant of these changes was the removal of a
dome above the room lit by the double-arched window. Early
photographs”* show the dome still in place. Fig. 53.5 shows the
relationship between the dome and the double window, which
follows a pattern set first in Jerusalem at the Is‘ardiyya (no. 33)
and followed at the Manjakiyya (no. 35) and the ‘Uthmaniyya
(no. 57). The arches are composed of red and white ablaq
voussoirs and rest on three re-used marble columns with
unmatching Crusader capitals and bases (plate 53.5). A circular
oculus in the spandrel between the arches appears to be a later
insertion, as does the wide arch above the windows and the
cornice at the top of the facade (which may have been taken
from the top of the east wall of the Dawadariyya’s courtyard: see

above, p. 162). These alterations were made presumably at the
time of the dome’s removal.
 The first window to the right of the double window has an
undercut relieving arch above its lintel and, above that, a plain
slit window. The easternmost window, with red and cream-
coloured ablaq jambs set in a shallow recess, also has an
undercut relieving arch above its lintel. The projecting string-
course cornice across this part of the facade is typically
nineteenth-century; it presumably belongs to the same
alterations that affected the rest of the facade.

INTERIOR (plan, fig. 53.3)

The original extent of the Basitiyya is difficult to determine.
There are buildings at upper floor level on all four sides of the
Dawadariyya’s central courtyard. The bulk of them appear by
dint of their segmental or semicircular window and door
arches to be Ottoman. Only the construction on the roof of the
Haram portico can be definitely ascribed to the Basitiyya. The
implication contained in the Ottoman documents cited above
that the Basitiyya was contiguous with the Sallamiyya (no. 25) to
the north of the Dawadariyya might be due to some confusion
at that time between the Dawadariyya and the Basitiyya. At any
rate, since Mujir al-Din*’ lists the Basitiyya as one of those
buildings that could be entered from inside or outside the
Haram, it may be assumed that its occupants had access to the
street by way of the staircase at the north-east corner of the
Dawadariyya’s courtyard. (The staircase against the south wall
 a ee

of that courtyard appears to be a later — possibly nineteenth-
century — addition.)

The entrance from the Haram was, as described above,
reached by way of a flight of steps built against the Haram
portico. The threshhold of that entrance is 1.70m below the
present floor level of the vestibule that it must have given access
to. This difference in levels would need about seven steps to
accommodate it. The passage from the entrance to the vestibule
is now completely blocked. A break 1.13m wide in the masonry
of the east wall of the vestibule shows where it may have
emerged, as shown dotted on the plan, fig. 53.3. If it did so, and
if the present floor level of the vestibule is the same as the
original level, then the restricted space means that the steps
must have been mostly winders and the entrance could not
have been fitted with a single or even a double door unless the
steps continued into the vestibule itself. A possible alternative
route for the entrance passage — through a recess 0.69m wide
and 1.74m high in the south wall of the room marked ‘A’ on the
plan — seems unlikely for it does not align with the entrance, it
is too narrow, and it takes no account of the break in the
masonry of the east wall of the vestibule.

The vestibule has a low window opening in an arched
recess in its south wall and a much deeper barrel-vaulted recess
in its north wall. A doorway alongside the latter recess opens
north into room ‘A’, which is roofed by a folded cross vault that
rises from little mugarnas springers (see plate 53.6). The
 recess in the south wall of this room is alluded to above.
Opposite it, a door in the north wall (which is the upper part of
the Haram wall) opens into sundry structures to the north.
These structures, including a stairway leading to a group of
later rooms above the vestibule and room ‘A’, appear to be later
accretions. Originally the door must have led from room ‘A’
into an open yard on the roof of the assembly hall and other
rooms on the south side of the Dawadariyya’s courtyard.

A doorway in the south wall of the yard opens through a
pointed-arched recess into room ‘B’. The arch of the recess
(plate 53.7) is distinctively decorated with a quadrant chamfer
around the intrados and a hoodmould around the extrados
with short lateral extensions at the level of the springers. A
metal ring fitted to the keystone would allow a lamp to be
suspended in the doorway. Room ‘B’ overlooks the Haram
through the group of three windows described above. A
pointed-arched recess above the central window may indicate
 that the little triple window in the facade was once open. The
room is roofed by a folded cross vault rising from mugarnas
springers, similar to those in room ‘A’, to an Octagonal cupola
at the crown. There are pointed-arched recesses in the east and
west walls. A door (now blocked) in the east wall led into the
adjoining room ‘C’, which enjoys a fine view of the Dome of the
Rock through the doubled-arched window in its south wall. Tall
pointed-arched recesses in all four walls reduce the central
area of the room to a nearly perfect square in plan. This area
was originally covered by a dome as described above; it is now
cross-vaulted. A door placed off centre in the north wall of the
room has no reveals and seems likely to be a later insertion. In
that case access to room ‘C’ would have been through room ‘B’.
A door (now blocked) in the east wall of ‘C’ leads into room ‘D’,
which is roofed by two cross vaults separated by a transverse
arch. The west vault is both narrower and higher than the east
vault. In the middle of the walls at the south end of each vault
are windows surmounted by slit windows (the eastern of which
is now blocked) Opening on the Haram. High-level windows in
the east and west walls of the room are blocked. A door in the
north wall has no reveals, Suggesting that it is a later insertion,

in which case access to room ‘D’ must have been only by way of
rooms ‘B’ and ‘C’,

now they have not been completed’. Before the Ghadiriyya
was constructed, the minaret was erected in 769/1367-68 and,
to the west of it, a portico of three bays was added. It is the site
to the west of that portico, extending as far as the Karimiyya,
that the Ghadiriyya occupies. Its present north boundary is the

56,"lil HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

A Qadi’s report (mahdar), dating from 879/1 474, described the
Ghadiriyya Madrasa as being ‘on the north side of the Masjid al-
Aqsa [i.e. the Haram] near Bab Hitta’ (see below). It is one of the
institutions on the north side of the Haram according to Mujir
al-Din, who in his systematic Progress around the perimeter of
the Haram deals with the Ghadiriyya between the Karimiyya
and the Taltiniyya. Moreover, a vandalised inscription over the
door, which van Berchem re-established on the basis of
Sauvaire’s notes and the information from Mujir al-Din, fixes
the position of the madrasa.

FOUNDER

The Ghadiriyya Madrasa within the Haram was endowed
by the Amir Nasir al-Din Muhammad b. Dhulghadir after
his wife, Misr Khatin, had built it from his resources, No
waqf document for the building survived, so a report
testifying to the waqf was produced, which was
authenticated in our own time, in the year 897 [1491-92],
The madrasa was built during the reign of al-Malik al-
 Ashrat Barsbay in the month of Rabi‘ II in the year 836
[November-December 1432].

This is what Mujir al-Din tells us?

The Amir Nasir al-Din, a prince of the Turcoman dynasty of
the Dhulghadirids,? is a well-known figure. His full name was
Muhammad b. Ghars al-Din Khalil b. Zayn al-Din Qaraja b.
Dhulghadir. Qaraja, a leader of Turcoman nomads, made his
appearance in 735/1335 and gained recognition by the Mamlik
State as naib of Elbistan (or Abulistayn) in 738/1337. The
dynasty, thus begun, lasted for two centuries, existing
precariously between the major powers, the Mamluks and the
Ottomans, and its immediate rivals, the other Turcoman
principalities of Asia Minor. Nasir al-Din Muhammad himself
Was set up in Elbistan by the Ottoman Bayezid I in 801/1399. Ibn
Taghribirdi characterises him as ‘very troublesome and
rebellious.’ Having conspired often with amirs in revolt
against Cairo, towards the end of his life he made his peace with
the Sultan Jaqmaq and paid an honoured visit to Cairo, during
which he married a daughter to the Sultan. He died inJumada
Il 846/October 1442.

The sources mention a wife of Nasir al-Din, called Khadija
Khatin, who went to Cairo in 819/1417 and again in 838/1435 to
plead for the release of sons,’ but, in spite of the speculations
of van Berchem and others, there is no evidence to link her
with Misr Khatan mentioned by Mujir al-Din, nor any direct
information about this latter wife.

DATE

The foundation inscription, or rather the remnant of it seen by
van Berchem and minimally surviving today, imparts only the
title of the reigning sultan, al-Ashraf, and the month of the year,
Rabi’ II. As mentioned above, if, as was done by van Berchem,®
this remnant is brought together with the text of Mujir al-Din
and the copy, although incomplete, which Sauvaire made of the
inscription, the date of the construction may be confidently
placed in Rabi‘ IT 836/November-December 1432.

Nasir al-Din came to Cairo in Shawwal 843/March-April
1440 and left either on 25 April or 2 May.’ On his return home
he visited Jerusalem. We know this from a document copied
into the Jerusalem Court records,"" which tells a complicated
Story. The document consists of the authentication by the
Maliki Qadi (dated 17 Rabi II 889/14 May 1484) of an earlier
document attested by the Hanafi Qadi, Shams al-Din
Muhammad al-Dayri (dated 27 Jumada II 879/8 November
 SA OTIGLTLYYAA

1474) and a whole series of later authentications down to 986/
1578. The content confirms what Mujir al-Din had to say and
amplifies it. The Amir Nasir al-Din arrived in Jerusalem on 7
Dhu'l-Hijja 843/10 May 1440 and inspected what his wife Misr
Khatin had had built as his legally constituted agent (wakila),
he himself being described as the wagqif. The initial waqf
document was shown to him but he found the provisions made
in it to be inadequate. The changes he made will be found in the
following section.

ENDOWMENT

The endowment document drawn up by Misr Khatiin on behalf
of her husband, Nasir al-Din, was extant in 843/1440, but to
accommodate the information of Mujir al-Din, one may assume
that both it and any record of the additions made by Nasir al-
Din had been lost by 879/1474 when the Qadi al-Dayri
accepted evidence of the testimony of Nasir al-Din concerning
the waqf. It is more than tempting to consider this report the
one referred to by Mujir al-Din. A mistake in the date, 897 for
879, would be very easily made in fully written-out Arabic
numerals."" This is a translation of the important section of the
mahdar:

He accepted as authentic . . . the testimony of his
Excellency . . . Nasir al-Din Muhammad Beg b. .. . Khalil b.
Dhulghadir, the endower of the said Ghadiriyya Madrasa
situated in Jerusalem on the north side of the Masjid al-
Aqsa near Bab Hitta, one of the gates of the Noble Masjid al-
Aqsa, [that] when he came to Jerusalem on 7 Dhi’l-Hijja in
the year 843 [10 May 1440] and saw what had been done by
his agent, the virtuous Lady Misr Khatiin, his wife, who
built the said madrasa when he made her his legal agent in
that [task], and was shown the instrument of endowment in
which it was stated that she had established the posts of
shaykh, mudarris, imam, factor (Gmil), rent collector,
bawwab, servant and other office holders and fourteen
Sifis, with small stipends from the waqf made for them in
the district of Jerusalem, namely the estate (mazra‘a)
called al-Hasaniyya, and its outlying part (?) (kharija)
known as the Hikr Land, a market (kbd) in Jerusalem, and
a covered market (qaysariyya) with the ground rents in the
city of Ramla, he considered the sources of income for the
wadf and the stipends insufficient, and provided the waqf
specified above in the city of Aleppo, namely the complete
Date Market (Khan al-Balah) and the complete ‘Ali’s Bath,
both situated within the Victory Gate, one of the gates of
Aleppo, and half the Bath of...(?) and half the Bath
of...(?) and the ruined area which is between the two
baths outside the Gate of the Gardens.”

He made this a waqf for the said madrasa and its
beneficiaries, and increased their stipends. He instituted a
comptroller of the wagf to keep the accounts and a
commissary (mutasaffir) to fetch the income from Aleppo,
while maintaining the office of rent-collector. He assigned
to the mudarris six dirhams daily, to the shaykh of the
Koran recitation’ two dirhams daily, to the imam two
dirhams daily, to the factor, who is the clerk, two dirhams
daily, to the water-carrier a dirham a day, to the attendance
clerk a dirham a day, to the deputy overseer two dirhams
daily and to each of the Sifis one dirham a day.

He made certain stipulations, one being that the office
of overseer of this waqf and of the said madrasa should go
to his daughter, the great Lady . . . [wife]'* of his late Majesty
the Sultan al-Malik al-Zahir Jaqmaq . . ., then to each
successive sultan of Egypt, who was empowered to entrust
the administration to a person of his choice to deputise for
him. The person charged with deputising was to receive
ten dirhams daily. He also provided for a further deputy
for this person, to act on his behalf, and he assigned to him
two (Syrian)’* dirhams daily.

A further stipulation was that the office of bawwab in the
said madrasa should belong to .. .the Shaykh Shams al-Din

527
 Abi ‘Abdallah Muhammad b. al-Muhandis_ al-Hanafi
during his lifetime, and after him to the most upright and
God-fearing of his sons and grandsons, because he is by
descent a Turk, who alone qualify. He assigned to him
daily, including the addition made, three dirhams.

He assigned to the comptroller two dirhams a day, to the
commissary to fetch the money from Aleppo two dirhams
daily, to the servant a dirham daily, and to the rent-
collector a dirham daily.

He provided the aforementioned house""® for ... Shams
al-Din Muhammad, the bawwab referred to above, to use
for his own residence or to let. It is his duty to watch over
the place assiduously day and night, either personally or
through some assistant employed for this purpose. If his
descendants die out, the house belongs to whoever is the
bawwab of the madrasa...

OTTOMAN PERIOD
The titular overseers seem to have been the descendants of the
Amir Nasir al-Din. In the years 963-64/1555-56 ‘Ali Beg b. Shah
Rukh is mentioned and described as amir liwa’ of Gemigesek.""”
Nearly twenty years later the overseer is Shah Rukh b.
Muhammad Khan, another member of the Dhulghadir
dynasty.'* The practical job was done by the mudarris. A
dispute over the headship of the madrasa in 1092/1682
produced further evidence of the stipulations of the founder,
namely that the madrasa as a whole was restricted to immigrant
Turks from Anatolia (al-Turk al-afagiya min al-Arwdm), or
from elsewhere, living in Jerusalem, and that residence in the
madrasa was laid down for the mudarris and [acting-]
overseer.'? These conditions are not mentioned in the text
translated above, but they are implied or paralleled in the
conditions concerning the bawwdb. Although it is nowhere
expressly stated, it seems natural to assume that the madrasa
was intended for Hanafis. The affiliation of the known
personnel would also strengthen this assumption.”°

From amongst the waqfs made initially by Misr Khatain on
her husband's behalf, to my knowledge only the market in
Jerusalem”! receives any mention in the Jerusalem Court
records. In addition to the Aleppo properties, with which Nasir
al-Din Muhammad endowed the madrasa, income also came
 from a village in the district of Mar‘ash and another in that of
Qal‘at al-Rim. This must have been a yet further endowment
after Nasir al-Din’s. For sample accounts during the period 962-
983/1554-1576, see the separate table (below).

In Sha‘ban 964/June 1557 a contract for repairs to the
madrasa was made. The cost to the waqf was 10 gold pieces. The
following elements of the madrasa are mentioned: the
assembly hall, the balustrade (si#tara) opposite the minaret, two
upper chambers and also an upper house (bayt), the kitchen
and the bawwab’s house (dar). There is also mention of ‘fitting
the lead of the column’ (tarkib rusds al- amid) and ‘building a
small balustrade for the pool (birka), two courses high’.”?

Later, in 984/1576, the mudarris complained that the
madrasa was in a ruined state and that the former mudarris had
not performed his duties and did not deserve the 32% gold
pieces which were being held for him from the year 981/1573-
74. The amir liwa’ and the Qadi ordered the sum to be
deposited in the Citadel with the Ketkhtda for future
expenditure on the madrasa.”* Yet at the end of the eleventh/
seventeenth century the traveller ‘Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulusi,
who visited the madrasa, speaks of it as flourishing.4
 "
56,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","HARAM FACADE (fig. 54.5, plate 54.1)

Like the rest of the building, the Haram facade has undergone
several changes. The ground floor fagade survives largely
intact, but most of the upper floor facade has gone.

Over the years the ground level of the Haram has risen,
concealing the bottom of the facade. A pit was dug against the
facade in 1979 to reveal a stone pavement in front of the
building, 0.70m below the present ground level (plate 54.2).

From Mujir al-Din’s description (above, p. 105) we know
that the Ghadiriyya extended eastward from the Karimiyya.
Immediately to the east of the Karimiyya is a curious half arch,
now blocked, followed by a small portico of four bays. To the
east of the easternmost bay of the portico there is a plain door
into the chamber marked ‘A’ on the plan (fig. 54.3).

Next to that chamber the right-hand part of the facade
projects 3.43m further into the Haram to align with the face of
the earlier portico to the east. An arch spans from the eastern

 abutment of the east bay of the Ghadiriyya portico to the salient
corner of that right-hand part of the facade (plate 54.3), which
contains the entrance portal flanked by one rectangular
window on the left (west) and two on the right. Each of the
windows is surmounted by a pseudo-relieving arch with
rebated joints around the voussoirs, above which are pointed
slit windows (the upper part of the left-hand one is missing and
the lower part blocked). Between the two right-hand ones is a
 AL-Ghddiriyya

somewhat larger window with an unusual trilobed head. A
diaperwork moulding extends across the facade above these
windows to abut on the haunch of the earlier portico to the east.
The western part of this moulding is missing. It can be assumed
to have run across the full width of the salient part of the facade.
Traces of a simpler cavetto moulding run ata lower level across
the facade of the portico to the west.

Above the diaperwork moulding the lower part of the
eastern end of the upper floor facade survives. At a point
roughly above the trilobed window a vertical break in the
masonry may indicate the position of a jamb of a window in that
facade, though the masonry to the left of the break is very
similar to that on the right and the whole upper facade is too
incomplete to allow any firm conclusion to be drawn about its
original appearance. Elsewhere the masonry of the upper floor
facade (including a re-used volute finial, see plate 54.3) is
clearly a later rebuilding except at its west end where some of
the original masonry survives. In that surviving masonry a
shallow recess with a sloping sill is spanned by three tiers of
mugqarnas corbelling (plate 54.4). This recess contains a
window, now blocked.

The entrance portal is set back 0.06m in the salient facade.
It is built of a red and cream-coloured ablaq enclosed by
quirked ogee frame moulding that accommodates the set-back.
The entrance door is in the rear of a slightly pointed horseshoe-
arched recess. Several voussoirs and the keystone of the arch
are composite; that is, composed of two stones. The coursing of
the ablaq masonry in the spandrels is adjusted to align with
individual voussoirs at the extrados of the arch, a technique
observed previously at the Khatiniyya (no. 31) and the
Arghiiniyya (no. 32). On either side of the doorway are the
customary stone benches. Traces of the defaced foundation
inscription are barely discernible on the door lintel, which
carries a pseudo-relieving arch composed of rebated voussoirs
like those over the windows. A rectangular window opens in
the tympanum of the arch.

GROUND FLOOR (plan, fig. 54.3)

The blocked half-arch at the west end of the building opened
into a passage that led north to the area beyond the Haram wall.
The four bays of the portico are roofed by cross vaults
separated by transverse arches. A door (now blocked) in the
north wall of the portico once led to structures that no longer
survive beyond the Haram wall (see below). The door at the
east end of the portico gives access to the small cross-vaulted
chamber, ‘A’.

The main ground floor rooms occupy the wider, eastern
part of the building. Here the plan is dominated by three
substantial masonry piers, the south faces of which are on the
same alignment as the facade of the portico to the west. To the
south of the piers stand three barrel-vaulted rooms (B-D) and
a cross-vaulted vestibule. To the north of the piers a barrel-
vaulted passageway (plate 54.5) runs along the northern
boundary wall. The reasons for this extraordinary layout are
not apparent; presumably the piers and their interconnecting
arches were intended to support some structure on the upper
floor, which no longer survives (see below).

Because of the rise in the level of the Haram surface, three
steps now lead down to the threshold of the entrance doorway,
which leads directly into the vestibule. The splayed embrasure
of the window above the doorway is skewed so as to open
externally in the centre of the tympanum of the portal and
internally more or less in the centre of the vestibule’s south
wall (plate 54.6). The vestibule opens north under the arch
spanning between the middle and west piers. A doorway (plate
54.8) beside the west pier opens south into room ‘B’, lit by a
window in the Haram facade. There is a cupboard-like recess in
its east wall. From the space between the east and middle piers
two doors give access to the two eastern rooms (C and D), lit by
windows in the Haram facade. Room ‘C’ has cupboards in its
east and west walls. The door into room ‘D’ turns through 90°
to open in the west wall of the room. An unusual feature of
 these doorways into rooms ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ is their arches, which
are semicircular and not pointed as was usual in the Mamlik
period. A second, wider door leads into room ‘D’ from the
north at the east end of the passageway. At the west end of the
passageway a hole roughly 0.60m in diameter has recently been
opened into chamber ‘A’ but there is no sign of an earlier
opening. Chamber ‘A’ must have been reached only by way of
the door in the Haram facade.

The lighting of the passageway is complicated. There are
no windows in the north wall. Some light is borrowed from
room ‘C’ through a high-level window in its north wall (plate
54.7) and additional light percolates in from the trilobed
window in the facade through a long tunnel that runs through
the upper part of the wall between rooms ‘C’ and ‘D’ (see
section, fig. 54.6).

UPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 54.4)
A staircase in the west pier (plate 54.8) leadine to the ween.
 floor is now blocked. It obviously led west to the upper floor
where, evidently, the major part of the Ghadiriyya stood. Today
only the blocked window at the west end of the facade and
remains of a folded cross vault beside that window bear witness
to the earlier structure (see plate 54.10). Since folded cross
vaults are almost invariably square in plan, we can reconstruct
the original shape of the room (marked ‘E’ on the plan) roofed
by that vault as shown dotted on fig. 54.4. The reconstruction
shows that the room extended about 1.50m further north than
the present north boundary wall. That this was indeed the case
is confirmed by early photographs (such as plate 54.9). These
photographs, taken before the Birkat Bani Isra’1l was filled in,
reveal that the lower part of the Haram’s north wall is much
thicker than the upper part and that a series of arches were built
on top of the lower part of the wall to support an extension of
the western wing of the Ghadiriyya out over the pool. The exact
layout of that extension is not entirely clear, but the
photographs show that to the east of room ‘E’ a second staircase
 led down to various structures to the north of the portico. It
must have been to these structures that the door in the north
wall of the portico gave access. None of them survives. Nor do
any of the upper floor structures such as those mentioned in
the contract dated 964/1557 (see above). At the east end of the
 upper floor a parapet wall separates the Ghadiriyya from the
roof of the adjoining portico where the Tiliiniyya Madrasa
(built before 800/1398) once stood. That madrasa, as Muir al-
Din records, was reached from the stairs of the Bab al-Asbat
Minaret.”

57,"HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

On the north side of the Bab al-Nazir Street to the east of the
Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir may be found a remnant of an
inscription over a doorway, as follows:

... Hasan al-Nasiri al-Hanafi (may God forgive his sins) on
the date, Dha’l-Qaf‘da].. .!

This may well survive from the Hasaniyya Madrasa, which
Mujir al-Din said was situated ‘in the Bab al-Nazir [Street] over
the Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir’.

DATE

According to Mujir al-Din, the madrasa was built in 837/1433-34
and the date of the waqf was 1 Rajab 838/31 January 1435.7 Al-
Sakhawi wrote that the madrasa was built after (8]35/1431-32,
but says that it was in the Haram (al-Masjid al-Agsa).° Did he

confuse this foundation with the earlier Hasaniyya Madrasa,

built by Shahin al-Hasani al-Tawdsbi over the Bab al-Asbat in

the reign of al-Nasir Hasan, that is, early in the second half of the
fourteenth century?

FOUNDER

His full name is given as the Amir Husam al-Din Abi
Muhammad al-Hasan b. Nasir al-Din Muhammad b. Jamal al-
Din ‘Abdallah — al-Kashkili al-Hanafi, who served as
Superintendent of the Two Harams and as governor of
 Jerusalem? A person called Husdm al-Din Hasan, whom we
may identify with the founder, having already been governor of
Gaza, was appointed governor of Kerak in 810/1407.° In 822/
1419 we find him, during his tenure of the governorate of
Jerusalem, arriving in Cairo with many citizens of Jerusalem
and Hebron to complain of the peculations of the Qadi al-
Harawi.’ He was dismissed from his Jerusalem post and
replaced by the Amir Nasir al-Din Muhammad b. al-‘Attar al-
Hamawi in 827/1424° If that was his last official position, then
he built his madrasa in retirement. When reporting his death,
Maqrizi writes, ‘He came [to Cairo] from Jerusalem [and held],
in the reign of al-Nasir Faraj and subsequently, several
governorships, in Gaza, Jerusalem and elsewhere.” Al-Sakhawi
quotes the information in Maqrizi’s chronicle and adds, ‘I think
he was Superintendent in Jerusalem and the founder of the
madrasa there which is mentioned by Ibn Ruslan.’ The author
and the work referred to here are unknown to us.

Husam al-Din al-Hasan died in the year 842, either, as
Mujir al-Din tells us,!"" on 15 Dhi’l-Hijja (29 May 1439) or,
as Maqrizi maintains,!? on Sunday, 23rd of that month (7 June
1439). According to the latter, he died in Cairo, but Mujir al-Din
says that he died in Jerusalem, and was buried in the Mamilla
Cemetery near the Shaykh Abii ‘Abdallah al-Qurashi.

WAQF
The date for the waqfiyya given by Mujir al-Din, 1 Rajab 838/31
January 1435, is confirmed by the Defter no. 602,” at least as far
as the year is concerned. Defter no. 522 has the date 938/1531-
32, but this is surely an error.'4

Both defters list the Palestinian properties which supplied
the madrasa with its endowment income. In the case of Defter
no. 602 alone an annual income figure is given for each one:
 Deiter no. 522 contains a précis of the provisions of the
wagfiyya. The personnel was intended to be as follows, and it
will be noted that although the wagfiyya précis refers to a
 Mamilttk Jerusalem

‘madrasa’, as do all other sources, there is no provision for
students of law and one might well have expected the
foundation to be called a khanqah or zawiya.

(a) the Shaykh, who was to exercise the leadership in
prayer (imadma) of the madrasa and, although the text is not
clear at this point, to give instruction in the Koran. It was his
duty to attend the Safi office of prayer (wazifa) after regular
evening prayer with the rest of the inmates. For allowances he
received 1 Jerusalem rotl of bread daily and 1% rotls of olive oil
monthly. Ex officio he served as administrator (n@zir) in
cooperation with the Shaykh of the Salahiyya, and received 100
dirhams monthly.

(b) There were 10 foreign, ‘wandering’ dervishes (fuqara’
Gfaqiyya), each of whom was to receive 4 rotl of bread and 4
dirham daily. Later in the précis, however, an extra oke of bread
daily and 15 dirhams monthly is specified for each one. The
salary of the musaddir, their shaykh, was reduced from 30 to 15
dirhams each month.

(c) Of the 10 Siifis (szifiyya) on the establishment, each of
whom was to receive 2 rotl of bread daily, one was to serve as
servant (farrash) for 30 dirhams monthly, another as bawwdab
and a third as teacher of the orphans (fagqih), both for the same
monthly emolument.

(d) There were to be 10 Muslim orphans learning to recite
the Koran ‘in the domed chamber (qubba) on the south wall’.
Each was allowed % rotl of bread daily and 7% dirhams
monthly.

(e) The control of the waqf finances and the keeping of the
accounts was to be in the hands of a factor (@mil), and his
allowance was % rotl of bread each day and 30 dirhams each
month.

(f) The staff included a water-carrier (saqqa’) to supply the
needs of the madrasa.

The founder stipulated that the Shaykh and all the inmates
and the staff should assemble every Friday morning in the
madrasa to recite four stiras of the Koran, no. 18 (the Cave), no.
36 (Yasin), no. 56 (the Protection), and no. 67 (the
Sovereignty), and then finish with the normal petitioning
prayers (du @’). The merit of all this was to be dedicated to the
founder. Another stipulation was that every day after sunset
prayer there should be four persons to recite from the Koran
(buffaz) in the Haram arcade at the Bab al-Nazir. The chief of
these should receive 9 dirhams monthly and the other three 7
each. The readings should be to the merit of the founder, his
wives and his brother.

As was normal practice, an order of priority for the
disbursement of the income was established, if not all the
charitable purposes could be met. On the other hand, any
excess of income was to be spent on the distribution in the
madrasa of sweetmeats in the months of Rajab and Sha‘ban, and
of meats and foodstuffs for the feasts at the end of Ramadan and
at the culmination of the pilgrimage. The residual beneficiaries
of the waqf were to be the poor and indigent ofJerusalem at the
discretion of the adminstrator.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY
After the completion of the building, the founder appointed as
the shaykh of the madrasa Taqi al-Din Aba Bakr b. Taj al-Din
Muhammad b. ‘Ali b. Ahmad b. Da’tid b. Abi ‘LWafi’ (b.. 793/
1391, d. 859/1455), who proceeded to take it as his place of
residence."" His son, Taj al-Din Muhammad b, 841/1437-38, d.
891/1486) succeeded him in the post of shaykh (see p. 456).}8
In 945/1539 the revenues of the lands the wadf held in the
villages of ‘Inab and Umm Taba were farmed to Mustafa b. ‘Ali
the Janissary (al-Inkishari :), who was a resident of the Jerusalem
Citadel. He paid 700 aspers as a down Payment and undertook
to pay the rest, 1,000 aspers, at the end of the year. He was also
responsible for the payment of the tithe and what was due to
the sultan (al-kbdss).° Another sijill entry, dated 968/1560
records an agreement between the nazir of the Hasaniyya,
Husam al-Din Ya‘qub (who was the nazir also in 945/1539) and
a Yusuf b. ‘Abdallah, acting as agent for the Ketkhuda of

5326
 Jerusalem, that the latter owes 41 dinars for the revenue from
half the village of Dayr Dabwan.”

It is probably correct to assume a continuing connection
with the madrasa on the part of the family which supplied the
first two shaykhs, named above. The mutawalli of the waqf was
the Shaykh Ahmad al-Wafa’l in 981/1573, at the time when the
sipabi of the village of ‘Inab, appearing before a commissioner
of the Governor ofJerusalem, complained that the villagers had
sold the olive crop without his knowledge. His timar was one
third of the village, plus two thirds of the tithe (1shr). The rest
was still waqf for the Hasaniyya.”! Furthermore, Asali quotes
two sijill entries, in one of which ‘Abd al-Qadir b. Musa al-Wafa’
(sic) replaces his two brothers as holder of one quarter of the
‘teaching position’ (wazifat al-dars) in 1168/1754-5, and in the
other a Badr b. Misa al-Wafa’ succeeds to the same post in 1200/
1785-6.
 "
57,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","STREET FRONTAGE (fig. 55.5)

The street frontage is two storeys high, crowned by a cavetto
cornice. It extends 19.46m west from the entrance portal of the
Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-Din (which projects 0.82m further into the
street). At a point 13.11m from the ribat’s portal a salient
containing the entrance to the Hasaniyya projects 0.35m from
the rest of the frontage. This salient has undergone major
repairs at some time, but otherwise the frontage remains
largely intact.

The lower courses of masonry in the lower storey are
different from the upper courses, which are similar to those of
the upper storey (see plate 55.1). The masonry of the repairs at
the west end is, of course, different from the rest. Its date of
construction is not known. All that can be said is that it was built
after the ribat, since it blocks the east archway of its portal, and
before — perhaps immediately before — the construction of the
Hasaniyya. At the east end a pointed-arched doorway (now
blocked) once gave access to the space between the street
frontage and the south wall of the vaulted halls of the ribat. This
space is now inaccessible.

The main facade is on the upper storey, set back 0.02m
from the frontage of the lower storey and extending eastward
over the portal of the ribat where it projects south to follow the
alignment of the portal. It is arranged more or less
symmetrically about a central slit window which opens in the
assembly hall above the mihrab. The lintel of that window is
 decorated with an arch of miniature gadroon voussoirs on the
outer face and a moulding on the soffit (plate 55.2). On either
side of this window two large rectangular windows are set in
pointed-arched recesses. The arch of the left-hand (west)
recess has been replaced with a crude segmental arch. Though
several stones in the right-hand arch have also been replaced,
enough of it survives to show that it (and presumably the left-
hand one) were decorated with gadroon voussoirs (plate 55.3).
The right-hand window retains its original grille. To west and
east of these windows are a further two, both surmounted by
slits. The east one is directly above the entrance portal of the
ribat.

At the west end of the frontage the entrance salient,
including a short upper-storey extension supported on two
damaged roll corbels (plate 55.4), is about 2m lower. Much of
this appears to have been rebuilt.

ENTRANCE (plate 55.5)

The entrance has lost its original form in the rebuilding and
now consists of a plain segmental-arched doorway. The lowest
courses of masonry survive, however, and two clear breaks in
the masonry on either side of the doorway reveal that the
original door was set in a recess and flanked by stone benches.
The lintel of the present door, bearing the foundation
inscription (plate 55.6), appears to be in its original position.
The rebuilding of the doorway has masked much of the text of
the inscription but enough is legible to show that it belongs to
the Hasaniyya.

The doorway opens into a landing at the foot of a flight of
Stairs rising eastward to the upper floor. A blocked window in
the north wall of that landing may belong to the Qashtimuriya
Madrasa which, according to Mujir al-Din, was near the
Hasaniyya; it was endowed in 759/1358. The south-east corner
of the wall containing that window can be seen as a break in the
masonry some 2.37m to the east (see fig. 55.4).

UPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 55.3).
The stairs lead up to a wide top landing from which one door
Opens west into a small room (A) perhaps intended for the
bawwéb, and a second leads into a barrel-vaulted passage that
runs north then west. At the west end the vault of the passage
has collapsed. It leads into a group of mostly ruined structures
that might well originally have provided living quarters for
personnel on the establishment (see above).

At the corner where the passage changes direction it is
 roofed by a folded cross vault. A door in the east wall under this
vault leads under a small porch into the open courtyard of the
madrasa. A cavetto cornice similar to that on the facade runs
around three sides of the courtyard (see plate 55.7); the east
side has been replaced (see below). Two cells (B and C) on the
west side of the courtyard, one of which (B) was locked and
inaccessible to us, are lit by high-level windows on the
courtyard. On the north side are three cells ( D-F) with
windows overlooking the courtyard of the ribat to the north.
The common wall of cells ‘E’ and ‘F’ has been removed and the
door from the courtyard into ‘E’ blocked. Both cells are now
entered through the door of ‘F’ (which has a rebuilt head — see
plate 55.7). In all probability a fourth cell occupied the north-
east corner of the building, but it and the original structures on
the east side of the courtyard have been replaced by a modern
construction. The cells on the east side of the courtyard were
probably similar to those on the west side . At the south end of
the east side a corridor runs east to give access to two rooms (G
and H) situated above the entrance portal of the ribat. Room ‘G’
has a window in its north wall overlooking the courtyard of the
ribat, and room ‘His lit by the windows above the ribat’s portal.

On the south side of the courtyard a plain door flanked by
two rectangular windows opens into the assembly hall. Above
the door is a small triple window comprising two arched lights
surmounted by a circular oculus (see plate 55.8) of a distinctive
type observed earlier at the Sallamiyya (no. 25) and the
Basitiyya (no. 53).

The assembly hall is roofed in three bays by a folded cross
vault with narrower cross vaults to east and west. The bays are
separated by two transverse arches rising from double-
muqarnds springers reminiscent of ones in the Palace of Sitt
Tunshuq (see fig. 48.18). The folded cross vault has single
muqarnas springings and a fluted cupola at the crown (see
plate 55.9). Besides the windows on the courtyard, the hall is lit
by windows overlooking the street (described above). Two
cupboards open in the north wall and a third (now blocked)
opened at the south end of the west wall. Opposite that third
cupboard a door (also blocked) opened east into room ‘H’.

MARBLE PANELLING

The outstanding feature of the assembly hall — indeed, of the
whole building — is an unusually well preserved marble dado
incorporating a mibrab. This dado originally ran around all
four walls but some sections of it, particularly on the north wall,
are missing. It is composed of vertical panels of fine red marble
 and black bituminous limestone framed by narrower strips of
greyish marble. In two places, about one metre to either side of
the mibrab in the south wall, the marble frame is in the form of
an arch with a circular loop at the apex. The spandrels of the
arched frames are filled with white and black marble and the
tympanums with red marble. Below the tympanums each frame
contains a panel of rare black-and-white speckled marble. The
marble will have come from old columns sliced along their
lengths — a customary Mamluk (and earlier) practice. The
panels are bedded on white plaster, and discrepancies such as
rough chipping of the edges are filled with plaster which has
been coloured appropriately red, black or grey to match. The
whole dado is capped by a timber bead, which separates the
panelling from the plastered wall surface above.

MIHRAB (plate 55.10)

This beautiful mihrab, one of the finest in Jerusalem, is lined
and faced with a veneer of marble with a mosaic revetment in
the conch. A quirked ogee moulding frames the upper part
where it projects above the dado. The lining is arranged in two
tiers. The lower tier is the same height as the dado and consists
of a grey marble frame containing seven slightly countersunk
panels of alternately red marble and black limestone with
trilobed heads. At the apex of each of the seven panels is a little
circular depression in which the remains of a turquoise faience
stud can still be seen.

A timber bead separates this tier from the upper tier and
 extends onto the wall face on either side to meet the frame
moulding. At this level the grey marble lining contains seven
panels of mosaic, five in the recess and one on each side on the
wall face. This mosaic is composed variously of strips of
mother-of-pearl and chips of turquoise faience as well as red,
black and yellow stone. The lining has come away in places to
reveal wooden battens reinforcing a plaster bed.

Another timber bead separates this tier from the conch
and the marble facing around it. An arch-shaped stone at the
base of the conch has the word ‘Allah’ incised in it to receive a
paste filling that no longer survives. The mosaic pattern of six-
pointed stars and hexagons is composed of rhombs and
triangles of red, black, yellow and brownish stone and tiny
pieces of turquoise faience.

The veneer of grey marble around the conch is made up of
three large slabs complemented by three smaller pieces at the
top. The flamboyant decoration of this veneer — representing
an arch of very elaborately joggled voussoirs within a frame of
ovals and trefoils enclosing swags with trefoil finials in the
spandrels — is actually an intaglio filled with red paste and
bitumen. In this way a striking effect is achieved without the
enormous difficulty of using real marble for the inlays. This
technique developed in Cairo in the late eighth/fourteenth
century, perhaps as a result of a shortage of marble.‘ This is the
only instance in Jerusalem. Discontinuities in the design where
adjoining marble slabs meet suggest that the patterns were
carved before the slabs were raised in place. A groove chased
round the extrados of the arch forms a loop at the apex, runs
along horizontally and then descends, thus forming a
rectangular frame around the spandrels. The groove is
encrusted with gold leaf. The circular loop at the apex is
hollowed out as if to receive some kind of filling, of which no
trace survives. Four similar circular sockets at the corners of the
outer frame above the dado and two in the loops above the
arched panels of the dado are likewise empty. Since the rest of
the panelling survives largely unplundered except for the
broken-off faience studs in the lower lining of the mihrab it is
perhaps likely that these sockets once contained faience
bosses.

mouth ofa large rock-cut cistern numbered 22 in the Ordnance

from where water will have been distributed through windows
in the other three walls. The well has fallen into disuse.
 "
59,"Il HISTORY
","An inscription on two marble plaques on the exterior of the
south wall gives the date and the intended purpose of the
building:

This well (bir) was renewed (juddida) in the reign of . . .
Sultan al-Malik al-Ashraf Barsbay. That [was done] during
the superintendency of... Husam al-Din Hasan Quja, state
governor and Superintendent of the the Two Harams . . .
The hag Ibrahim al-Rimi dedicated his diligent care to its
construction [at his expense]... and he has stipulated that
water may not be drawn from it except for the poor and
needy (al-fugara’ wa'l-masakin) and that it is not
permitted for any one [employed to draw water there] to
supply other than them. Dated Jumada II 839 (December
1435-January 1436)?

The word juddida in the inscription is ambiguous. It is
normally taken to mean ‘was renewed’ but could mean ‘was
built anew’ (see above, p. 278). The only discernible indication
that the present well-house may replace an earlier installation
are four large blocks of stone, one at each corner, which form
footings for the walls (see plate 56.1). However, al-‘Umari
(c.745/1345) makes no mention of any building here and the
present well-house appears to be a single uniform
construction. The cistern below will of course be much older.
 "
59,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","EXTERIOR ( plates 56.1 and 56.2)

Each of the four external walls incorporates a pointed arch,
blocked up except for a plain entrance door in the east side and
rectangular windows in the other three sides. A billet moulding
forms a continuous cornice round all four sides. The stone-

faced dome rises directly from the roof and culminates in a
stone crescent finial.
 INTERIOR

Two crude steps lead up to the entrance door. Within, the dome
rises directly from the walls, oversailing the corners without a
transitional zone; presumably it is carried on stone beams
across the corners but since the interior is coated with plaster
the structure is concealed. Plastered basins in the window sills
must have held water drawn from the cistern. Cupfuls of water
could then have been passed through the windows.

II SITE AND BUILDINGS (figs. 57.2 and 57.3)

The site is bounded by the Haram to the east, by the lane, Zuqaq
Bab al-Mathara, to the north, by the Ablutions Place to the west,
and by the Baladiyya (no. 43) and the Ashrafiyya (no. 63) to the
south.

The site and its environs were described by al-‘Umari
before the construction of the ‘Uthmaniyya:

... At the Gate of the Ablutions Place (al-tahara), which
contains two lavatories, one for women and one for men,
... four steps lead from the ground level of the Haram to
Bab al-Mathara . . . after which there are seven steps
leading to a longish lane by which one reaches the lavatory
for men [on the south side of the lane] and the flight of
Steps to the upper floor of the lavatory for women {on the
north side]... Adjacent to Bab al-Mathara is [part of the
Haram’s west] portico . .. spanning nine piers. Here in the
thickness of the [Haram] wall are two doors leading to two
cells, one of them for a guardian and the other fora Sifi.!

Thus al-‘Umari has nothing to say of the area later to be
occupied by the ‘Uthmaniyya, except perhaps that it contained
two cells. The Ablutions Place lay to the west of the site, which
sloped down towards it.

The building consists of four main components: a domed
tomb chamber against the Haram wall, a madrasa complex and
a western annex on the ground floor; and a range of imposing
rooms at upper floor level on the roof of the Haram portico.

The madrasa complex in particular has undergone
ts original form.
Essentially it comprised a grand entrance portal on the street,
which opens into a vestibule giving access to the tomb chamber
leads south into a
central courtyard. The east wall of the courtyard is the Haram

DATE

The inscription, which was published by van Berchem, is very
problematical. A translation is given based on van Berchem’s
understanding of its text,> although it is right to point out that
his own footnotes present various other possibilities:

In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. The
construction of this blessed madrasa was ordered by the
noble and honourable Lady Isfahan Shah Khatin,
daughter of the late Amir Mahmiid, of the family of
‘Uthman, known as the Khanum (may God show her His
benevolence). She passed away in the year eight hundred
and forty [1436-37]. Its construction was completed at the
close of the aforementioned year through the efforts of the
Khwaja Jami‘, son of Sati, from Asia Minor (al-Raimi)...[?]

FOUNDER

Mujir al-Din makes it quite clear that he had taken note of the
inscription. What he says in the continuation of his entry on the
‘Uthmianiyya is as follows:

It was endowed by a woman from a great family in Asia
Minor (Riim), whose name was Isfahan Shah Khatin,
called Khanum. It possesses endowments in Asia Minor
apart from those in this land. Its date is above the door,
namely the year 840 [1436-37]. The benefactress was
buried in the tomb chamber adjacent to the wall of the
noble Masjid al-Aqsa [i.e. the Haram], may God Almighty
have mercy on her.

Who this lady was is still not sure. The Turkish titles, the
connection with Asiatic Turkey and the epithet in the
inscription, ‘‘Uthmaniyya’, may suggest that she belonged to
the Ottoman family. Van Berchem argued that the vagueness of
Mujir al-Din’s wording points in the same direction, assuming
that the historian felt such circumspection necessary in the
period of Mamlik-Ottoman rivalries and hostilities in which he
Was writing. However, there is no known Ottoman family
member who may easily be recognized as her father. The only
one called Mahmiid, a son of Mehmed I, was born about 816/
1413, was blinded by his brother Murad II, who acceded in 824/
1421, and died of plague in Bursa in 832/1429, when he would
 have been sixteen.‘ The explanation of the nisba ‘Uthmaniyya is
a problem, but perhaps to be an ‘Ottoman’ was not the same as
being a member of the ruling family itself. The Ottoman land
register no. 602° does not give the lady the isba al-‘Uthmaniyya
— although the name of the madrasa remains the same, of
course.

When did the benefactress die? Was it in 840/1436-37?
There are decided difficulties in the reading of the inscription.®
It is clear that the building was completed ‘at the close of the
aforementioned year’, but it is puzzling that Mujir al-Din, if the
inscription is supposed to be recording the date of Isfahan Shah
Khatiin’s demise, did not repeat that information when
mentioning her burial in the tomb chamber. He refers to the
actual occurrence of the date 840 in the inscription in his
phrase, ‘its date is above the door’, without saying ‘of its
endowment’ or ‘of its construction’ (although van Berchem
translates’ as ‘Au-dessus de sa porte est inscrite la date de sa
construction’). Could it be that Mujir al-Din was also none too
sure about the meaning of the first occurrence of the date in the
inscription? Ipsirli’s edition of the Ottoman Defter no. 522 has
no entry for the ‘Uthmaniyya, but Defter no. 602° gives the date
of the wagfiyya as 844/1440-41! Only relevant biographical
information and a reliable identification would solve this
problem. The tomb chamber contains two cenotaphs, only one
of which bears an inscription.'° This has neither the same name
nor title as the founder of the ‘Uthmaniyya. Indeed, the date is
— somewhat disconcertingly — 23 Shawwal 804/26 May 1402. If,
 after all, the occupant could be identified as Isfahan Shah, van
Berchem was prepared to consider the possibility of a mistake
by the carver, who may have written ‘4’ in place of ‘40’. Would
such a mistake have been left uncorrected? In any case, it does
not explain the 844 date. Could the ‘40’ have been left off?

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

The names of several persons who held the post of mudarris in
the ‘Uthmaniyya during the seventeenth century have been
collected by Asali.'' They were mostly Hanafis. The first
mudarris may well have been Siraj al-Din Siraj b. Musafir al-
Rumi, who settled in Jerusalem in 828/1424-25. Mujir al-Din
repeats the story’” that Siraj al-Din resigned when he read the
wadf condition ‘that the shaykh should be the best scholar of
the age’ — with no mention of any restriction to Hanafis. In 990/
1582 a shaykh of the madrasa surrendered his position to be
divided between two persons,’ one of whom was a member of
the Ibn Jama‘a family, normally Shafi — as indeed was the
Muhyi al-Din b. Jama‘a, who was assigned a Koran reader post
there in 937/1531.'*

The mudarris seems to have functioned as the
administrator (mutawalli) of the madrasa too. One of the
sources of waqf income he administered is named in two Court
registers of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries
as the village of Kafar Qara.’° The Defter no. 610,!° which was
written soon after 1540, mentioned Kafar Qara (written without
Giacritical-nointe) ac the only Palech tion onde Ae
 madrasa. It was situated in the Nablus area and belonged
completely to the madrasa, producing 3,400 aspers annually. It
must have been restored to the madrasa shortly before then,
since an earlier entry of 938/1532” reports that this village had
been incorporated into the Diwan of the Circassian [Mamluk]
sultanate after it had been seized by ‘the Shaykhs of the
mountain of Nablus’. Before that it had maintained among
other things ‘the bucket [spelt sa#/] suspended in the tarima of
the ‘Uthmaniyya Madrasa’, presumably a system of water
supply. The last register entry referred to was concerned to
prevent the titular administration of ‘the bucket’, whose
endowed income had ceased, from receiving money from the
separately endowed ‘basin’ (tdsa), supplied by a certain
Mahmid Celebi with waqf funds from Asia Minor.

At the same time another dispute arose. In May 1532 anew
person had been confirmed by the mudarris in a Koran-reader
post left vacant by the decease of the previous holder !8 Within
six days, however, the brother of the deceased had established
that the latter had only held the Position as his deputy, and that
Sultan Sulayman had confirmed all appointments in force from
the settlement made at the time of Selim’s conquest. Some
weight was given by the court to the fact that the mudarris had
acted on the principle that the former holder, in this case the
deceased, could nominate _ his replacement, but the

replacement could offer no evidence to answer the case set out
19
above.
 Two sijills from the early seventeenth century”? show that
sums of money from the Egyptian treasury, charitable
expenditure of the sultanate, were sent yearly to Jerusalem.
From these sums, as well as others from individuals, the
permanent officials and a long list of other beneficiaries of the
madrasa, such as the various ‘readers’, benefited. One should
note that ‘nine students’ (talaba) are mentioned without
separate identification.

In 1066/1656 the mudarris/mutawalli ‘Ali Effendi al-Lutti
requested an official inspection of the building and permission
to borrow against future income for necessary repairs. The
amount estimated officially was 525 Asadi piastres, and the
features of the madrasa mentioned, in most cases to be
demolished and rebuilt, are as follows:2!

The west wall which supports the upper house (bayt) and
the passage, the south facade of the upper house and the
doorway, the east facade and the door of the kitchen, along with
its cooking ranges (awyaq), the south cross vault running
eastwards, the balustrade/curtain-wall (sitara) partly above the
kitchen and partly above the passage, the north wall of the
upper house built over the lower mosque (@mi‘) and an zwan
to the west, the north house (bayt) of upper ma zal (a term not
fully understood) next to stairs giving access to the assembly
hall (majma‘) and upper mosque, the upper vault of the wall
(sitara) dividing the upper from the lower ma zal, the north
and west walls of the upper house built over the shops, the
 tomb chamber with its dome, the upper facilities (murtafaqat),
and the zwéns of the ablutions place. There was also provision
in the report for the blocking of a door of the upper mosque
and the opening of a new one, to alter the old door of the
assembly hall opposite the mosque into a window (tdqa) and to
open the old cupboard (khizana) as a door to lighten the arch
(aqd) (meaning?).

The reference to a lower mosque and to an upper mosque
along with an assembly hall, all of which is reminiscent of the
description of the Tankiziyya, strongly suggests that the
‘Uthmaniyya too was founded for both the study of law (figh)
and for Sufi devotions.

Asali is inclined to believe that the ‘Uthmaniyya
maintained an active teaching role ‘for four centuries at least’.
Any decision on that depends on one’s general view of the
nature of the numerous appointments recorded for this and
other institutions (see pp. 73-74). One should nevertheless
remember the mention of nine students early in the
seventeenth century. Asali accepts the likelihood that the
madrasa became a private dwelling during the eighteenth
century, and such it has remained until the present day.
 "
60,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","HARAM FAGADE (fig. 57.6, plate 57.1)

The Haram portico that supports the upper floor of the
‘Uthmaniyya was erected in 737/1336-37.” In the Haram wall
under the portico are two rectangular grilled windows
belonging to the ‘Uthmaniyya, one for the tomb chamber and
one for the lower mosque.

The facade above the portico extends from the Ashrafiyya
(no. 63) northwards to within 3.10m of the upper part of Bab al-
Qattanin.** A billet moulding forms a cornice along the full
length of the facade. Early photographs show that a northward
continuation of the facade formerly encompassed the upper
part of Bab al-Qattanin (see plate 31.1), and this may have
belonged to the ‘Uthmaniyya. It was demolished in the 1920s.
Beyond Bab al-Qatténin it contained a window that was
decorated very like the present window at the south end of the
facade, which has ablag jambs and is set ina recess spanned by
four tiers of mugarnas corbelling supporting a shallow fluted
conch (see plate 57.2).

To the right (north) of this southern window are paired
rectangular windows surmounted by a small muqarnas-
headed slit window above their central mullion. Further to the
right is a single window, decorated like the paired ones with a
joggled red and cream-coloured ablaq pseudo-relieving arch
over the lintel and surmounted by another high-level
mugqarnas-headed slit window. Between the two slit windows,
a curious feature in the form of a mugqarnas capital from a
hexagonal column (fig. 57.9) projects from the facade.

The most striking feature of the facade is a large double
window, the pointed arches of which are supported by three
re-used marble columns. Above the window a panel of red and
cream-coloured ablaq contains two roundels each composed
of interlocking radial voussoirs. A continuous diaperwork
moulding runs around the extrados of both arches and
encircles the roundels. At the top, above the roundels, a course
of ablag joggling extends across the panel, which is framed by
downward vertical extensions of the billet cornice moulding.
These descend to the level of the springings of the arches,
where the moulding ends at each side in an unusual angular
return (see plate 57.3). Indistinct traces visible in van
Berchem’s photograph” taken in 1893 suggest that the billet
moulding originally continued across the top of the panel.

To the right of the double window is a recess spanned by
four tiers of muqarnas corbelling supporting a shallow, fluted
conch. This recess contains a grilled window with ablaq jambs
and two ablaq pseudo-relieving arches above its monolithic
lintel. To the right of that window is a smaller plain rectangular
window. All the rectangular windows in this facade retain their
original iron grilles.
 Sahar A Rh toda ho) BO tS tent t Aleta

A pointed dome supported on an eight-sided drum with
gadroon-arched windows in each side rises above the paired
rectangular windows and is clearly visible from the Dome of
the Rock terrace. A similar but somewhat larger dome
originally rose above the double-arched window: it was
demolished some time between 1893 and 1914.”

STREET FACADE (plates 57.4 and 57.5)

The north, street frontage of the ‘Uthmaniyya has two distinct
components: (1) a decorated fagade to the left (east) containing
two superimposed windows of the tomb chamber and a flight
of steps rising to a terrace before a grand entrance portal (plate
57.4); and (2) the plain facade of the western annex to the right
(plate 57.5). The latter projects 1.96m beyond the frontage of
the portal, continuing the outer line of the terrace.

The annex extends westward from beside the entrance
portal as far as the present entrance to the eastern wing of the
Ablutions Place, which now serves as a ladies’ lavatory. It is
three storeys high. A distinct change of masonry at top floor
level shows that the top storey is a later construction, perhaps
part of the repairs proposed in 1066/1656 (see above, p. 546).
Of the two lower floors, the upper is at the same level as the
ground floor of the madrasa, while the lower forms a basement
underneath. A flight of eight steps in the street— one more than
in al-‘Umari’s time, due no doubt to later resurfacing of the
street — leads down to the basement level. At this lower level the
annex has two doors opening from the street into two vaulted
rooms that must once have been the shops referred to in the
document cited above. The left-hand (eastern) door has
obviously been rebuilt in recent years; originally it was
probably pointed-arched like the right-hand one. Both doors
have small windows above them. A window at the west end of
the basement facade lights the western room. Above the
basement four rectangular windows light three rooms at
ground floor level, described below.

As mentioned above, the decorated facade of the tomb
chamber and the entrance portal (plate 57.4)”’ is separated
from the street by a little terrace reached by a flight of seven
steps ascending from the street beside Bab al-Mathara (see
plan, fig. 57.3). The principal features of this facade are framed
by a quirked ogee moulding which extends across the base, up
round stone benches flanking the entrance, back across the
facade one course above the base before rising beside the
Haram wall (which is the eastern extremity of the facade),
returning right to pass above the lower window of the tomb
chamber and then stepping up over the entrance portal and
down next to the annex (which is the western extremity of this
part of the facade). Within this stepped frame moulding the
stonework is red and cream-coloured ablagq.

The grilled lower window of the tomb chamber Opens in
a shallow recess with a sloping sill and four tiers of muqarnas
corbelling at the head. A joggled string course runs across the
facade above the level of the window lintel. Above the lintel the
string course incorporates a decorative relieving lintel with an
undercut soffit. A specially elaborate piece of joggling is inlaid
in the face of that relieving lintel. A pointed-arched window
vertically above the grilled window also lights the tomb
chamber. It opens in the plain masonry of the upper left-hand
corner of the facade, which is not enclosed by the frame
moulding. The dome of the tomb chamber rises above this
masonry, but not high enough to be visible from the confines
of the narrow street.

The tall, pointed-arched portal recess contains the
entrance door and a high-level window. The lintel over the
door is slightly recessed behind the surrounding masonry. A
course of distinctively-shaped voussoirs above it has a queer
arcuated soffit as if to represent a relieving arch. Above that
course runs the joggled string course, here composed of
specially elaborate voussoirs like the one over the tomb
chamber window. Two courses above that is the inscription
carved ona sunken panel with bow-shaped ansae at either end.
The window in the upper part of the recess has a muqarnas
 head and fluted conch which, though damaged by the later
insertion ofa timber window frame, bears astrong resemblance
to two of the windows in the Haram facade.

of which appear to belong to later rebuildings.

GROUND FLOOR (plan, fig. 57.3)

The entrance door opens into a square vestibule roofed bya
folded cross vault, which has a little octagonal recess decorated
with mugqarnas at the crown.

A double door on the left (plate 57.7) opens into the lofty
tomb chamber (10.92m high), which has windows in three
sides: two on the street; one on the Haram; and one (now
blocked) in a pointed-arched recess which opened south on
the courtyard of the madrasa. The window in the east side,
overlooking the Haram, may have belonged originally to one of
the cells mentioned by al-‘Umari (see above) which predated
the present construction, for its embrasure is splayed
asymmetrically as if an earlier opening in the Haram wall had
been adjusted so as to open in the middle of the east side of the
tomb chamber.

At a higher level, directly under the dome’s zone of
transition, a splay-face moulding in the west wall of the
chamber reduces the plan to a perfect square (see plate 57.8
and fig. 57.7). The transition from this square base to the
circular dome is effected by squinches in the four corners.
Between the squinches are four arched windows, blind ones in
the east and west sides, one now blocked in the south side, and
one in the north side which remains open.

On the floor of the chamber are two cenotaphs, one of
pinkish stone and the other of wood (plate 57.9). These stand
on a low stone plinth. Four stone posts decorate the corners of
the stone cenotaph. Each of the posts has eight concave sides
with lanceolate excisions in the corners and bulbous domical
caps carved with the usual ‘drooping petal’ pattern. The
adjacent wooden cenotaph stands against the south side of the
stone one. Since it partly oversails the stone plinth, it would
appear that it was placed there some time after the erection of
the stone cenotaph (which presumably marks the grave of the
founder, Isfahan Shah). It is the only one in Jerusalem made of
wood. Its west end (see plate 57.7) is inscribed with the epitaph
of a lady, Khawand-gan, who died on 23 Shawwal 804/26 May
1402, about thirty-five years before the construction of the
‘Uthmaniyya. Koranic inscriptions are carved in the top and
bottom of the four sides, and ornamental roundels are carved
in the middle of the south, east and north sides (see plate 57.9).

A door in the west wall of the vestibule, opposite the
entrance to the tomb chamber, opens into a corridor which
runs south past a staircase to the upper floor (see below) to
emerge at the north-west corner of the courtyard. At the north
end of the corridor there is a short westward extension giving
access to the western annex. A door in the north side of this
extension opens into a cross-vaulted room (marked ‘A’ on the
plan, fig.57.3) which has a window in its east wall overlooking
the terrace in front of the main entrance and a later window in
its north wall. A doorway in the west side of the corridor opens
into a passage leading west to the roof of the eastern part of the
Ablutions Place. From this passage room ‘B’ of the western
annex is entered, and room ‘C’ is reached through room ‘B’. A
door in the south wall of the passage opens into a small,
irregular room (D) with a door opening south to the roof of the
Ablutions Place (see plate 57.6).

The courtyard of the madrasa is now cluttered with an
assortment of piers and abutments which support cross vaults
carrying later structures. Originally the courtyard was
completely open to the sky. Its east wall is the Haram wall, at the
base of which the top ofan arch protrudes above the level of the
pavement (plate 57.10); its purpose is not known though it may
be connected with a gate passage, now a cistern, located by
Warren under the courtyard.”* A well-recess at the east end of
the south wall of the courtyard (plate 57.10) allowed water to
be drawn from the cistern. The lower part of the recess is now
blocked up. The arch spanning the recess is distinctively
decorated with muqarnas elements carved on the voussoirs in
a manner reminiscent of the entrance to the Basitiyya (no. 53).
A billet moulding adorns the extrados of the arch.

In the middle of the south wall a pointed-arched opening
into the ‘lower mosque’ is blocked up (plate 57.11). A modern
 Staircase now rises across that blocked opening. The mosque
itself is inaccessible as a result, but a black and white ablaq
mibrab in its south wall was seen from the adjoining Baladiyya
Madrasa (above, p. 451).

Directly opposite the blocked archway in the south wall,
two vertical breaks in the masonry of the north wall of the
courtyard indicate that there was once an opening there. Traces
of a mugqarnas springer at the western break (plate 57.12)
show that the opening must have been arched. It was
presumably an arched recess like a shallow iwan echoing the
archway in the south wall (as indicated by dotted lines on the
plan, fig. 57.3). Fig. 57.10 is a sketch of how the north side of the
courtyard might originally have looked. On the right-hand
(east) side of the arched recess a rectangular recess contains
the blocked window of the tomb chamber, which is partly
concealed by a later vault over this end of the courtyard.

The west wall of the courtyard is too much rebuilt and
encumbered with later structures for any clear impression of its
original form to emerge. It was here, presumably, that several
of the items listed in the 1066/1656 document, such as the
kitchen and cooking ranges, were situated. It is impossible to

tell whether or not these formed part of the Original
foundation.
 UPPER FLOOR (fig. 57.5)

The original staircase to the upper floor must be the one
entered from the corridor between the entrance vestibule and
the courtyard. A locked door at the bottom of the stairs
prevented us from surveying this area. All we can say is that after
rising towards the west the stairs must have turned east and
emerged in a corridor passing eastward above the southern
side of the tomb chamber. On the way, the stairs will have given
access to upper rooms and roofs on the west and south sides of
the courtyard and to the mezzanine room above the entrance
vestibule, which was lit by the high window visible in the
entrance portal.”

The corridor led to a door Opening into the north-west
 corner of the assembly hall. The assembly hall is effectively
divided by a modern partition wall into two parts, northern and
southern. The northern part and the ‘loggia’ and another room
to the north of it were all inaccessible to us, and our description
of them is based on an unpublished survey made in 1979 by the
Department of Islamic Archaeology, which that department
kindly made available to us. We were able to reach the southern
part by way of an archway in the west wall of room 'F’.

All rooms at this level appear to have been reached only by
way of the assembly hall. A door in its north wall, beside the
entrance from the staircase, opens into a square room roofed
by a folded cross vault. Originally there was a dome resting on
an eight-sided drum at the apex of the vault (see above, p. 548).
This room we call a loggia for it enjoys a wonderful view of the
Haram through the splendid double-arched window in its east
 wall. A small window at the north end of its west wall overlooks
the street. In the middle of its north wall is a door into room ‘E’,
the distinctive vaulting of which appears to have been rebuilt,
possibly in the Ottoman period. This room has two windows in
its east wall overlooking the Haram, one in its west wall
overlooking the street, and one in its north wall onto the roof
of the Haram portico. If the original foundation extended
northwards, as it may have done (see above, p. 547), then there
would have been a door in this north wall.

The northern part of the assembly hall is roofed by a cross
vault and lit by a high-level slit window above the entrance door
in its west wall. The assembly hall was divided into two bays by
a wide arch resting on two re-used marble columns with
Crusader bases and thick-leaf capitals. The archway is now
blocked. Beyond it lies the southern part of the assembly hall,
roofed by a folded cross vault rising to a dome on an eight-
sided drum with windows in each side (see above). It is lit also
by two rectangular windows surmounted by a central slit in the
east wall, overlooking the Haram, and by a rectangular window
surmounted by a slit in the middle of its west wall. At the south
end of the west wall a new door has been opened in the corner
of the hall. The south, gibla wall contains a simple mibrab
beside which is a cupboard on the left and a door on the right
(plate 57.13). These openings have curious double pseudo-
relieving arches that contrive to give the impression of
concentrating load on the lintels at mid-span (see fig. 57.8).
One course above these pseudo-relieving arches a frieze of
mugqarnas niches extends across the wall, rising as a
rectangular frame above the mibrab. The wall is built of red and
cream-coloured ablagq, now painted with whitewash. Between
the vertical sides of the muqgarnas frieze a course of joggling
extends above the keystone of the mhrab arch and, above that,
asunken panel with decoratively cusped ends is inscribed with
the first words of Koran ix, 18: ‘Only he shall inhabit God’s
places of worship who believes in God and the Last Day’.

The door to the right of the mibrab leads into room ‘F’,
which is roofed by a cross vault at the west end and by an
octagonal domical vault at the east end; a transverse arch spans
the room between the two vaults. A window in the east wall
overlooks the Haram, while one in a recess in the south wall is
presumably a later insertion since it opens onto the north zwvdn
 of the adjoining Ashrafiyya Madrasa. An archway in the west wall
(now partly blocked) opens into a modern room to the west.
This archway may once have opened into some earlier
structure on the roof of the lower mosque from where water
drawn from the cistern (see above) could have been
distributed.

29 The document cited on P. 546 above makes it clear that by 1066/1656 there
were buildings at this level on both the west and south sides of the courtyard.
Whether or not they belonged to the original construction is not known, but there
must originally have been something on the roof at the south end of the courtyard
for the well recess described above has a chimney-like shaft above it that was
intended to permit water to be drawn from the cistern to that upper level.

The site is bounded to the south by the street, Tariq Bab al-

complex of uncertain date (see below).

A recessed entrance portal leads from the street into a

elaborately vaulted porch leads south to the main hall. In the
south-west corner of the courtyard a vaulted staircase leads past
a mezzanine room to the upper floor.

On the upper floor two galleries give access to the upper
tiers of cells on either side of the courtyard. At the south end of
the courtyard there is an open terrace separated from the street
by the dome of the main hall, the mezzanine and another room.
At the east end of the terrace a second staircase leads up to
where a loggia and assembly hall (with a mibrab) formerly
stood on the roof of the Haram portico. Alongside that staircase
a short passage runs east to an inner court enclosed by a
‘middle zwén’ and various other chambers on the roof of the
antechamber and main hall and of the Ribat of Kurt. One of
these chambers, above the south-west corner of the courtyard
of the ribat, may originally have contained a staircase down to
a group of largely ruined buildings at the south end of that
courtyard. These buildings may have formed part of the
Jawhariyya. We know that the builders of the Jawhariyya had
access to the ribat for they erected a buttress in the middle of its
main hall to support the south wall of the inner court on the
floor above.

The street facade of the Jawhariyya follows roughly the
alignment of the adjoining facade of the Ribat of Kurt. The main
axis of the Jawhariyya courtyard is, however, more or less
parallel with the Haram wall, and the discrepancy in the
alignments has had to be compensated for in the plan, notably
by making the north wall of the main hall taper from west to
east (see plan).

The plain facade of the building to the west of the
Jawhariyya affords no useful clues as to its date. It is conceivably
to be associated with an institution called the ‘Ribat of the
 Sultan’ which, according to an Ottoman summary of the
Jawhariyya waqf (see below), was adjacent to the Jawhariyya.

In addition to many later accretions, the building has been
refurbished twice in recent years. Most of the eastern rooms
were braced with an unsightly reinforced concrete wainscoting
following subsidence in 1971 when a tunnel was driven along
the west wall of the Haram. The street facade and parts of the
interior were rebuilt and repaired in 1982-83.

IDENTIFICATION

Mujir al-Din is brief and to the point: ‘The Jawhariyya Madrasa
is in the Bab al-Hadid street and partly built over the Ribat of
Kurt. It was endowed by al-Safawi Jawhar, the Steward of the
Royal Harem, in the year 844 [1440-41]. The building is on the
north side of the street and at one time was fully identified by a
foundation inscription over the entrance. The original text was
edited by van Berchem (see below), but sadly it was destroyed
in the interval between his visits to Jerusalem in 1893 and 1914.

DATE
A translation of the lost inscription’? is all that is required:

In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate.
{Koran xxx, 49 as far as mawtibd, ‘its death’). The order to
construct this blessed madrasa and the ribat, from the
bounty bestowed by God Almighty, was given by the
servant needful of God Almighty, Jawhar al-Qunuqbayi,
the Treasurer and the Steward of the Royal Harem, the
servant of al-Malik al-Zahir, and the Chief Shaykh of the
Servitors of the Noble Sanctuary of the Prophet, in his
desire for the gracious countenance of God. The
construction was completed on the first day of Rajab the
Unique in the year eight hundred and forty-four [26
November 1440].

FOUNDER

Jawhar? was an Abyssinian eunuch, part of a gift from a ruler of
Abyssinia to Sultan Barquq, who presented him to the Amir
Qunugbay al-Ilja’'i, the /4/a (tutor) of the Sultan’s son, al-Nasir
Muhammad. In this amir’s Service Jawhat was freed, and he had
a number of other masters‘ before he attached himself to the

7S a ie) Pee is Ye be Ete) be eo es His ota

Dy ale he 9 pipeory Ge gay
 service he prospered till ‘Alam al-Din’s death in 826/1423.°

After a period of unemployment Jawhar sprang with one
bound into high office, to serve as al-Ashraf_ Barsbay’s
Treasurer, in Dhu'l-Hijja 83 1\/September 1428,° on the
recommendation of a namesake, Jawhar the Tutor,’ In this post
Jawhar al-Qunuqbayi became very influential and successfully
abetted the sultan in his policy of squeezing the merchant class.
Judgements upon him are mixed, tending towards the critical.
At worst he is accused of far-reaching financial corruption. By
the end of his life he had amassed about fifty sources of income,
fiefs, rents and pensions.®

He continued in this office beyond the death of Barsbay
and into the reign of al-Zahir Jaqmaq — hence the ‘servant of al-
Malik al-Zahir’ in the inscription — by whom he was made
Steward of the Harem (26 Shawwal 842/11 April 1439)? By
Rajab 844/November-December 1440 Jawhar was seriously ill,
 and he died on the eve of Monday, 1 Sha‘ban of that year/26
December, one month after the completion of his madrasa in
Jerusalem. He was about seventy years of age. Jaqmaq seized
the extensive properties of Jawhar, perhaps even some of the
waqfs,'° since the historian al-‘Ayni writes that ‘his madrasa
remained devoid of shaykh and students’, although the
madrasa to which al-‘Ayni refers is the one built by Jawhar in
Cairo adjacent to the Azhar."" This was where Jawhar was

buried, although the madrasa was not quite finished at his
death.

ENDOWMENT

Although Mujir al-Din said that the endowment was made in
844/1440-41, the Defter no. 522,!? in its entry for what it calls the
Khanqah of Jawhar, gives the date of the wagfiyya as 843/1439-
40. The properties given in endowment were as follows:
 Thus in the second half of the sixteenth century the total
income was 15,922 aspers. Defter no. 602,’ dated 990/1572,
gives the income of the properties, in the order above, as 3,996,
2,500, 4,035, 5,570, that is, in total, 16,101 aspers.

An entry in the Jerusalem Court sijills’? provides a copy of
a central mufassal register, dated after 1000/1591, and most
probably the 1005/1596-97 register.'° The date of the wagfiyya
is confirmed but most interestingly a summary of the original
waqf instrument is given, the main provisions made by Jawhar
for what is again referred to as his khanqah. The details of the
financial arrangements were as follows:
 "
61,"Position, etc.
","The post of inspector (vdzir) he reserved for himself
during his lifetime. His freed men were to succeed him in
order of maturity and competence (al-arshad fa'l-arshad), and
the last one was to appoint the person of his own choice in
consultation with the Shafi‘'i Qadi of Jerusalem. There was to be
a shaykh’’ in charge of 25 Siifis (min abl al-kbayr, pious
persons), who were to gather daily to perform the Sufi office
(wazifat al-tasawwuf), recite passages from the Koran and
pray. There was also provision for a ‘shaykh of the orphans’, to
act as teacher for ten orphans, who were to attend the khanqah
daily to study the Koran.'* Another member of the staff was to
be a hdfiz, i.e. one who knew the Koran by heart, to teach
(mulaggin) in the khanqah. This was presumably at a higher
level than the teaching of the orphans, and perhaps the first
holder of the post was Shams al-Din Muhammad b. Khalil b. Abi
Bakr al-Qabaqabi al-Shafi‘l (777-849/1375-1445), who was ‘to
give instruction in the textual variants of the Koran in the
Jawhariyya Madrasa (sic). He was followed by his son, Burhan
al-Din Ibrahim, who was still alive when Mujir al-Din was
writing,

In addition to the normal complement of administrative
 personnel and the special provision for oil for lighting and a
general one for the purchase of mats, other furnishings and
lamps, as and when needed, a small daily allowance of bread
was made for ‘the widows in retreat (al-mujdwirdt) in the Ribat
of the Sultan adjacent to the Khangah’. The occurrence of the
term ‘ribat’ in the foundation inscription does not explain this
provision. There, the term seems to mean ‘establishment for
Sifis’, which fits well with the details of the wagfiyya copy and
the description of the building as a khanqah. The mention of
widows suggests a hospice. Jawhar probably did not intend that
this part of his endowment be distributed in the nearby royal
hospice, the Ribat al-Mansiri. There was a hospice for women
in the Bab al-Hadid district. Sijill 30, no. 1302 contains the list of
effects of a woman who died there in 962/1555. This may well
have been the same as ‘the Sultan’s Hospice’, which was distinct
from the Hospice of al-Mansiir (see pp. 129 and 145).

The final thing to note is that any excess income was to be
distributed among the founder’s freedmen (‘utaqa’) and their
descendants.”°
The annual bill would thus be 9,540 dirhams, and if we add in
the extra for Ramadan lighting, 9,600. For 360 days the total of
bread distributed would come to 11,220 Jerusalem rotls.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY
The Jawhariyya was likely to be used to house important visitors
to Jerusalem judging from two occasions, first when the wakil
al-sultan, the trading agent of the sultan, came in Ramadan 875/
March 1471,” and secondly when one of the two gadis, sent
from Cairo in 880/1475-76 to look into the dispute over a
demolished synagogue, received a delegation of Jews in the
Jawhariyya where he was staying.”

The highly respected Shaykh Kamal al-Din b. Abi Sharif
was commissioned by royal decree towards the end of 900/
autumn 1495 to exercise responsibility for the Jawhariyya, as
also in the Salahiyya Madrasa. Quite clearly, from the context of
our source, it was intended that he should carry out reforms.”°
It is possible that by this time the line of waqf overseers from
amongst the first generation freedmen of the founder had
come to an end. Certainly, by the middle of the tenth/sixteenth
century, and still in 988/1580, the post of overseer was in the
hands of three generations of the Ibn al-Muhandis family.”’

At times there were difficulties in obtaining the revenues.
In Ramadan 962/November 1554 Sa‘d al-Din Muhammad b. al-
Muhandis complained to the court that for the three previous
years he had received no payments of revenue from the people
of Taqu‘.” He and other members of the family appear to have
operated the Jawhariyya on surprising deficits. A
comprehensive account of expenditure for the years 975-81/
1567-73,”° shows that 7,156 paras were spent on the stipends of
officials (including 4,700 for the overseer). Twenty-three Koran
readers (qurra’)° — these are the twenty-five Sufis of the
wagfiyya metamorphosed! — received in all 2,201 paras.
General expenses amounted to the large sum of 17,688 paras,**
and there was a sum of 120 paras owed by the 7dzir of Ribat
Kurt for ground rent. The total expenditure was 27,165 paras,
an excess of 9,800 over income. A continuation of the account
makes plain the extent of the indebtedness of the wadf. In the
period 954-81/1547-74 the Ibn al-Muhandis overseers had
provided from their own resources (including the 9,800
mentioned above) 35,258 paras. The repayments from the
waqf in that period totalled only 12,080, which meant that the
debt to the family was 23,178! paras, or a little over eight times
the average income for the six previous years.*? Nearly half of
the debt was accounted for by 10,000 paras provided by the
overseer in 954/1547 to repair the damage caused to the
Khangah (sic) by the major earthquake of 952-3/1540.
 In 1093/1681 the mutawalli was again reporting* that the
‘madrasa’ was in a ruined state. The cost of the needful repairs
were estimated at 361 piastres and 5 paras. A ‘screen’ (sitara)
was proposed for the ‘lower iwéin’, which is described as ‘the
place for the reading of the Tradition of the Prophet’, to prevent
unauthorised access. Other features of the building mentioned
are the mosque (jai), the loggia (qam4ri), with a view of the
Haram, a central (wastdni) iwdn, kitchen, a small room
overlooking the Ribat Kurt, and the passage connecting with
the upper parts and the madrasa’s jami‘via a stone staircase.
 "
61,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","STREET FACADE (fig. 58.7)

The street facade is on two levels: the main facade to the left
(west) of the Ribat of Kurt; and an upper storey facade above the
Ribat (plate 58.1). The continuity of masonry where the two
parts of the facade overlap shows that they belong to the same
construction. The structure above the upper storey is a later,
Ottoman addition.

The upper storey facade contains three windows. The
easternmost is plain. The other two are decorated both
differently and in an unusual manner. The right-hand one
(plate 58.2) is set in a shallow recess with a sloping sill and
three tiers of muqarnas corbelling at the head. It retains its
original iron grille. The lower part of the stone above the lintel
is incised to a depth of about 0.02m with a curious fretwork
design. Above that, a circle of reddish stones surrounds a
roundel made up of six skew-faceted voussoirs (one of which
is now missing) carved with a chevron moulding» The left-
hand window (plate 58.3) has a sort of hoodmould that runs
vertically up on either side and continues horizontally over the
lintel. This moulding is embellished with an incised
diaperwork pattern of intersecting triangles: a feature observed
earlier on mouldings at the Ghadiriyya (no. 54) and the
‘Uthmaniyya (no. 57). Above the middle of the horizontal run of
the hoodmould a circular boss links it with a similarly
embellished moulding encircling a chevron roundel identical
to the one over the right-hand window.

The main ground-floor facade was restored in 1982-83.
Our description deals with the facade as it was before the
restoration, when it retained more of the original masonry.
The centrepiece of this facade is a recessed entrance portal
(plate 58.4). To the left of the portal is a high-level pointed-
arched window surmounted by a small rectangular window,
which appears to be a later insertion. To the right of the portal
is a group of three windows, of which the lower two were
originally a matching pair. The third window, placed above the
lower pair, is obviously a later intrusion, The left-hand lower
window retains its original configuration of red and cream-
coloured ablag jambs and lintel set in a shallow recess spanned
by three tiers of rectilinear muqarnas corbelling. The adjacent
 These are some arrangements made for lands of the waqfs. The first is an jjara, and the others muqata‘a contracts.
 window must have been identical, but its corbelling was
plundered to decorate the improvised window above and
replaced by a crude arch.

The horseshoe-arched recess of the entrance portal is
constructed of red and cream-coloured ablaq masonry
enclosed by a quirked ogee frame moulding. Stone benches,
framed by an extension of the same moulding, flank the
doorway. The red monolithic lintel is slightly recessed within a
quadrant chamfer border. One course above the lintel is the
effaced inscription panel, also slightly recessed, which is
decorated with trilobed ends. Above that panel a small double-
arched window, supported in the centre by a marble shaft,
pierces the tympanum of the portal arch.

A billet moulding forms a cornice over this facade. (A
similar moulding that may once have crowned the upper storey
facade now graces the Ottoman structure above it.) A rubble
wall and half-arch above the lower facade are modern.

During restoration work done in 1982 the inscription
panel, composed of four separate marble slabs, was
dismantled. It was then discovered that the back of one of the
slabs bore an earlier inscription containing a royal cartouche in
the name of Sultan Faraj ibn Barqiig. It commemorates the
renewal (jaddada/juddida) of an otherwise unknown water
trough (hawd) some time in the first decade of the ninth/
fifteenth century (the date is not quite clear).
 GROUND FLOOR (pian, fig. 58.3)

The double entrance doors open into a cross-vaulted vestibule,
from which further doors open in the west, east and north
sides. The west one leads into a small, unlit barrel-vaulted
chamber (A) with a stone bench against its east wall, perhaps
intended for the bawwdab. The door in the east side opens in a
shallow recess with a cavetto moulding across the top: a special
emphasis because it serves the main hall of the madrasa. To the
north a doorway leads from the vestibule through a short
passage into an iwédn-like vault (R) which opens for its full
width on the courtyard (plate 58.5). In the west wall of this vault
a segmental-arched doorway gives access by way of a small
lobby to a windowless cell (C) to the west, and a large vaulted
hall (B) to the south, which is lit by high-level windows in its
south and west walls.

Beside vault ‘R’ a staircase in the south-west corner of the
courtyard leads to the upper floors (see below). On the other
side of the vault ‘R’ a similar zvdn-like vault (Q) formed a porch
(now blocked) in front of the principal entrance to the main
hall. A door in its east wall leads into a cell (P), now filled with
rubble. Some indication of the particular importance of the
main hall is given by the elaborate vaulting of this porch (see
plan, fig. 58.3, and plate 58.6), and by the decoration of the door
into the hall, which is framed by a quirked ogee moulding and
has a lintel with a convex top surface (reminiscent of that of the
entrance to the ‘Uthmaniyya) surmounted by a relieving arch of
simply joggled ablaq voussoirs (see plate 58.6).

The main hall has undergone various transformations,
including the insertion of an extra window in the south wall
(see above), the addition of a reinforced concrete wainscoting
and, most notably, the introduction of a later vault separating
the hall from its original dome (see section, fig. 58.8).

The open courtyard of the madrasa is unusually long,
though this is no longer appararent since a modern double
staircase now divides it. Pointed-arched doors (some of which
have been given flat lintels in recent times) in the east and west
sides of the courtyard open into ten barrel-vaulted cells, five on
each side (D-H and L-P). (Two of the cells on the east side are
now inaccessible.) The northernmost door on the east side is
blocked; a former tenant of the building described it as a
passage (K) leading to the adjoining building (i.e. the courtyard
of the Ribat of Kurt).

At the north end of the courtyard is a cross-vaulted iwdn,
now partitioned off (see plate 58.7). A door and window in the
east wall of the iwdén open to a small room (J), roofed by twin
 cross vaults. A room (I) to the west of the ivan is now quite

inaccessible — the former tenant told us that it contains a well-
head.

UPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 58.4)

The staircase at the south-west corner of the courtyard (plate
58.8) rises under a corbelled barrel vault up to a landing lit
from the north by a high-level window (plate 58.9). A short
passage leads south from this landing to the door into a vaulted
mezzanine room (A?), which is lit by the double-arched
window (plate 58.10) in the tympanum of the entrance portal.
Opposite that window a chimney-like recess (now blocked) in
the north wall seems to be designed to provide cross-
ventilation.

From the first landing three steps rise east to a second
landing, from where a further four steps lead north up to an
open top landing. On the west side of the top landing a barrel-
vaulted chamber (D?) opens like a diminutive ivan (see plate
58.11). A door in the south wall of this chamber leads into a tiny
room (C’), which now houses a privy.

North from the top landing three steps descend toa gallery
along the west side of the courtyard. The parapet wall of this
gallery appears to be modern, as do all parapet and screen walls
at this level. The gallery gives access to a range of five cells (E-
I’). The common wall of two of the cells (G? and H?) has been
removed, the vault renewed, and a double window inserted in
place of the door of ‘H”. At the north end of the gallery a
staircase leads up to the roofs of the cells and of the north iwédn,
which now supports a modern dwelling house. Beyond the
staircase a short passage alongside the vault of the zwan leads
to two small rooms (J* and K’). A strange object beside the
entrance to ‘K” (see plan, fig. 58.4) looks as if it might be a
hollow column base through which water could have been
drawn from the well said to be in the blocked room (I) below.

From the landing at the head of the main stairs, three steps
lead east up to an irregular terrace at the south end of the
courtyard. In the south-west corner of this terrace a door leads
down two steps into a low, vaulted room (B?) lit by a (later)
window opening on the street and another opening to the west.
On the south side of the terrace a door opens into a queer stone
‘igloo’ that is actually the interior of the dome over the main
hall, now separated from it by a later floor. The interior of the
dome is plastered. The plain exterior is paved like the rest of
the roofs (see roof plan, fig. 58.6).

Opposite the door into the dome there will once have

 been six steps down to a gallery that runs north on the east side
of the courtyard to give access to six cells (M?-R?) and, at the
north end, a short corridor to a seventh cell (L?). The party walls
between five of the cells (N7-R?) now contain Openings, but
these must be later insertions. At the south end of the gallery
some modern outhouses replace the steps down from the
terrace. The extension of the gallery to oversail the courtyard is
recent, as are the stairs at the north end which lead up to two
modern apartments over this east range of cells.

At the east end of the terrace an archway opens into a
barrel-vaulted staircase which originally led to an assembly hall
and loggia over the Haram portico (see below).

Next to that archway is a short passageway which, though
now blocked except for a window, seems originally to have
given access to a small inner court enclosed by those rooms
that are located on the roof of the Ribat of Kurt. The first of these
rooms is to the south: a cross-vaulted iwan, evidently the one
referred to in a document dated 1093/1681 (see above) as the
‘middle iwan’. Its frontal arch (see plate 58.12) is decorated in
a unique fashion with paired convex gadroons alternating with
single concave ones, all framed by a hoodmould with
ornamental ‘dog-tooth’ emargination of the inner edge. The
arch is blocked by a modern partition containing a door and
two windows. A window in the rear (south) wall of the zwvan
overlooks the street. East of the zvdn three steps lead up from
the court to a plain door into room ‘Y”, which is roofed by a
folded cross vault and a deep barrel-vaulted recess to the east.
It is lit by two windows overlooking the street. In the middle of
 the west wall a door (now blocked) connected the room to the
middle zwan. A door at the east end of the inner court opens
into a cross-vaulted room (W*), which has a window
overlooking the courtyard of the Ribat of Kurt to the north.

Two arched recesses (U? and V*) open in the north side of
the court, under the staircase to the assembly hall and loggia.
Both are now partly blocked by thin partitions. A door in the
rear wall of the east recess leads north down four steps to a
barrel-vaulted chamber (T?). This chamber is linked to the
adjoining cell (R*) by a wide opening — presumably a later
breach — in the east wall of that cell. The east end of chamber
‘T” is open, now leading into a flimsy modern appendage to the
east. To the north of ‘T” a door opens into a narrow, barrel-
vaulted chamber (S?) lit by a slit in its east wall. It is impossible
now to be sure that these chambers ‘T”’ and ‘S”’ belong to the
original construction. They sit directly above the antechamber
to the main hall of the Ribat, and it is quite likely that they were
built at the same time. We have suggested above (p. 148) that
the antechamber and ancillary structures at the south end of the
Ribat’s courtyard were added by the builders of the Jawhariyya.
If so, we should expect there to have been some means of
communication between them and the rest of the Jawhariyya.
That might have been achieved by the provision of a stairway
from the now ruined passageway alongside the north wall of
the antechamber (see plan, fig. 58.3) up to ‘S” and from there
by way of ‘T” to the inner court. The structures at ground floor
level are too dilapidated and overlaid with debris (see plate
7.5) to reveal any trace of such a stairway.
 ASSEMBLY HALL AND LOGGIA

The barrel-vaulted staircase at the east end of the upper floor
terrace leads up to a group of rooms (A*-C’) that are plainly of
Ottoman construction. Originally the stairs will have led onto
the roof of ‘W” and from there through a door in the upper
Haram wall to the assembly hall and loggia on the roof of the
Haram portico. These are listed as a ja@mi‘and a qamdri in the
1093/1681 document cited above (p. 558). Salzmann’s 1854
photograph and Bedford’s 1862 one (plates 63.13 and 35.5)
show the remains of the triple-bayed assembly hall with a
mibrab in its south wall above this section of the Haram portico.
The anteroom of the assembly hall of the Muzhiriyya lay to the
south (see below, p. 584). This section of portico was
demolished and rebuilt in 1928.*° The loggia, which had a view
of the Haram according to the document mentioned above,
 must have been to the north of the assembly hall. Only slight
traces of its west wall survive. And all that now remains of the
assembly hall is part of its west wall containing a grilled window
(now blocked) overlooking the steet. This window opens
directly above the Haram gate, Bab al-Hadid (plate 58.13). On
the exterior it has jambs of red and greyish ablaq set in a
shallow recess with a distinctive pointed arch of chevron
voussoirs — a treatment more commonly associated with
Crusader architecture, though other examples occur in a
Mamluk context at the entrance to the Turba of Barka Khan (no.
2) (where it may be in secondary use) and at the well-head of
the Is‘ardiyya (no. 33).°” The remains of a billet cornice similar
to the one over the street facade survive above the window (see
plate 58.13).

7 One must be careful to distinguish the careers of these two Jawhars. Both were
called Safi al-Din (or al-Safawi in the formal style of the inscription), both were
Abyssinian and both held the same offices at different times. Their close
cooperation is suggested by a joint purchase of property from the State Treasury
and the subsequent establishing of it as waqf in late 833 and early 834/1430-31
(Amin, Catalogue, no. 89). Jawhar al-Qunuqbayi made a waqf acting as executor

17 Possibly the first shaykh was Shams al-Din Muhammad b. Muhassin b. Hasan
al-Hanafi, who died soon after 852/1449 (Mujir, ii, 225). His successor was Shams
al-Din Muhammad b. Hasan b. Da’td b. al-Nasiri al-Shafi‘, born c.800/1397 (Mujir,
ii, 190).

18 An early holder of this office was a certain Shams al-Din Muhammad b.
Muhammad b. Ghadiya al-Hanafi, who was also a muezzin in the Aqsa and died in
800/1475-6 (Muir, ii, 233). His father was Hanafi deputy Qadi in Jerusalem and his
son a Sh&fi7 faqih in the Salahiyya (Mujir, ii, 224 and 194). Note that in 983/1575
the teacher of the orphans was a Misa b. Ghadiya (Sijill 56, 604).

62,"I LOCATION (fig. 59.1)
","Opposite the main (south) entrance to the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre, at the east end of the court of the Mosque of al-Afdal
‘All.
 "
62,"II SITE AND BUILDING
","The mosque to which the minaret is attached was founded by
Salddin’s son, al-Malik al-Afdal ‘Ali, in 589/1193! in a corner of
the Crusader hospital of the Knights of St John. Mujir al-Din
(see below) states that the minaret attached to that mosque
appears to be built on older foundations. The lower part of the
base is now enclosed by later structures but, above these, it can
be seen to incorporate large quantities of Crusader masonry,
some of which may be i7 situ.

The minaret is of the usual ‘Syrian tower’ type, square in
plan. It consists of a tall base, above which the shaft is divided
into three ‘storeys’ by mouldings. The muezzin’s gallery is
octagonal in plan as is the lantern, which is surmounted bya
circular drum and bulbous dome (plate 59.1).
 "
62,"Il HISTORY
","Mujir al-Din informs us that the minaret attached to the Mosque
of al-Afdal ‘Ali, which is south of and opposite the Church of the
 Holy Sepulchre, was renewed some time before 870/1465 and
appears to have been built on old foundations.”

It has been suggested that the minaret was rebuilt
following the earthquake of 863/1458, which is known to have
damaged a nearby minaret.’ However, the decoration of the
minaret shares many of the features of the Salahiyya Minaret
(no. 52), which Mujir al-Din dates before 820/1417-18.
Common features are: cavetto mouldings with repeating
mugqarnas, billet mouldings and skew-faceted roundels. The
muezzin’s galleries and their superstructures are virtually
indentical. This makes it tempting to suppose that the two
minarets are more or less contemporaneous, but in the
absence of more concrete evidence it may be wiser to adopt
Mujir al-Din’s dating ‘before 870’ (1465-66).

In the Ottoman period the Mosque of al-Afdal ‘Ali became
associated with ‘Umar b. al-Khattab and was called Jami‘
‘Umar’‘ A recently painted sign over the outer entrance calls it
Masjid “Umar b. al-Khattab.
 "
62,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","Where visible above encroaching buildings the masonry of the
lower part of the base appears to be earlier than that above. On
the south face (plate 59.2) this masonry is skewed back in order
to clear a window (now blocked) in a wall that runs south from
the base of the minaret. This wall must be a Crusader or earlier
construction since it contains an engaged column supporting
vault and arch springings which are obviously remains of some
Crusader building. We can safely assume, therefore, that this
part of the base is post-Crusader. The north-west corner of the
base is composed entirely of Crusader stones, many of which
bear masons’ marks. While it is a question whether these stones
are in situ or not, it is important to note that they include a fine
moulding that runs continuously up the north face in what
seems to be undisturbed Crusader masonry (see plate 59.3). If
that masonry is indeed undisturbed it would have appealed to
the builders of the minaret as solid foundation.’

The base of the minaret is bevelled twice on the east face
and once on the west face to reduce its plan form to a square.
Apart from dish-shaped roundels in the north and south faces
(see plates 59.2 and 59.3) and a plain projecting roundel like a
protruding column drum in the north face, the base is
undecorated.

From the Crusader column mentioned above a half-arch
spans northwards to provide a bridge giving access to a door in
the south face of the base (see plate 59.2). This door opens on
a staircase rising within the core of the shaft to the muezzin’s
gallery.

A cyma recta moulding divides the base from the first
storey, which has pointed horseshoe-arched recesses
 containing slit windows in all four sides. The voussoirs of the
arches are of greyish and cream-coloured ablaq, framed by a
billet moulding which extends around the shaft at the level of
the springing of the arches. The typanums of the arches are
inscribed with Koranic verses® (plate 59.4). Above the recess in
the south side is a sundial, now very badly worn and lacking its
gnomon (plate 59.5), which could have been read from the
bridge to the entrance door.

A cavetto moulding carved with a repeating muqgarnas
motif divides the first storey from the second. The second
storey also has window recesses in all four sides. Those in the
east and west sides are spanned by double arches supported on
a central column. The recesses in the north and south sides
contain paired slit windows and have mugarnas heads, now
much damaged. The recess in the south side is further
embellished with nook-shafts in the jambs.

A shallow moulding, similar in profile to the one framing
the lintels on the facade of the Almalikiyya (see p. 311 above),
divides the second storey from the third. Little diamond-shaped
windows pierce all four sides of the shaft at this level. Above
each of them is a roundel composed like the ones on the facade
of the Jawhariyya (above, p. 558) of six skew-faceted voussoirs,
alternately red and cream-coloured, carved with a zig-zag and
surrounded by a billet moulding.

Above the third storey the muezzin’s gallery is carried by
three roll corbels on each side. Recesses with pointed arches
composed of gadrooned voussoirs open in all eight sides of the
lantern. Those on the cardinal axes contain openings: small
windows in the north, west and south sides and a door in the
east side. A continuous billet moulding frames the extrados of
the arches.

","At the south-end of the west side of Dome of the Rock terrace,
at the head of the stairway nearly opposite Bab al-Silsila.
 "
63,"II SITE AND BUILDING
","Mujir al-Din recounted that before the present stairway was
built there was a narrow vaulted stairway called the Lane of
Kissing (zugqaq al-bis) that led up from the Haram esplanade to
the Dome of the Rock terrace.! Al-‘Umari describes that earlier
stairway as a vaulted passage with seventeen steps, each step 1
dhira’ (approximately 0.70m) in width, through which one
descends to the lower part of the Haram? This narrow and
dubiously-named passage would hardly have been regarded as
a suitable means of approach from the main gate of the Haram,
Bab al-Silsila, to the Dome of the Rock, However, it was not until
after construction of the initial Ashrafiyya to the north of Bab al-
Silsila had been completed in 875/1470 (see below, p. 591) that
the passage was replaced by the present steps and colonnade.

The colonnade follows the general form of the earlier
Mamluk colonnades at the north end of the Dome of the Rock
terrace (nos. 16 and 17), comprising a triple-arched arcade
carried on two columns and two masonry piers.
 "
63,"Il HISTORY
","An inscription on two marble plaques on the east face of the
arcade records that:

... this blessed stairway was constructed in the reign of...
al-Malik al-Ashraf . . . Qaytbay . . . that was achieved during
the superintendency of. . . Muhammad, Superintendent of

the Two Harams ... in the month of Jumada I of the year
877 (October 1472).. 3

The Superintendent Muhammad mentioned in the inscription
was Nasir al-Din Muhammad b. Nashashibi (see below, p. 591)
who, according to Mujir al-Din, had the earlier passage blocked
and the present stairway built on top of it, and a colonnade like
those at other stairways to the terrace erected in 877/1472 4
 "
63,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","The southern pier of the colonnade (plate 60.1) abuts on the
north-west corner of the Qubbat al-Nahwiyya, built in 604/
1207-8. The northern pier is substantially wider (north — south)
than the southern since it had to counteract any residual lateral
thrust from the arcade without the Support of an adjoining
structure. The present structure abutting on the northern pier
is a later (Ottoman) addition. A very shallow mibrab hollowed
out in the north face of the pier must also be a later addition for

its symmetrical placement takes account of that Ottoman
structure.
 The three pointed stilted arches of the arcade spring from
the two piers and two columns. The columns, with their
pedestals, bases and capitals, are obviously in secondary use.
No part of either column matches, the two being assembled
from a variety of components all apparently Byzantine in origin.
Above the capitals are abaci from which the arches spring. The
abaci are moulded to the same profile as a cornice moulding
around the piers at the same level.

The three arches are similar in height and span. The
middle arch is composed of alternately red and cream-
coloured ablagq voussoirs. The voussoirs of the outer arches are
gadrooned on both faces and on the soffits where the
gadrooning bends upwards in a series of chevrons (see plate
60.1). A cavetto moulding around the extradoses of the arches
continues at either end to form cornices on the piers. In the
spandrels of the middle arch are the two inscription plaques on
the east face, and on the west face (plate 60.2) two lozenge-
shaped recesses must once have contained some decorative
inlay, now missing. A cavetto cornice extends across the top of
the arcade. Above that a gabled coping sheds rainwater.

 "
64,"Il SITE AND BUILDINGS (fig. 61.2, 61.3 and 61.5)
","The tiny site on which the Ribat al-Zamani stands was, in part at
least, previously occupied by a hall that was a waqdf for the
Haram.' How it came to be acquired by Ibn al-Zamin, whether
by istibdal (waqf conversion), or by other means, is not
recorded. The site is bounded to the east by the Haram wall, to
the south by the lane Zuqiq Bab al-Mathara, to the west by
single-storey buildings inaccessible to us, which once housed
the women’s lavatory (see above, p. 544), and to the north by
Stq al-Qattanin.

The smallness of the site meant that to provide adequate
accommodation the building had to be laid out on several
floors. To the same end, three rooms of the southern lodgings
(rubi.’) of Siig al-Qattanin were incorporated into the ribat.

A tall entrance portal in the street facade opens into a
vestibule from which all parts of the building are reached.
These comprise two rooms and a passage on the ground floor,
with a staircase leading to a mezzanine and an upper floor.
Another stair leads from the upper floor to the roof of the
Haram portico where until 1927 stood various buildings, some
of which may have formed part of the ribat.
 "
64,"Ill HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

What Mujir al-Din refers to as the Zamani Ribat or pilgrim
hospice is situated according to him? ‘at the Gate of the
Ablutions Place, opposite the ‘Uthmaniyya Madrasa’ (see p.
544). The extant inscription on the building immediately to the
right, as one leaves the Haram by the above-mentioned gate,
provides positive identification. the inscription uses only the
neutral description ‘this blessed place’.

DATE

According to Mujir al-Din the date of the construction of the
ribat was the year 881/1476-773 This is confirmed by, indeed, it
may merely derive from, the inscription,‘ which reads as
follows:
In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate. This
blessed place was erected by the servant needful of God
Almighty, the Khwaja Shams al-Din Muhammad b. al-
Zamin, the servitor of the Noble Shrine of the Prophet
(upon its inmate be the best of blessings and greetings), in
the year eight hundred and eighty-one. May God bless our
Lord Muhammad and his family.
 FOUNDER

The founder named in the above inscription was described by
Mujir al-Din as ‘one of the courtiers (khawéass) of the Sultan al-
Malik al-Ashraf Qaytbay’. In another source we find him called
Muhammad b. ‘Umar, commonly known as Ibn al-Zamin, and
described as ‘the agent (wakil) and merchant (tajir) of the
sultan’? He makes a few appearances in the chronicles,
exclusively as a person commissioned by the sultan to carry out
certain buildings projects.

In 878/1473-74 the Sultan Qaytbay was informed of repair
works that were needed in the Prophet’s Mosque. Shams al-Din
Muhammad, who by that date had already built in Medina a
madrasa called the Zamaniyya, was entrusted with the task. He
came to Medina during 879/1474-75, made the necessary
arrangements and then returned to Egypt. Shams al-Din
Muhammad was later commissioned to do further work there.
He came from Jedda to Medina in Jumada I 881/August-
September 1476 and stayed to oversee things personally.° This
was the year in which own ribat in Jerusalem was completed. In
882/1477-78 Shams al-Din Muhammad was involved in a
disturbing incident in Medina, where he had been asked to
acquire a site for the construction of a madrasa for Qaytbay. He
had taken over the house of a Shi‘ite to incorporate it into the
new madrasa. The qadi, who allowed the demolition of the
house, was murdered. Ibn lyas was on pilgrimage that year and
witnessed these events.” The story is told differently (with no
mention of the dispute which ended in the murder of the qadi),
and an Amir Sunqur al-Jamali is named as intendant of the
works, by the historian, Qutb al-Din al-Nahrawali.® The latter
adds that the madrasa and a separate ribat too were completed
in 884/1479-80 by that same amir.

In 885/1480 Qaytbay ordered the repair of the Imam al-
Shafi'i’s Mausoleum in Cairo and appointed Shams al-Din
Muhammad to be the intendant (shaidd) of the works.’ The next
year, 886/1481, he was sent by the sultan to Medina once more
to effect a major re-building of the Holy Mosque, which had
been seriously damaged by a fire caused by lightning. He took
with him a number (some three hundred) of masons,
carpenters and workers in marble. The whole Operation was
not finished until the end of 887/early 1483 and cost the sultan
about 100,000 dinars."" The intendant is also said to have been
Jamal al-Din Sunqur al-Jamali, who was at that time engaged on

building work in Mecca! Under the year 897 Ibn Iyas gives the
following short notice:!2
 In Dhi'l-Qa‘da [September-October 1492] there came
from Mecca news of the death of the Khwaja Shams al- ie
Muhammad b. al-Zamin. He was a notable merchant,
known for his great wealth, and a man of piety and
beneficence. He was the founder of the madrasa in Bulaq'@
near the embankment (al-Rasif), a good and religious
man, in whom there was no harm.

The comprehensive entry given in  al-Sakhawi’s
biographical dictionary’ confirms and amplifies what has been
given above. Shams al-Din Muhammad b. ‘Umar b. al-Zamin al-
Qurashi al-Shafi‘T was born in Damascus in 824/1421, where he
did his early studies, and then followed his father into
commerce. His travels took him to Asia Minor and into the
Balkans, as far as Semendira (Semendria), when it was still a
Christian possession.'° He acquired a house in Egypt, and
having established an intimacy with Qaytbay, upon the latter's
accession to the sultanate, was appointed overseer of building
projects in Mecca. He had earlier performed a pilgrimage in
844/1441, and lived in Mecca on several different occasions. A
son, called Jamal al-Din Muhammad, whose mother was a slave-
girl, was born in Mecca in Muharram 883/April 1478.'’ Also
resident in Mecca was a nephew, Ibrahim b. ‘Abd al-Karim b.
‘Umar, who later married a daughter of Shams al-Din. It is
interesting to note that he too travelled in commerce, but
eastwards to the Malabar Coast. On the death of his uncle he
came back but then ‘returned with the seasonal convoy to
Dabhol’.'® Shams al-Din’s death followed several months of
 illness contracted in Mecca, where he had travelled to perform
the pilgrimage in 896/1491. He returned to Cairo in a litter and
died almost on his arrival, Sunday, 18 Shawwal 897/12 August
1492. The next day he was buried in his mausoleum.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

Two sijill entries give some details of repairs carried out on
what is referred to as the Zamaniyya Madrasa. They date from
982/1574 and 1093/1682.’ The first entry, which names the
administrator as Shams al-Din Muhammad b. ‘Afif al-Din
Muhammad b. Jaméa‘a al-Shafii, lists a schedule of repairs,
totalling 45 gold pieces, and mentions the following features of
the building: the lower kitchen, various cells (kbaldwi), ‘the
west Zwan in the south courtyard’, and ‘rooms at the door of the
assembly hall (majma’)’.

The later entry reports repairs effected by the
administrator of the Zamaniyya and the Khatiniyya, ‘Abd al-
Rahman Effendi b. Muhammad b. Muhammad al-‘Afifi al-Hanafi
(sic)° to both buildings. Those carried out in the Zamaniyya
were estimated to cost 245 piastres. The following elements in
the building were mentioned: the assembly hall and the eight
rooms within, the window (taqa) giving on to the Haram, five
‘south’ rooms in the western corridor (dibliz), an apartment
(tabaga) on the roof of the Khatiiniyya Madrasa and the dthliz
below, the zawiya of the madrasa (sic), the room overlooking
the Cotton-Merchants’ Gate, and the steps leading to the west
room of the women’s residence (dar al-harim).
 STREET FACADE (plate 61.1)

The street facade is dominated by a tall entrance portal (plate
61.2). To the left (west) of the portal the facade is plain except
for a trefoil-headed slit window anda large rectangular window
at ground floor level, and another rectangular window at upper
floor level. To the right of the portal an elaborately decorated
grilled window at ground floor level is surmounted by a plain
window at upper floor level (plate 61.2).

The juxtaposition of the principal features of the facade —
the portal and the decorated window — and the configuration of
the quirked ogee moulding that frames them were clearly
inspired by the facade of the ‘Uthmaniyya on the opposite side
of the street. In the ‘Uthmaniyya the aim of the designers was to
relate a window in the founder’s tomb to the entrance portal
containing the foundation inscription. In the Ribat al-Zamani,
on the other hand, there is no tomb and here the builders must
simply have copied what they saw as a successful design. The

details of construction are, however, different from those of the

‘Uthmaniyya and bear rather a strong resemblance to those of
the Muzhiriyya (no. 62), which was completed in 885/1480-81.

The masonry enclosed by the frame moulding is red and
cream-coloured ablaq. The entrance portal consists of a
shallow, trefoil-arched recess flanked by the usual stone
benches. Van Berchem’s photographs”! show that the doorway
was blocked up in 1914; it was repaired and reopened
 presumably during the 1920s at the same time as the facade of
the ‘Uthmaniyya was refurbished. The door has a curious disk
incised in the centre of its lintel. The inner suface of the disk is
less carefully finished than the rest of the lintel as if it were
intended to receive some kind of inlay, but no trace of such
exists. Two courses above the lintel a joggled string course (the
section above the door was replaced during the post-1914
repairs ) extends across the facade within the limits of the frame
moulding. The profile of the joggling over the door is different
from that over the window (see plate 61.2). Above the window
lintel the joggling is specially elaborate. If (as at the
‘Uthmaniyya) there was originally some similar elaboration
over the door, the repairs after 1914 have not preserved it. One
course above the joggled string course the foundation
inscription is carved on a sunken panel formed by an ornate
border of low-relief carving in the rear wall of the portal recess.
Towards the top of the recess a grilled rectangular window
lights an upper floor room (see below). This window is framed
by a low-relief border of stylized vine leaves and tendrils. From
one course above the sill of the window to the cusps where the
lobes of the trefoil arch meet, the recess is spanned by seven
tiers of mugarnas corbelling, all carved with arabesque tracery.
The top lobe of the trefoil is divided into three sectors, each
carved with arabesque tracery.

The grilled window” to the right of the portal is set in a
shallow recess spanned by four tiers of angular muqarnas
corbelling covered with arabesque tracery. Similar tracery
 decorates a pseudo-relieving lintel over the window and the
course of masonry immediately below the muqarnas
corbelling. The style of decoration, exemplified by the
Ashrafiyya (no. 63), is typical of Cairene Mamluk architecture
during and after the reign of Qaytbay.

GROUND FLOOR (plan, fig. 61.3)

The main rooms on the ground floor rise to the height of the
ceiling of the adjoining rbi‘ of Sig al-Qattanin to the north
(see section, fig. 61.6), evidently in order to provide a flat roof
on which the upper storey was built.

The first of these rooms is the entrance vestibule, roofed
by a folded cross vault in which an octagonal panel carved with
a strapwork star (plate 61.3) is recessed at the crown. A tall
archway in the east wall of the vestibule, now largely blocked to
leave only a rectangular window (see Jig. 61.6), opened into
what is architecturally the most important room (marked ‘A’ on
the plan). This, too, is roofed by a folded cross vault, which has
an octagonal dish decorated with a whirling rosette in plaster at
the crown (plate 61.4). In the south wall is the decorated
window that looks on the street. A door in the north wall leads
into room ‘B’. The cross vault of room ‘B’ rises to the same
height as the vaults of room ‘A’ and the vestibule, but a later
floor has at some time been inserted below it (see fig. 61.6).
Along with the door from room ‘A’ this room has a door (now
a window) in its east wall Opening under the Haram portico and
a door in its west wall Opening to a landing at the foot of the
Stairs to the upper floors. From the entrance vestibule a dog-leg
passage, lit from the street by two windows, runs west and
comes to a dead end. Perhaps it originally gave access toa room
on the north, but there is now no trace of a doorway. The area
to the north is inaccessible.

MEZZANINE (plan, fig. 61.4)

On the north side of the vestibule three steps lead up through
a door into the landing at the foot of the staircase to the upper
floors. In the east wall of that landing is the door from room ‘B’.
From the opposite (west) side six steps lead west up toasecond
landing where a doorway opens north into a corridor running
West to a pointed-arched window in the west wall of the
building. This corridor ives access to the two (originally
three) easternmost rooms (C-E) of the southern rubit‘ of Siq
al-Qattanin (see above, p. 280). Both the Passage and the rooms
must have been incorporated into the ribat at the time of its
construction. Stairs have been built into the middle room (D)
to give access to a yard and adjoining room (plate 61.5) above
bays 26-30 of Sug al-Qattanin, which appear to be Ottoman
additions (see above, p. 279). The easternmost room of the
rubit’, larger than the others, is entered through a door at the
east end of the corridor. That room has a window in its south
wall opening on the landing at the foot of the Staircase, a door
in the same wall giving access to the later room in the upper
Part of room ‘A’, a window in its €ast wall opening under the

aoe portico, and three windows in its north wall opening on
the Suq.

61.6). On the east side of the courtyard a door opens into a
barrel-vaulted cell (K). On the north side of the courtyard are
three barrel-vaulted cells (M—O) built on the roof of the ruba‘
At the east end of the north side of the courtyard a door Opens
toa landing from which a door opens east into room ‘L’, and an
open stair rises north then east to the roof of the Haram portico,
The north-east corner of room ‘L’ is rounded off Owing to the
propinquity of the massive structure of Bab al-Qattanin.

The stair that leads up to the roof of the portico may well
originally have given access to buildings there which belonged
to the ribat. The tenth/sixteenth and eleventh/seventeenth
century documents cited above seem to imply that at the time
when they were written there were on the portico roof
buildings associated with the ribat. Creswell’s 1920 photograph
(plate 31.1) shows the facade of various structures in just that
location, which were subsequently demolished in 1927. The
design of one window in that facade has suggested that these
structures might have belonged to the ‘Uthmaniyya (see above,
p. 547), but the possibility that at least some of them belonged
to the ribat cannot be ruled out.

","The site is bounded to the north by the street, Tariq Bab al-
Hadid, to the east by that part of the Arghiiniyya that is a passage
giving access to the Khatiiniyya, to the north by the Khatiniyya
itself, and to the west by some vaulted structures whose history
is not known.

The building line established by the Arghiiniyya was
followed by the builders of the Muzhiriyya but with a small
southward deflection of 1%° in order to accommodate the
overall alignment of the street as dictated by earlier buildings
(nos. 7, 32 and 58).

The building has four main parts: (1) A ground floor
consisting of various chambers disposed around a courtyard
which opens south to a gibla iwan with a mibrab. At the north-
west corner of the courtyard a staircase gives access to (2) an
upper floor of several small chambers entered from a gallery
round three sides of the courtyard, including another staircase
which leads up to (3) a top floor on the east and south sides of
the courtyard, comprising two decoratively vaulted chambers,
a large room over the gibla iwan and two small rooms on the
roof of the Arghiiniyya. (4) Across the roof of the Arghiniyya,
on the roof of the Haram portico stood an anteroom and
assembly hall that were demolished in 1925' and are known

65,"Il HISTORY
","IDENTIFICATION

There is no extant inscription. Mujir al-Din states that the
Muzhiriyya Madrasa is situated in the Bab al-Hadid Street and
adds, ‘part of it is built over the Arghiiniyya [see p. opel There
is an assembly hall (majma) above the Haram portico.

DATE ;
Mujir al-Din is once more our only source: ‘The construction of
the madrasa was completed in the year 885 [1480-81].

FOUNDER ;

The foundation of this institution was the work of the one-time
head of the Chancery Bureau (diwédn al-insha’) in Cairo, Zayn
al-Din Abii Bakr b. Muzhir al-Ansari al-Shafi‘i.> During his
career he held various offices, including the Inspectorate of the
Army. He was born into a family which had long served the
Mamluk régime in important administrative positions.
Althoushinomositive connechonicam bel traceditsseemsilikcely:
 that the two brothers, Fakhr al-Din Ahmad (d. 703/1303) and
Sharaf al-Din Ya‘qib (d. 714/1314), sons of Muzaffar b. Muzhir,
who both held high administrative posts in Damascus, were
ancestors of our Zayn al-Din Abi Bakr. Both were called ‘al-
Nabulusi’, for the family seems to have originated from
Nablus.° A Haram document dated 784/1382 contains the
testament of a man described as ‘one of the Muzhir clan of
Nablus’.’

Abt Bakr’s grandfather, Badr al-Din Muhammad b.
Ahmad, was twice head of Chancery (Ratib al-sirr) in Damascus.
He died in Jerusalem in Dhi’l-Qa‘da 793/October 1390.8
Another Haram document,’ dated that very same month,
authorized the sale of five slaves and a mule on behalf of his
orphan children. One of these children was another Badr al-
Din Muhammad,” the father-to-be of Abi Bakr. He had been
born in Damascus in 786/1384-85, and followed in the career
footsteps of his father, but moved to Cairo and became head of
the Chancery there as a result of his association with the Sultan
al-Mu’ayyad Shaykh, established when the latter was still
governor in Damascus.

It was in Cairo that Abt Bakr was born, in Rajab 831/April-
May 1428.'! He was orphaned at a young age when his father
died on Saturday, 26 Jumada II 832/2 April 1429.'? His father
was immediately succeeded as head of the Chancery by another
son, yet another Muhammad, known as Jalal al-Din, but in
office, as Badr al-Din like his father and grandfather. For this
appointment he paid 90,000 or 100,000 dinars from his father’s
estate, but was soon replaced and made secretary to the sultan’s
son.” Still not yet twenty, he died in Rajab 833/April 1430.4

Abt Bakr studied all the main Shafi'l law texts with the
leading Shafit scholars, and gained his professional
administrative skills through association with the top officials of
the day, including his guardian, Zayn al-Din ‘Abd al-Basit (see p.
519). His own career proceeded at a measured pace. He
eventually became head of the Chancery in 866/1462” and held
the post until his death. He came to Nablus in early 893/spring
1488 to raise troops for an expedition against the Ottomans,
and had hoped to visit Jerusalem but fell ill, and returned to
Cairo,!° where he died on Thursday, 6 Ramadan 893/14 August
1488."" The next day he was buried in the mausoleum he had
built in the Qarafa cemetery.

He had visited Jerusalem and Hebron ‘time after time’, and
had performed the pilgrimage to Mecca ‘more than once’. Two
public fountains (sabilayn) had been erected by him in Mecca
and a ribat and a madrasa in Medina. At Cairo he was the
 founder of a fine madrasa ‘near his house’ in the Birjawan
district, which was completed probably in 884/1479-80, that is,
about the same time as the building of his madrasa in
Jerusalem.'* The Cairo madrasa was established, as al-Sakhawi
tells us, to hold a SGfi community and to provide courses of
study in Koranic exegesis, the Tradition of the Prophet, and
jurisprudence and other unspecified matters. May one assume
the same for the Jerusalem foundation? Al-Sakhawi wrote,
‘Likewise he erected a small madrasa (madrasa latifa) in
Jerusalem’.

After his death he too was succeeded in the office of head
of the Chancery by a son, a fourth Badr al-Din Muhammad.!?
Some years later another son, Kamal al-Din Muhammad, took
over that position but only for a few months.’ In 910/1504 Badr
al-Din was arrested and died after dreadful torture 2! A further
son committed suicide rather than face what he feared from the
sultan, and then, to complete the deaths of three sons of Aba
Bakr within the space of one year, Kamal al-Din died of plague
in Ramadan 910/February 1505.22
 ENDOWMENT

A brief note in the Ottoman defter no. 602 attributes to the waqf
of the Muzhiriyya in Jerusalem one half of the village of Bayt
Sahir al-Wadi, valued there at 1,250 aspers, and also the Khan
of the Bani Sa‘d and its lands. No rental value for this is given.
However, sijill entries mention other resources. In the
appointment ofa rent-collector for an obscurely written village,
dependent on Jerusalem (read Jaw.t ?), the village wae
described as waqf for the Muzhiriyya Madrasa. A fruit
plantation, sold in 986/1578, was situated in the al-Sarara land,
Outside Jerusalem near the Damascus Gate, ‘waqf for the
Hospital of Saladin and the Muzhiriyya Madrasa’. A later entry
specifies that the share of the madrasa was one third.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

No later references to the functioning of this institution have
been found. That appointments, at least nominal ones,
continued to be endorsed by the court is shown by the sijill
references gathered by Asali. In 1022/1613 a Shaykh ‘Inayat
 Allah al-Ghazzi was appointed to half the headship
(mashyakha) and the post of mudarris.”’ Other eighteenth-
century entries suggest that the Muzhiriyya became at that time
the preserve of the al-Dajani family.”

In a report dated 14 November 1923 in the Palestine
Archaeological (Rockefeller) Museum (File 100 ‘Jerusalem’)
LA. Mayer states that the entrance to the [anteroom to the]
assembly hall had been recently blocked up. It had been open
when he first visited some eighteen months earlier.

According to Asali, the building became known as the
Sha‘bani House, because that family resided there until 1933,
when the Awqaf Administration bought it. It now continues to
provide residential accommodation, but is partly ruined.”
 "
65,"ARCHITECTURE
","STREET FACADE (figs. 62.6 and 62.7; plate 62.1)

The facade is arranged asymmetrically about a tall portal recess.
To the right of the recess are a small pointed slit window and a
higher rectangular window lighting ground floor rooms; at
upper floor level a recessed panel of ablag masonry contains a
double window with pointed horseshoe arches separated by a
marble shaft. At the right-hand (west) end of the facade a
chamfer with a mzqarnas head protects the north-west corner
of the building from abrasion.

To the left of the portal a pair of identical iron-grilled
windows are individually recessed under four tiers of finely
modelled muqarnas (plate 62.2). Within each recess the
window jambs are of red and cream-coloured ablaq
 supporting a lintel of greyish marble. A relieving arch above
each lintel has alternate voussoirs of an unusual yellow stone
lightly incised with arabesque tracery. Similar tracery
embellishes the next-but-one course above and also the
rectilinear mugarnas corbelling in a manner similar to that of
the Zamani Ribat (no. 61). The design of the tracery and of the
mugarnas corbelling is slightly different in each recess.
Directly above the recesses is a double horseshoe arched
window, identical to the one to the right of the portal, with a
small rectangular window to its left.

The lofty entrance portal, dominating the facade, is built of
red, yellow, black and cream-coloured ablaq enclosed within a
quirked ogee frame moulding (plate 62.1). The shallow
(0.80m) recess is spanned by eight tiers of fussy muqarnas
corbelling and a trefoil horseshoe arch. The door in the rear of
the recess is flanked by the usual stone benches. Its lintel is
surmounted by a string course of black and yellow ablaq
joggling. Above the string course a course of red stone
separates it from a recessed panel which extends around the
recess and onto the facade where it terminates ornamentally
within the limits of the frame moulding (see plate 62.2). High
in the rear wall of the recess a small squarish window lights one
of the upper floor rooms. It has a limestone frame 0.20m wide
incised with tracery similar to that of the paired ground floor
windows. The badly weathered mugarnas corbelling rises
from the level of this window’s sill up to the cusps where the
lateral lobes of the trefoil arch meet the top lobe. This top lobe
is filled by a very shallow conch, also carved with low-relief

tracerv
 GROUND FLOOR (plan, fig. 62.3)
The entrance doorway is arranged with internal recesses on
either side to allow double door leaves to lie flush with the
jambs. (The present door leaves are not original.) The door
leads into a cross-vaulted vestibule with openings in all sides: to
the east a grilled window (now blocked) into a double cross-
vaulted chamber (marked ‘H"" on the plan) lit by the paired
windows in the facade; to the west into a short passage leading
to a barrel-vaulted room (A!); and to the south an archway
Springing from mugarnas corbels opens for the full width of
the vestibule into the courtyard. pert
The disposition of Openings around the courtyard is quite
symmetrical save for a gadroon-arched well recess at the north
end of the west wall (plate 62.3), which gives access to a cistern
under the building. Two pointed-arched doors in each of the
east and west walls open into barrel-vaulted cells (B', C!, F!and
G’) ventilated by slits (of which only the two southern ones
remain open — see fig. 62.7) under the crowns of the vaults.
The tall barrel-vaulted swan occupies almost the whole of
the south side of the courtyard. Its pointed frontal arch springs
from mugarnas corbels (plate 62.4) and its red and cream-
coloured voussoirs are framed by a cyma reversa moulding
with a circular loop at the crown. Alternate voussoirs (the
cream-coloured ones) are each made up of two stones (see
plate 62.5). :
Deep excisions in the iwan’s barrel vault provide
clearance for doors in the middle of each side wall. The one in
the west wall has been blocked up, rendering the room beyond
 inaccessible, while that in the east wall is now surmounted by
a window not shown in Harvey's drawing of 1909 (fig. 62.9).

The south, gibla wall contains a decorated mibrab flanked
by shallow (0.21m deep) rectangular cupboard-like recesses.
The alignment of this wall is not at right-angles to the main
north-south axis since it follows the line of the pre-existing
north wall of the contiguous Khatiniyya (no. 31). This wall is
about 3° off the normal Mecca-orientation of the neighbouring
qibla walls (of nos. 31 and 32) but this appears not to have
worried the builders of the Muzhiriyya.

The pointed-arched mibrab, semicircular in plan with a
nook shaft on either side, is set in a panel of red and cream-
coloured ablag, the upper part of which is framed by a
rectangular band of black stone enclosing the arch (plate 62.6).
The columns, probably re-used Crusader elements, are of
streaky white marble resting on Mamluk bases of red stone and
supporting vase-shaped capitals (now badly eroded) bearing
arabesque tracery in low relief. The stone course immediately
above the capitals is similarly decorated, as is the base course.
Between these two courses the mibrab is lined with five strips
of inlaid stone, two black on each side of a central red one, the
black ones having palmette finials and the red one a trilobed
finial. The conch is of black stone with four drop-shaped inserts
of yellowish stone.*°

 UPPER FLOOR (plan, fig. 62.4)

At the west end of the north wall of the courtyard three
semicircular steps lead into the enclosed staircase to the upper
floor (see plate 62.7). Access to the rooms at this level is
provided by a gallery round the west, north and east sides of the
courtyard. This gallery has been widened on all three sides, the
extension being supported by a segmental arch spanning the
north end of the courtyard (plate 62.7) and half arches
Spanning the east and west sides. The gallery is shown as it was
Originally without the extension in fig. 31.9.

All the rooms are roofed with barrel vaults except for two
on the north side (A? and K?) overlooking the street, which are
more elaborately vaulted (as shown on the plan, fig. 62.4, and
Section, fig. 62.8). These two rooms may have served some
more important function than the others. The one in the north-
west corner appears originally to have been entered by a door
(now blocked; marked ‘a’ on the plan) at the head of the stairs.
Now it is reached through a later opening from the adjoining
room (B*) which is in turn reached by a later door from the
room (C’) to its south, but which evidently was initially entered
through a door (b) opening off the gallery. Room‘C” appears
once to have opened to the east for its full width, like an ivan.
 The other rooms at this level retain their original form. That in
the south-west corner (E?) has a slit window in its west wall and
a deep cupboard-like recess in its north wall. It opens to the
east into a low barrel-vaulted windowless chamber (F*) which
sits above the vault of the gibla iwén. For some reason this
chamber does not occupy all the available space over the izvdn
but has instead a very sturdy north wall varying in thickness
from 1.50m at its west end to 1.85m at its east end, It is now
piled high with debris, but even if that were removed there
would not be sufficient height to stand up in this space (see
section, fig. 62.7). To the east of chamber ‘F”’ lie a further two
small barrel-vaulted rooms (G? and H?) in the south-east
corner, entered from a porch at the south end of the east
gallery. Though these rooms along the south side stand higher
than the single storey cells of the adjoining Khatiiniyya none
has a window in its south wall; indeed three (F?, G? and H2) of
the four have no windows at all. Two rooms (I? and J*) on the
east side are likewise devoid of windows.
 TOP FLOOR (plan, fig. 62.5)

A door at the north end of the east gallery opens into the
staircase to the top floor. The stair leads into two small
chambers, ‘A® and ‘B®, over rooms ‘I”’ and J” of the upper
floor. The elaborate vaulting of these chambers caught Harvey's
fancy: ‘curiously ornamented domes and quaintly arranged
examples of fan vaulting . . . delight the architect by their
excellent combination of structural truth and appropriate
 decoration’. His drawing of the second vault (B*) is fig. 62.10.

From ‘B*’ a door opens east into a double cross-vaulted
porch (D>) leading out to the roof of the Arghtniyya and from
there to the former assembly hall above the Haram portico (see
below). Access to or from the staircase could have been
controlled from a barrel-vaulted room (E°) ey to the
south of the porch. A second door opens south from ‘B”’ into a
large hall, ‘C? (now partly divided by a modern partition),
roofed with two cross vaults and a folded cross vault. The
elaborate vaulting of the two chambers at the top of the stairs is
some indication of the importance of these two halls, ‘C? and
the assembly hall. The west part of ‘C?’, with the folded cross
vault, sits above the gibla iwan and has three windows
overlooking the courtyard. Here again there are no windows in
the south wall, presumably in order not to intrude on the
privacy of the courtyard of the Khatiiniyya below.

ASSEMBLY HALL

Detached from the rest of the building, the assembly hall lay to
the east beyond the roof of the Arghuniyya, ‘over the Haram
portico’ as Mujir al-Din wrote. Nothing now survives of it
except for a series of vaulting profiles observed in the east face
of the upper part of the Haram wall. It was, however, still
standing in 1909 when Harvey visited, and it is on the basis of
his drawings (our figs. 62.11 and 62.12) and his description that
it can be reconstructed with reference to early photographs
(such as plate 35.5).

Abutting against the north wall of the assembly hall of the
Jawhariyya (no. 58) stood an anteroom (fig. 62.12) leading
 south into the assembly hall (fig. 62.11). Access to the anteroom
from the roof of the Arghiniyya was by way of a door in the
upper part of the Haram wall. The room was roofed with a
 folded cross vault rising to an octagonal cupola decorated in
plaster with two tiers of muqarnas under a fluted domelet. A
double window with horseshoe arches separated by a central
column (similar to those in the street facade) overlooked the
Haram.

‘Evidently the assembly hall was vaulted in three bays:
intersecting barrel vaults to south and north of a central folded
cross vault rising to an octagonal cupola decorated with
chevron ribs spreading outward and upward from eight small
mugqarnas niches. Harvey’s drawing, fig. 62.11, shows only the
central and southern bays but we may assume the third,
northern, one since profiles of three vaults, in addition to that
of the anteroom, are discernible in the east face of the Haram
wall; and virtually all assembly halls in Mamlik Jerusalem have
tripartite vaults. Each bay overlooked the Haram through
paired pointed-arched grilled windows, and each had paired
recesses (now blocked up) in the east wall (visible in the
surviving masonry though not shown in Harvey’s drawing).
These recesses: must have been cupboards, not windows, for
there is no trace of openings in the west face of the wall.

A mibrab in the south, gibla wall of the assembly hall
(photographed by Creswell in 1920, plate 62.9) was flanked by
small recesses on either hand (fig. 62.11).

To the south of the assembly hall were further structures
on the roof of the Haram portico (see plate 35.5), demolished
at the same time as the assembly hall, which probably belonged
to the ‘Uthmaniyya (no. 57).

","At the west border of the Haram between the Bab al-Silsila
Minaret (no. 20) to the south and the ‘Uthmaniyya (no. 57) to

west portico of the Haram.
 "
66,"IL SITE AND BUILDINGS (figs. 63.2—63.4)
","The present building is the third Ashrafiyya to have been built
on the site within a space of twenty years (see below). Of the
two earlier constructions nothing appears to have survived
since each was demolished to make way for its successor. Only
two royal cartouches in the name of Sultan Khushqadam, for
whom the first madrasa was intended, may be remnants of the
initial construction. One of these cartouches is in secondary
use alongside some re-used muqarnas fragments (that look as
if they probably belonged originally to the present Ashrafiyya)
in a window recess above the Haram portico at Bab al-Silsila
(plate 63.1). The other is on display in the Mayer Memorial
Institute in Jerusalem.'
 The present building is on two floors, ground and upper,
of which the upper is the more extensive and important. The
boundaries of each floor do not coincide. The lower floor
protrudes east from the Haram wall beyond the line of the
Portico. It extends north from the base of the Bab al-Silsila
Minaret as far as that bay of the portico which supports the
south wall of the ‘Uthmianiyya. A copy of the endowment deed
(wadfiyya) is preserved in Cairo,” and that document gives the
following definition of the upper floor boundaries: to the south
 the interior of the Haram, the house belonging to the heirs of
the Shaykh Shihab al-Din al-‘Umayri [ie. the house over the
Haram gate] and the roof of the Baladiyya and the ribat [of
Tankiz (see above, p. 240) ] known as the Women’s Ribat; to the
east the interior of the Haram; to the north the Haram interior
again and the ‘Uthm§aniyya; and to the west the Baladiyya.*

Although very badly damaged by earthquakes, enough
survives of the building to allow us, with the aid of the waqfiyya
and Mujir al-Din’s description, to establish its original form.
Mujir al-Din gives the following outline:

The lower [ground] floor includes an assembly hall
(majma), adjoining the east side of the Haram portico,
and corresponding to three bays of this portico. This hall
has two doors: the first, to the north, is next to a window
opening under that part of the portico which supports the
‘Uthmaniyya Madrasa; the second, to the east, is flanked by
two windows, one on the left and the other on the right of
it. In the rear [i.e. south] wall of the majma‘ there is a
mibrab in the western part [of that wall] and a window
opening to the south in the eastern part. Next to this stands
a well-built porch to the south, beyond which, to the west,
is the door leading to the madrasa on the upper floor. This
door gives access to a vestibule paved with marble. In this
vestibule a door on the right opens into a small room, and
against the back (west) wall is a stone bench covered with
marble. To the left is a door leading to a spacious staircase
that rises to the madrasa on the upper floor and to the Bab
al-Salam Minaret [= Bab al-Silsila Minaret].

The staircase leads up to a door that opens into an outer
court (saha samawiyya) open to the sky and paved with
white flagstones. At the north end of this outer court a
rectangular door opens into a small vestibule from which
a passage leads to the madrasa over the assembly hall
described above.

This madrasa comprises four axial zzvdas: the south one
is the biggest, with a mibrab in its back (south) wall. Beside
the mibrab, to the east are two windows opening on the
Haram and, to the west, two windows opening on the
Haram towards the terrace of the [Dome of the] Rock.
Opposite them (in the west wall of the zwam) are three
windows opening on the outer court. In the north zwan
are two windows opening north and two opening east on
the Haram. The east zwvéin, which is the loggia (tarima), has
three arches on two marble columns. The upper part of it
has windows of Frankish glass (zujaj al-ifranji) of the
 utmost splendour and perfection. Facing it is the west
iwan, which has a window on the outer court of the
madrasa. The floor (of the madrasa) is entirely paved with
polychrome marble, and the walls are panelled in marble.
The ceiling is of wood covered with gold leaf and azure; it
is extremely well built and beautiful and very high.

Next to the north ivan is a vaulted room entered from
the small vestibule mentioned above (at the north end of
the outer court), whose door is on the left as you enter. Its
floor is paved with polychrome marble, and its walls
panelled in marble. It has two windows Opening on the
north zwan of the madrasa. Above this room is a small
chamber with a window Opening on the interior of the
madrasa and another on the outer court.

From the outer court a door leads to another court or
terrace where there are vaulted cells, the ablution place
 and the facilities (i.e. latrines), all of which are on top of
the south and east zvans and other parts of the Baladiyya
Madrasa.

The madrasa has carpets and lamps of unsurpassed
beauty, the like of which is not found elsewhere. Its roof is
clad with lead like those of [other buildings in] the Haram.

","IDENTIFICATION

The Ashrafiyya is identified by the extant inscriptions (see
below) and many descriptions and fixings of its position, not
least in the copy of the wadfiyya.

FOUNDER

La f | PSP PS Eee eme a NEE EME pr Pe MNRAS utc? a5 > Ws rete
 period. Its founder was the Sultan al-Malik al-Ashraf Sayf al-Din
Aba Nasr Qéaytbay al-Mahmidi al-Zahiri’ It is quite
unnecessary to give anything but a short notice of his life and
long reign (a little over twenty-nine years). A rough calculation
from the date of his death and the age he had then attained
(about eighty-four) suggests that he was born around about
817/1414-15. He was Circassian by origin and was imported
into Egypt by a merchant called al-Khawaja Mahmtd (hence the
‘al-Mahmiidi’ in his full name) in 839/1435-36, which means
that he was then more than twenty years of age. The Sultan al-
Ashraf Barsbay purchased him and he entered the barracks of
the royal mamliiks to begin his career. He was later bought
from the Treasury by the Sultan al-Zahir Jaqmaq, who
eventually gave him his freedom. That accounts for the ‘al-
Zahiri’ in his name. It was not until 862/1457-58, when he was
already in his forties, that the Sultan Inal made him an amir of
10. Thereafter his rise, under Khushqadam, was swift, and after
a period of confusion following the death of Khushqadam
Qaytbay was elevated to the sultanate — unwillingly, we are told.

He came to the throne in Rajab 872/January 1468. He was
much exercised by problems of foreign policy, with constant
trouble from the Aqqoyunlu and the Dhulghdadirids and the
growing threat from the Ottomans. As his long reign continued
so his authority in his own realms increased. He was a firm
ruler and noted for his scholarly and religious interests, and for
his ascetic life. He built extensively in Cairo and in the holy
cities of the Hijaz and elsewhere. His death took place on
Sunday, 27 Dhu’l-Qa‘da 901/7 August 1496.

DATE
The story of the building on the site near the Chain Gate is a
complicated one. In the first place a madrasa was begun in the
name of the Sultan Khushqadam by the Amir Hasan b. Tatar al-
Zahiri.° Hasan came to Jerusalem to act as Superintendent of
the Two Harams in Jumada II 869/February 1465,’ so the
building was presumably begun after that date. Khushqadam
died in Rabi‘ I 872/October 1467 and there followed two short
reigns of altogether just over one hundred days. Then, at the
beginning of Qéaytbay’s sultanate, Hasan al-Zahiri was
dismissed and went to Cairo to persuade Qaytbay to take over
the madrasa (or such of it as had been completed at that time).
This the sultan agreed to do and ‘inscribed his [own] name over
the door’ ®

This may refer to the inscription now found under the
noc of the Bab al-Sakina about six metres above ground-
evel:

The construction of this noble madrasa was ordered by
our Lord the Sultan al-Malik al-Ashraf Abi: Nasr Qaytbay
(may his triumph be mighty) on the first day of the month
of Rabi‘ I in the year eight hundred and seventy-five [28
August 1470] during the time of our lord, his most noble
excellency, Nasir al-Din Sidi Muhammad the Treasurer,
Superintendent of the Two Noble Harams (may God
magnify his position).

One might imagine that this inscription records the date of
the completion of the madrasa in its initial guise. However, the
superintendent named (he was Nasir al-Din Muhammad al-
Nashashibi) took up his appointment in his own right
(istiglalan) in Muharram 875/July 1470,""° that is, only a month
before. He had, it is true, been present in Jerusalem since the
Previous year to correct the disorders and administrative
irregularities which were the legacy of his predecessor,
Bardibak al-Taji.'' Yet the above inscription was, as van
Berchem has shown, completed in two separate stages. The
date and the name of the superintendent were added later than
the rest in a separate roundel.!? According to Mujir al-Din, it
was Bardibak al-Taji who in the year 873/1468-69 ‘saw to the
completion of the madrasa, provided doors for itand furnished
it with carpets.’

In Rajab 880/November 1475 Qaytbay paid a visit to
Jerusalem, where he found the madrasa he had accepted as his
 Own not to his liking.” A few years later, in 884/1479-80, he sent
an officer from his court (khdssaki) to see to the demolition and
extension of the building. The digging of the new foundations
began on the 14 Sha‘ban 885/19 October 1480.” In the
following year the sultan sent a team of craftsmen from Cairo to
work on the new madrasa. Further changes in the design were
then made by the Christian architect who accompanied them. '®

Van Berchem has argued that these changes concerned
the advancing of the building line of the majma‘ (assembly
hall) beyond that of the Haram portico to make it jut out into the
Haram.”’ It seems that he has forced a meaning upon the text of
Mujir al-Din which is not the obvious one. After the destruction
of the old madrasa ‘which was on the portico of the Haram, the
builders embarked on the new construction and built the
lower assembly hall, adjoining (mudsiq) the Haram portico to
the east’.’* One would naturally understand from this that the
building was outside the building line of the portico. If it is
argued that in this passage Mujir al-Din is looking beyond the
modifications made by the Christian architect and considering
the final stage of the building as it is today, one could ask why
then does Mujir al-Din use very similar language in his
description (which is later in terms of the progress of his
chronicle) of what is manifestly the building before the
architect wished to change it: ‘when he saw the lower assembly
hall built in the Haram next to (bi-/asq) the portico, he did not
like itand wished to demolish it completely’.’’ To claim that the
text here refers to a building within the alignment of the
portico is very difficult. In fact, the architect was unable to do as
he wished, for reasons that are not specified, and he contented
himself with demolishing part of the assembly hall on the south
side and also three arches of the Haram portico ‘near the door
leading to the minaret’. Purely on the basis of these passages,
the Christian architect’s demolition could have been directed
towards the building of the grand portal of the madrasa. That
was his contribution, while the advancement of the majma‘
beyond the portico had been planned from 885/1480. After all,
Qaytbay had taken against the madrasa presumably because it
was too small and had ordered its enlargement in 884/1479-80.

The main construction work of the new madrasa was
completed after a couple of years and the date was recorded on
an inscription band on either side of the entrance within the
new imposing portal:

The construction of this blessed madrasa was ordered by
the exalted imam and the revered prince, the Sultan al-
Malik al-Ashraf Abi Nasr (may his triumph be mighty). It
was completed in the month of Rajab the Unique in the
year eight hundred and eighty-seven [August-September
1482].

ENDOWMENT

Before the major rebuilding the sultan appointed sixty Sifis, an
unspecified number of law students and other service
personnel. These were supported by the assignment of waqfs
in Gaza to the madrasa.”! The date of this early waqf was 877/
1472 according to the later Ottoman defters, or more accurately
as 5 Rabi‘ I 877/9 September 1472 by a Jerusalem sijill
reference.” However, the extant wagfiyya copy in Cairo is
dated 21 Shawwal 881/6 February 1477, an endowment with the
rebuilding in mind, no doubt. A further endowment made by
Qaytbay, necessitated by extra expenditure, is dated 895/1489-
90. The properties which formed the endowment for the
Ashrafiyya were very numerous indeed. They have been listed
elsewhere” and there is little point in repeating all the names
here. Of the agricultural properties, consisting of widely
varying portions of village lands and mazraas, thirty-four
belonged to the district of Gaza, three to Hebron, two each to
Jerusalem and Ramla and one each to Nablus and the Hawran,
making forty-three in all. The urban properties were all in Gaza
and were made up of the caravanserai and eight shops in the
Turcomans’ Market, six g@ as in that same quarter, along with a
bath-house near the madrasa, a bakery, mill and two orchards,
 and outside the city in the Sheep Market, various shops, a gaa,
and a press (mi sara).

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY
(i) Mamltk period y
While Khushqadam was still living, Shihab al-Din al-‘Umayri al-
Shafi had been appointed as the first shaykh of the initial
madrasa.™* After its completion by Bardibak in 873/1468-69 he
gave his inaugural lecture in the assembly room before the
Qadis and the ulema on the Koranic text, ‘He only shall cause
God's mosques to prosper who believes in God and the Last
Day, etc.” He was confirmed by Qaytbay in 876/1471.”° It is said
that in 886/1481 Burhan al-Din al-Karaki was replaced as
shaykh by Salih al-Din al-Tarabulusi,”” and yet, when in 890/
1485 Kamal al-Din b. Abi Sharif was given the headship of the
new madrasa, it was ‘by virtue of the death of al-‘Umayri’.® With
the arrival of Ibn Abi Sharif and his installation in the presence
of many dignitaries, the new madrasa became fully operational.
Just two years before, when Felix Fabri visited Jerusalem, he
had been able to visit the madrasa, which was still in the process
of having its internal decoration and furnishing completed.”

As the Tankiziyya was used as the seat of the judiciary, so
the buildings of the Ashrafiyya were used for public inquiries.
For example, in 895/1490 the conduct in office of the governor
of Jerusalem, Dugqmagq, was scrutinised by a_ royal
commissioner in the lower assembly hall.3° In 898/1492 an
inquiry was held there into the operation of the madrasas of
Jerusalem and their supporting waqfs.*"" In fact, Mujir al-Din
records that just a little earlier, in 890/1485, after the
completion of the new building, the lower majma‘ was
assigned to the imam of the Hanbalis to lead prayers there.
Formerly, the Hanbali imam had used for that purpose the
portico of the Haram, just below the Bab al-Silsila Minaret 22
This is confirmed by al-‘Umari.? As late as 1001/1592 this use by
the Hanbalis continued. Muhammad b. Ahmad al-Qudsi al-
Khurrayshi, having studied in the Azhar, returned to Jerusalem
where ‘he was imam of the Hanbalis in the assembly hall
(majma ), which is below the madrasa of Qaytbay’ *4

In 902/1496 the Ashrafiyya, along with other buildings in
Jerusalem, suffered from an earthquake.» The damage at that
time must have been slight because subsequent Muslim visitors
write of the madrasa as though it was still flourishing. Al-
Nabulusi gave a detailed independent description of the
madrasa with no hint of any destruction or dilapidation,>° and
 in 1080/1669-70 Evliya Celebi visited the building and climbed
the adjoining minaret to enjoy the panoramic view over the city
and the Haram.’ As for Christian pilgrims, Pietro Casola after a
visit in 1494 remarked on a marvellous mosque built ten years
before, which appears to be the Ashrafiyya. In that connection
he added that ‘it appears to me that the Moors do not lack good
master workmen for their buildings’ ** Arnold von Harff, who
saw the building in 1498, wrote later of ‘a beautiful little
mosque’, built by ‘the old Sultan Kathubee, who died five years
ago’, adding mistakenly that he is ‘honourably buried there’ 2?
(i) Ottoman period
The appointments to offices within the madrasa which are
recorded in the sijills show that, as was the case generally, they
tended to be transferred within families.“° It is odd to find that
the top posts of shaykh and administrator passed into the hands
of the al-Dayri family, who were Hanafis, and to members of the
Ibn Jama‘a family, who had changed their allegiance from the
Shafi'l school to the Hanafi, although the madrasa had been
founded as a Shafi‘ institution.“’ Furthermore, an attempt to
abolish the separate post of mutawwalli and combine it with that
of na@zir was unsuccessful. In 964/1557 a judgement to that
effect was made by the Qadi of Jerusalem,” based ona reading
of the wagfiyya — and strangely enough the wadfiyya dated 877/
1472, not the later ones — a royal decree -appointing the then
holder of the administratorship after the death of the
mutawalliya, Misti Khunad, a descendant of the royal founder,
in that same year, and finally a fatwa from the Mufti of Istanbul.
It should also be noted that some of the sijill entries refer to ‘the
waqf of the two madrasas’, those founded by Qaytbay at
Jerusalem and Gaza, as though the administration had been
amalgamated after the destruction of the madrasa at Gaza.
That was the case with an account presented by ‘the
mutawalli of the waqf of the two madrasas . .. inJerusalem and
Gaza’ in the year 962/1555.* All the expenditure was for the
personnel of the Jerusalem foundation, which included thirty
individuals described as ‘Siifis, readers of Koran parts’ and
eight law students (talaba). This last category is rare for any of
the Jerusalem institutions of learning in the sijills that have
been examined and certainly suggests a continued functioning.
The wagf lands were leased or farmed out. In 964/1556-57
Musa b. al-Shaykh ‘Ali al-Khalwati was given the farm of the
rents from two shares (i.e. 2 girdits, each being a twenty-fourth)
of Bayt Dajan, two and a third shares of Qatra, and five-eighths
ofa share of al-Safiriyya (?), all described as ‘the waaf of the two
 madrasas’.“! Four years later the ndzir leases to the mudarris,
or at least the mzudarris named for the year 966, these same
lands and several others for a sum, 88 gold pieces, which is then
assigned to him as his salary for that same year, and he was
made agent for the collection of the rents outstanding.* In later
years, rent arrears for two years from two villages, Ibya (?) and
Majid, were recovered from a Nur Allah Jawish, whose father,
Hasan Jawish, could only produce proof of having paid one
year’s rent of a three year lease.*°

The practice of convening inquiries in the Ashrafiyya
continued. In 967/1560 a majlis was held there before the
governor of Jerusalem to look into the Jewish community’s
leasing of the Salahiyya Madrasa’s waqf lands in Gethsemane as
a cemetery.”
 "
66,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","GROUND FLOOR (fig. 63.3)

(i) Assembly hall

The assembly hall incorporates three bays of the west portico of
the Haram, built in 737/1336-37, which form the western part of
the hall. The eastern part is vaulted in three bays built against
these three bays of the portico (see section, fig. 63.8). Four
piers of the portico support the vaults; two of the piers remain
free standing in the middle of the hall and two are built into the
north and south walls (see plan, fig. 63.3). Part of the north wall,
where it abuts against the pier, is carried on a half-arch (plate
63.2), apparently designed to discharge the weight of the wall
onto new foundations rather than onto the foundation of the
pier. This sensible precaution minimized the turning moment
on the pier and so reduced the risk of collapse.** To west and
east of that pier are respectively a grilled window and a door in
the north wall of the hall. Both are built of red and cream-
coloured ablaq masonry enclosed within a quirked ogee frame
moulding. Above the window is a smaller rectangular window,
and above the door is a pointed-arched window.

In the middle of the east wall of the hall is a door with a
rectangular window on either side of it (fig. 63.5, plate 63.3), all
constructed in ablaq enclosed by frame mouldings like those
in the north wall. Each is surmounted by a pointed-arched
window. The three openings in this east wall were restored
recently when the Aqsa Mosque Library was established in the
hall.

A more elaborately decorated window surmounted bv a
 circular oculus opens in the eastern part of the south wall (see
below). A pointed-arched mibrab of red and cream-coloured
ablag occupies the western part of the wall. It has recesses on
either side to take nook-shafts but these are no longer in place.
A small rectangular window above the mihrab is now blocked
up. Between the window and the mibrab a pier of the earlier
portico projects into the hall (see plan, fig. 63.3; and section, fig.
63.8). Immediately to the right of the mihrab the wall is stepped
back in order not to block an earlier window, now a door,
which opens in the rear wall of the east zwdan of the Baladiyya
(above, p. 449), which is the Haram wall forming the west
boundary of the assembly hall. Another window of the
Baladiyya, that of room ‘A’ to the north, originally opened
under the Haram portico but now opens into this hall.

(ii) Entrance

The impressive entrance porch (plate 63.4 and fig. 63.7) stands
directly to the south of the assembly hall. Both the porch and
the hall were built together, as the continuity of the masonry
shows. Therefore, if the Coptic architect in charge of the final
construction of the Ashrafiyya, including the entrance porch,
retained anything of the earlier assembly hall on the site (see
above, p. 591) it must have been no more than its plan and
possibly its foundations.

The porch opens through two pointed arches to east and
south. Both arches are similarly constructed of red and cream-
coloured ablagq vousssoirs enclosed by a quirked ogee
moulding with little loops above the keystones. Iron tie bars are
used to connect the springings in order to counteract the
tendency of any residual outward thrust to overturn the
supporting pier at the south-east corner of the porch. An
engaged column carved with low relief arabesques and bearing
a royal inscription in the name of Qaytbay*’ above the base,
articulates the outer corner of that pier (see plate 63.3). (A
smaller engaged column adorns the north-east corner of the
assembly hall.)

The vaulting of the porch is a very elaborate form of folded
cross vault (plate 63.5) of a type that was popular in Cairo
during Qaytbay’s reign.” Alternate courses are painted red to
simulate ablaq. The south-east corner of the vault appears to
have been rebuilt at some time; it also is painted to simulate
ablaq though here the painting and the underlying stone
coursing do not coincide (see plate 63.5). A cruciform panel
carved in low relief with strapwork star patterns is set into the
crown of the vault with four smaller lozenges of arabesque
 inserted between the pointed arms of the cruciform panel and
the sides of the vault.

On the north side of the porch is a stone bench above
which is the grilled window in the south wall of the assembly
hall (see above) set in a shallow recess spanned by an angular
 mugqarnas hood. The window has ablag jambs and a lintel
composed of three interlocking stones and decorated with low
relief carving. Above the lintel is a joggled pseudo-relieving
— surmounted by the oculus composed of ablaq voussoirs,
a

So decorated with low relief carving. Each of these
 components is framed by a narrow band of red stone. The three
tiers of mugarnas corbelling spanning the recess are
decorated with low relief arabesques similar to those shown in
plate 63.6. On either side of that corbelling and in the
tympanum above, more arabesque carving surrounds three
circular royal cartouches of Qaytbay (fig. 63.10).

The entrance doorway is set in a trefoil-arched recess in
the west wall of the porch (plate 63.4). As if to compensate for
its secluded position, the builders seem to have employed
every technique of decoration available to them. It is
constructed of black, red and cream-coloured ablaq, each
course being bedded on a thin sheet of lead that, when new,
would have appeared on the surface as a thin black line. This
technique of using lead instead of mortar for aesthetic effect
appears to have developed in Cairo during the ninth/fifteenth
century.”! The lead and the ablagq extend only as far as a double
quirked ogee moulding (fig. 63.7) which frames the recess (see
plate 63.4 and fig. 63.5). This moulding extends to frame stone
benches flanking the door. At regular intervals little circular
loops (called ‘mims’ in Arabic since they resemble that letter in
Arabic script) punctuate the moulding. The joggled ablaq faces
of the benches are decorated with palmette inserts beside the
trefoil extensions of the frame moulding. Six courses above the
threshhold the inscription recording the completion of
construction” (see above, p. 591) extends around the recess,
interrupted by the door opening, and terminates at each end in
trefoil ablag finials just inside the frame moulding. The door
lintel is a single block of mottled grey granite, on either side of
which are small rectangular panels of arabesque carving. Above
the lintel is a pseudo-relieving arch composed of intricately
interlocking voussoirs of black and cream ablaq. This arch is
flanked by two panels of carved strapwork. A band of red stone
frames these panels and the pseudo-relieving arch. A
rectangular grilled window above the arch lights the vestibule
within. The intricate decoration of the portal culminates in the
vaulting of the recess. Enclosed by the trefoil arch are two
muqarnas corner squinches supporting a shallow semidome.
Alternate voussoirs of the trefoil arch are covered with
arabesque carving. The same carving is applied also to the
surface of the muqgarnas squinches (plate 63.6). The limestone
semidome is inlaid with a fantastic pattern of scrolls and
palmettes in red stone highlighted here and there with inserts
of a black substance (stone or bitumen) and of turquoise
faience. The original timber door leaves, of walnut inlaid with
pinewood according to the wagfiyya,’ bound by beautiful
 SULIT AY EY VA

inscribed brass bands (fig. 63.11), are now in the Islamic
Museum on the Haram.

The doors open in a splayed embrasure to the lofty
vestibule, which is roofed by a multi-faceted cross vault similar
to that of the porch except for an octagonal panel in place of a
cruciform one at the crown (fig. 63.12). It is built entirely of
limestone ashlars. A stone bench, originally faced with marble,
» occupies a pointed-arched recess that spans almost the full
width of the back (west) wall. The rear wall of this recess is the
Haram wall and in that wall are the remains of one of the
springers of that part of the portico that was demolished to
make way for the present building (see above, p. 591). To the
left (south) of the springer is a curious window with a high,
steeply sloping sill like a chute (now partly blocked, see plate
63.7). This appears to have been an abat-jour admitting light to
the vestibule from the outer court above.

On the north side of the vestibule a pointed-arched
doorway, the ablaq voussoirs of which are framed by a quirked
ogee moulding with a loop at the top and volutes under the
springers, opens into a small room (marked ‘M’ on the plan),
now used for storing coffins, lit by a grilled window in its east
wall beside the entrance portal.The vault of this room supports
a mezzanine chamber, identical in plan, reached by steps
through an opening in the west end of its floor, and lit by a
window in its south wall opening on the vestibule. The window
in its north wall, opening above the mibrab in the assembly
hall, is blocked (see above).

A pointed-arched doorway in the south wall of the
vestibule, decorated in the same way as the one in the north
wall, leads through a small cross-vaulted hall (N), lit by a
window in its east wall, to the main staircase to the upper floor.
The west end of the hall, at the foot of the stairs, is roofed by a
folded cross vault with an octagonal panel of carved strapwork
set into its crown (plate 63.8). On the west side of this hall is the
grilled window of the Baladiyya tomb chamber (see above, p.
449) opening in the Haram wall.

STAIRCASE

The staircase rises in eight flights round a rectangular core (see
fig. 63.3). All the flights except the top one are roofed by rising
barrel vaults. There are landings between the flights, the first
and third roofed by cross vaults, the seventh (top) by a barrel
vault, and all the others by folded cross vaults with octagonal
panels set into the crowns (fig. 63.13). At each eastern landing a
window opens on the Haram. These windows, pointed-arched

—s

ee ee
 on the inside and rectangular on the outside, are arranged in
pairs with externally matching sill and head heights so as to
conceal the fact that there is a stair within (see plate 63.9 and fig.
63.5). In the north wall of the fourth landing a door (now
blocked) opens into a mezzanine chamber above the hall 'N , lit
by a grilled window in its north wall opening on the vestibule.
The window grille is made of turned wood: In the south wall of
the staircase a vertical break in the stonework marks the
conjunction between the staircase and the earlier base of the
minaret (plate 63.10). From the top landing two windows (now
blocked) opened north into the south ivan of the madrasa (see
Jig. 63.4). A door opens south from the same landing into a
parallel flight of eight steps that lead up to the entrance to the
minaret. Just beyond that door a second door (now blocked)
led into a narrow room (0) lit by a window in its south wall.

UPPER FLOOR (fig. 63.4)

At the west end of the top landing a pointed-arched door leads
into the outer court. The west face of the door (plate 63.11) is
decorated like those in the side walls of the entrance vestibule
(see above).

() Upper terrace

Facing that door is a pointed-arched door, similarly decorated,
opening at the south end of the west parapet wall of the outer
court. This door opens directly to the upper terrace, situated
above the southern part of the Baladiyya. A Parapet wall on the
north side of the terrace shields the courtyard of the Baladiyya
below from view. On the south side of the terrace are six doors
leading into six vaulted cells (S-X). The first of these (S) was
probably lit originally by a window in its south wall,
overlooking the roof of Tankiz’s ribat (see above, p. 240), now
blocked by later buildings to the south. Cell ‘T’ was originally
similar to ‘S’. The window in its south wall is now a door. Its
entrance door was recently blocked and it is now reached from
the adjoining cell (U) by way ofa new door in the common wall.
The south wall of ‘U’ appears to have been dismantled at some
time and replaced by a much thinner wall containing no
window. Cells ‘V-X’ seem never to have had windows in their
south walls, the opening in the south wall of ‘Ww’ being a later
modification.

At its west end the terrace turns north over the west iwan
of the Baladiyya. In the corner where the south and west parts
of the terrace meet, a masonry salient contains the door of cell
‘X’ which is bigger than the others. The double window in its
west wall is a later insertion.

Of the five cells that were situated according to the
wagfiyya™ on the west side of the terrace, nothing remains. The
present structures there are modern. Nor does any trace exist
of the bab al-mutawadda’, the ‘door of the ablution place’,
which according to the wagfiyya was situated at the north end
of the terrace. It is unclear whether or not that door led into a
private ablution place reserved for the occupants of the
madrasa. It is conceivable that it led-to the mihlin chile...
 place immediately to the north (the Siqaya of al-‘Adil built in
589/1193 which, though much rebuilt, still serves its intended
purpose to this day).

(ii) Outer court

At the south end of the outer court are three doors (plate
63.11), two with pointed arches flanking a rectangular one. The
left-hand door opens into a passage (P) leading towards the
property over the Haram gate, which in 895/1490 when the
wadfiyya was drawn up belonged to the heirs of Shaykh Shihab
al-Din al-‘Umayri (see above, p. 589). This may be the door
referred to in the wagfiyya as the bdb sirr,® the ‘secret door’,
since it would have allowed direct access to the madrasa from
the house of al-‘Umayri, the first shaykh of the madrasa (see
above, p. 592).

The central rectangular door opens into a small room (Q)
lit by a window in its south wall. On the left (east) just inside the
door is a low opening, now fitted with a grilled door (plate
63.12), which leads into a narrow winding staircase down to the
entrance of the Baladiyya (see above, p. 447). This also may be
the secret door referred to in the wagfiyya (the text is not clear)
since it allowed access to and from the madrasa that was
independent of the main stairs up from the Haram.

A door (presumably a later insertion) in the west wall of
‘Q’ opens into the adjoining room (R), which is entered
through the third (western) door at the south end of the outer
court. A recess in the south wall may originally have contained
a window, now blocked by adjoining constructions to the
south. In addition the room is lit by a high-level window
(possibly a later insertion) which Opens north on the upper
terrace. The west wall has been removed to connect this room
with the adjoining cell (S).

The parapet wall on the west side of the court, like those
of the upper terrace, shields the Baladiyya courtyard from view.
It is remarkable how carefully the privacy of adjoining
buildings is preserved.

The upper part of the east wall of the outer court is
missing, though some idea of its original height (about 10.5m)
may be gained from Salzmann’s photograph taken in 1854
(plate 63.13) when part of the wall was still standing. Two
shallow recesses with sloping sills in the surviving lower part of
the wall contain four windows (now blocked), three in the
southern recess (plate 63.14) which opened on the south iwan
of the madrasa, and one in the northern recess which opened
on the west iwén. The decoration of these windows is similar
to that of the window in the north wall of the entrance porch on
the ground floor: ablaq jambs, lintels composed of three
 interlocking stones carved with low relief strapwork, and
joggled pseudo-relieving arches (plate 63.15). A sundial in the
wall between the two recesses was designed to display the time
with respect to the beginning of the afternoon prayer and also
the beginning and end of the interval during which it was
permitted to perform the prayer” (see fig. 43.5).

At the north end of the court stood an impressive portal, of
which only the lower part remains, now incorporated into a
 modern wall (plate 63.16). Its decoration, described in great
detail in the wagfiyya,® recalls that of the main entrance on the
ground floor: red, white and black ‘marble’, flanking stone
benches, panels of carving on either side of the lintel and
relieving arch, a panel of inscription gilded on an azure
background, a window (flanked by two small marble columns)
above the door, all set in a recess spanned by a mugqarnas hood
(see fig. 63.9). The door leaves were of walnut inlaid with
pinewood, bound with filigreed brass bands, with two heavy
rings of inlaid brass or bronze for handles.

This doorway gave access to a group of rooms, none of
which survives. Mujir al-Din’s description and the text of the
wadfiyya tell us that it opened into a vestibule from where a
 short passage (marked ‘Y on the plan, fig. 63.4) leads east into
the madrasa. Another door opened north into a vaulted room,
richly panelled in marble.” Two windows (the southern of
which is now blocked) in the east wall of this room opened on
the north zwdn of the madrasa. Opposite one of these windows
was a door into a latrine (mustarah) with a paved floor in which
was a basin (bawd) for water. From the latrine, steps led to an
upper chamber. On the right of its entrance were two windows,
one with a screen of turned wood overlooking the Baladiyya to
the west, and another opening on a small yard in which was a
door into a room over the vestibule. From this description it
would seem that the largely modern boundary wall of the
present structure to the north of the outer court must follow
more or less the line of the original boundary walls (see plan,
fig. 63.4, which includes dotted lines to show how the original
internal walls might have been arranged). Room ‘T’ of the
Baladiyya (above, p. 451), which has a curious shaft in its north
wall, is directly below where the Ashrafiyya latrine appears to
have been located.

(iii) Madrasa

The passage (Y) from the vestibule leads into the north-west
corner of the central court (called diirqda in the wagqfiyya) of
the madrasa. Only the lower 5.70m of the west wall (originally
about 10.5m high) and of the western parts of the north and
south walls of the madrasa survive. The eastern parts,
overlooking the Haram, have almost entirely disappeared. On
the basis of the surviving remains (plates 63.3 and 63.17) and
the text of the wagfiyya we can, however, establish its original
form and decoration. It had four axial iwdns disposed
symmetrically around the central court.

South iwan. The south iwén was the largest. The mibrab
in the middle of its south wall has recesses in each side for
nook-shafts but these no longer survive (plate 63.18).
Constructed of plain limestone, the mibrab was originally
decorated with some sort of veneer, as pick marks in the
spandrels indicate. The wagfiyya describes it as being lined
with black and white marble, porphyry and mottled granite.
To the right of the mibrab are the two windows (now blocked)
that opened on the top of the staircase (plate 63.19); to the left
were two more windows, overlooking the Haram to the south.
In the west wall of this zvdn are the three windows (now
blocked) which opened on the outer court, and opposite these,
in the east wall of the ivan, were another three windows
overlooking the Haram to the east. Above all these openings a
gilded Koranic inscription,°! the western part of which survives
(see plate 63.19), ran around the walls of the iwdan and
continued round all the interior walls of the madrasa. A lobed
roundel within the inscription above the mibrab may once
have contained a royal cartouche (see below), but it is too badly
eroded to tell.

North twain. The north iwdn was similar to the south zvdn
except for its depth (5.31m as opposed to 8.02m), which
allowed room for only two windows in its west and east walls.
Of five arched recesses in its north wall only the western three

 meEmMail UPLAte'OD.4U) lacie Crow he oa oe
iwan. The missing eastern pair were windows overlooking the
Haram to the north. The three blind western arches could not
contain windows since the earlier ‘Uthmaniyya lies
immediately beyond them; they were used instead as
cupboards for books that formed part of the madrasa’s
endowment.” (The central cupboard has a recent window into
the ‘Uthmaniyya in its rear wall.) The eastern cupboard,
opposite the mibrab, has recesses in each side, presumably for
nook-shafts matching those of the mibrab but these no longer
survive. The spandrels of the arches are decorated with
arabesque carving in low relief. Above ran the Koranic
inscription which includes above the eastern cupboard the
surviving lower half of a lobed roundel, like the one over the
mibrab, containing a royal cartouche in the name of Qaytbay.

Salzmann’s early photograph (plate 63.13) shows that the
exterior decoration of the two eastern windows was similar to
that of the windows on the east side of the outer court,
described above.

Traces of a springing above the west abutment of the
iwan’s frontal arch (visible in plate 63.20) show that the arch
rose from muqarnas imposts, was slightly horseshoed, and was
composed of red and cream-coloured ablaq voussoirs framed
by a double quirked ogee moulding with loops (‘mims’) at
regular intervals around the extrados. It would be safe to
assume that the frontal arch of the south zwén was similar.

West iwéin. The springers of the frontal arch of the west
iwan also survive, and these show that though this arch was
decorated like that of the north wdén it was highly stilted. The
reason for this difference can be deduced from the plan (fig.
63.4), for whereas the north and south iwvdns spanned almost
the full width of the central court, the west zwén is flanked by
the door of the entrance passage (Y) to the north and by
another doorway to the south which gave access to stairs
leading up to the roof. This meant that the west zwvdn was only
4,.26m wide compared with approximately 7.65m for the north
and south iwéims, and so for the west ivan to rise to the same
height as these others it had to be stilted. The window (now
blocked) in the west wall of the zwvén opened on the outer
court.

East twdan. Nothing whatsoever survives of the east 7wan,
hutiwe know fram the wading and Miaiir al-Din’s descrintion
 that this was the most significant one. Its frontage on the central
court of the madrasa must have been very similar if not
identical to that of the west zwdn, comprising a central stilted
arch flanked by two doorways. What made this zvédn different
was the treatment of its east wall. Here was a triple window
overlooking the Dome of the Rock. It had three arches
supported on two marble columns with gilded capitals and
bases resting on a low parapet wall (the lower part of which
survives — see plate 63.3). The tympanums of the arches were
filled with polychrome glass, presumably arranged in
decorative patterns set in plaster tracery, with circular shields
in the centre bearing religious invocations in green glass.” This
type of window is called gamariyya in Arabic and the wagfiyya
refers to the east zwdn as a maq ad qamari, Mujir al-Din uses
the term ‘drima, equivalent to ‘loggia’ in English. The
significant feature of this loggia was the uninterrupted view it
gave of the Haram and the Dome of the Rock.

The floors of the central court and the zwans were paved
with polychrome marble, and a marble dado covered the lower
part of the walls. The floor of the court was one step lower than
those of the zzvdns; the steps on the south and north sides were
of white ‘Gaza’ marble, and those on the west and east sides
were of ‘Aleppo’ marble.® The courtyard and the iwdns had a
timber roof with, in all probability, an octagonal lantern over
the centre of the courtyard. Such octagonal lanterns are a
typical feature of contemporary madrasas in Cairo. The carved
wooden ceiling was painted gold and azure. The roof itself was
covered with a lead cladding. The ceiling was very high. Al-
Nabulusi, who visited Jerusalem in 1101/1690 and again in
1105/1693, wrote a detailed account of the building in which he
claimed that it was as high as the adjoining minaret, but this is
clearly an exaggeration. Nevertheless, we know from the
wagfiyya that the madrasa’s windows were surmounted by
other windows, and by extrapolating an arch from the
curvature of the surviving springer of the north iwdn and
collating the result with Salzmann’s photographs, it can be
shown that the ceiling was not less than 10.5m above the floor.
Given this imposing height and the extraordinarily elaborate
decoration (plate 63.20) it is easy to understand why Mujir al-
Din was moved to describe the madrasa as the ‘third jewel’ of
the Haram, the other two being the Aqsa Mosque and the Dome
afthe Rack” (fios 63.6 and 63.9).

","On the Haram esplanade about 15m north-east of the

 "
67,"II SITE AND BUILDING (plate 64.1)'
","The sabil is situated at the north-west corner of a raised stone
prayer platform (musalld) with a free-standing mibrab on the
south side (plate 64.2). Directly underneath lies a vast cistern,
the source of the sabil’s water supply, said to have been an
ancient gate passage.”

The sabil, built entirely of stone, consists essentially of a
simple square room, with large grilled windows in the south,
west and north sides, and an internal well-recess and an
entrance door in the east side. Over this room a stilted dome is
raised on a tall zone of transition. The exterior of the dome is
decorated with arabesque carving in low relief: the only

significant sculptured arabesque dome that exists outside Cairo
(see above, p. 91).
 "
67,"Il HISTORY
","ee ee,

Little of the early history of the sabil is known. Mujir al-Din tells
us that

... among the buildings restored by Sultan Qaytbay when
he rebuilt his madrasa was the sabil facing it in the interior
of the Haram, above the well opposite the west stair of the
[Dome of the] Rock. Astone dome formerly stood over this
well, like the other wells? in the Haram. It was demolished
and the new sabil was built, the floor paved in marble, and
it had an elegant appearance.‘

Thus, according to Mujir al-Din, an earlier domed sabil once
stood on the site. The date of that earlier dome is not known
exactly, but around the present sabil an inscription,
commemorating restorations made in 1300/1883 by the
Ottoman Sultan ‘Abd al-Hamid, includes the information that
the original structure was erected by the Mamlik Sultan Inal
(reigned from 857/1453 to 865/1461) and was rebuilt by Sultan
Qaytbay in Shawwal 887/November-December 1482. Van
Berchem? deduced that the text of this restoration inscription is
in fact a slightly abbreviated version of an earlier inscription,
seen and roughly copied by Sauvaire in 1865,° which
commemorated Qaytbay’s rebuilding.

Apart from his two major surviving monuments in
Jerusalem — this sabil and the nearby madrasa — Qaytbay was
responsible also for the renovation in 874/1469 of the main
aqueduct to the city’ and for the construction of two fountains
(fisqiyya), one just to the south of the platform on which his

sabil stands and one between the two Haram gates Bab al-Silsila
and Bab al-Sakina.®
 Christel Kessler, in an article devoted to Qaytbay’s sabil,
speculated that it was built by the same team of Egyptian
craftsmen after they had completed the construction work on
Qaytbay’s madrasa some three months before the date
mentioned in the sabil’s inscription.
 "
67,"IV ARCHITECTURE
","EXTERIOR (elevations, figs. 64.3-04.0)

The sabil is an often repaired structure of three distinct ‘storeys’
(plate 64.3). A rectangular base (7.65m high) supports a
transition zone (2.18m high) carrying a short drum and pointed
dome (3.45m high). Thus the overall height is 13.28m. The
south, west and north sides of the base are pierced by large
(3.42m x 1.94m) grilled windows. The east side contains the
entrance door.

The base storey is not quite square in plan at the exterior,
being 4.60m x 4.80m. The extra length is due to the thickening
of the eastern side for the well-recess. Consequently, while the
west facade (fig. 64.5) is symmetrical, the north and south
facades (figs. 64.6 and 64.4) are asymmetrical with the window
placed somewhat west of centre in each. Engaged columns with
typical Mamliik bases and muqarnas capitals articulate the four
corners.

The ablag construction in courses of alternately red and
cream-coloured stone begins immediately west of a vertical
doubled quirked ogee moulding on the north and south
facades (figs. 64.6 and 64.4). It continues west interrupted only
by the vertical mouldings (for which cream-coloured
limestone is used throughout) through the north-west and
south-west corner shafts (plate 64.4) onto the west facade. The
north-west and south-west corner shafts are composed of
alternating courses of red and cream-coloured zig-zag
components; the cream-coloured ones are carved with
arabesque and strapwork reliefs. The interlocking voussoirs of
the window lintels (not original, see below, p. 610) are also
ablaq. A flight of four stone steps leads up to a stone shelf at the
base of the north and west windows. On the south side, where
there is no need for steps owing to the additional height of the
open-air prayer platform, an ancient sarcophagus” is placed
below the window shelf. All three stone shelves are supported
by four typically Mamlik brackets: those at the north and south
windows are similar while the two central brackets on the west
side are slightly more elaborate (fig. 64.5).

The east facade (fig. 64.3) is constructed in cream-
coloured limestone ashlar, which returns through star-
 moulding of the north and south windows where the ablaq
coursing begins. The south-east corner shaft is carved with a
repeating arabesque arranged round simple eight-pointed star
patterns and six-lobed rosettes (plate 64.5). The north-east
corner shaft is carved with a now much disfigured pattern of
strapwork in which eight-pointed stars play a role (see
reconstruction fig. 64.9). The plain entrance door (1.95m x
0.89m) is reached by four semicircular stone steps (not
original, see p. 610) resting on the pavement of the prayer
platform. Above the entrance the double moulding projects 3
cms more than elsewhere. This moulding frames a red
monolithic lintel bearing on small stalactite shoulders, a
relieving arch of ablaq joggling, and an arrangement of three
upright oblong stone tablets. Here the moulding is enriched by
hexagonal links enclosing floral bosses (plate 64.6). Clearly
this moulding, distinct from the rest, is an integral part of the
panel of decoration over the door (fig. 64.3). The moulding
extends to either side with irregularly spaced plain circular
links to form the lower border of the band of inscription which
runs around the four sides. This inscription, which contains
some Koranic verses and details of the foundation and
restorations (see above, p. 606), is surmounted by a similar
moulding. On the east face, below this moulding, an
undecorated water spout (fig. 64.3) drains rainwater from the
gutter! cut into the upper end of this storey at the foot of the
receding second storey, which is the zone of transition. Placed
where it is, the spout spills water from the gutter over that
portion of the east wall that is devoid of decoration (see fig.
64.3); any elaborate ornament here would be quickly eroded.

The zone of transition, square in plan at its base, is stepped
twice externally. The first step converts the square to an
octagon with its corners supported by half-pyramidal
buttresses” (fig. 64.10). The second step, from the octagon to
a dodecagon has a half-pyramidal buttress on each of the eight
corner facets. A pointed-arched window is placed centrally in
each side. This storey is crowned by a cyma reversa cornice
which extends on the east side round a water spout draining a
gutter cut into the twelve-sided upper surface of the transition
zone (plate 64.7).

On top of the transition zone sits in recess a plain circular
drum, two courses high, which supports the dome. The
exterior of the dome is somewhat deformed by the action of
earthquakes and the effect of unchecked vegetation, which has
eroded the pointing. The surface of the dome is covered with
sweeping arabesques, carved in low relief in a distinctive
bevelled style. The uppermost details of the decoration are
extremely difficult to distinguish since a later restoration has

at. a, fe
 obscured the carving under a layer of cement. The whole is
capped by a typical Islamic crescent finial of bronze, which,
unlike others in the Haram, faces east-west rather than north—
south.

The carving of the dome, quintessentially Egyptian in style,
shows little resemblance to Egyptian craftsmanship in the
technique of its construction. Not only is the ‘apex-seeking’
pattern less evenly and elegantly adapted to the dome surface
than in Cairo examples, but also there is no consistent
coordination between the vertical axes of the pattern and the
vertical joints in the masonry, as was hitherto a cardinal rule.’
This anomaly led Christel Kessler to suggest that the team of
Egyptian craftsmen responsible for the construction did not
include a dome specialist. She notes furthermore that the
design is not fully interpreted; that is, not all parts of the
arabesque foliage are carved out in the oblique cutting
technique usually applied to give a filigree refinement, and
where the carving is executed it is often handled in such a way
as to obscure rather than enhance the motif (e.g. the pairs of
large leaves at the lower rim, see plate 64.7). Such
imperfections are not found in any of the other arabesque
decorations elsewhere on the sabil, and therefore give the
impression that the carving of the dome, or at least part of it,
was left to hands unfamiliar with the work. Thus, Kessler
concludes, the Egyptian team was prevented somehow from
seeing the work through to its proper conclusion.
 INTERIOR (plan, fig. 64.2; sections, figs. 64.7 and 64.8)

The domed interior is 2.91m square and the floor level now
stands 1.73m above the esplanade of the Haram. The base
storey is 5.30m high, the transition zone 2.02m high and the
dome 3.32m high. The total height of the interior is therefore
10.64m.

In the internal sills of each of the main windows are two
circular openings (fig. 64.2). Underneath these openings are
water troughs. There is a bronze ring between the holes at the
north and west windows. It is said that cups (two per window)
were chained to these rings.'* Wooden planks in the middle of
the floor of stone slabs (fig. 64.2) cover another trough which
has now been partly filled with sand and houses a water-tap.

The window jambs are of ablaq construction with a
narrow (0.12m) red stone band extending upwards to frame
the decoratively carved limestone spandrels of the internal
ablaq pointed arch over each window. A shallow disk 0.13m in
diameter is cut into the stone above the keystone of each of the
three arches (fig. 64.7). The recessed tympanums of these
arches (i.e. the back of the external joggled ablag lintels) are
plastered.

The well-recess is situated in the east side to the north of
the entrance. The well and door recesses, contained by an
ablaq wall (fig. 64.8) are spanned by flat arches composed of
three stones elaborately carved with star-pattern strapwork in
relief (plate 64.8), similar to ones in the Ashrafiyya. Over these
 flat arches are two joggled relieving arches separatee Dy 4 ol te
panel of strapwork. Continuing upwards we find a plain
limestone panel surrounded by a red stone frame (fig. 64.8)
modelled at each end in a fashion similar to the external
inscription tabulae. There is no trace of an inscription on this
internal panel.

Ared stone band borders the upper end of the walls of the
square room immediately below muqarnas pendentives. This
device of providing in the interior the transition from the
square room to the round base of the dome consists of six tiers,
expanding upwards from one niche at the lowest level to six
niches at the highest (figs. 64.7 and 64.8). The pendentives are
separated by the pointed-arched clerestorey windows set in a
frame of arabesque (not shown on the sections; see plate 64.9).
A haphazard array of wooden beams now spans the space
between these windows and supports a metal hook probably
intended for the attachment of a lamp chain. The whole of the
zone of transition is ornamented with an elaboration of relief
carving. A simple moulding separates the transition zone from
the dome. In a few places there are traces indicating that the
interior of the dome was at one time whitewashed and painted
with an artificially regularized network of courses and vertical
joints. At the apex is an ablaq medallion consisting of a central
circular red stone surrounded by a cream-coloured limestone
border carved with lozenge and spear-shaped reliefs radiating
from the centre.

SEQUENCE OF CONSTRUCTION AND RESTORATION
The inscription around the exterior of the sabil (see above)
commemorates three phases of construction: first, the original
domed sabil of Sultan Inal; second, Sultan Qéaytbay’s
‘restoration’ in 887/1482; and finally, the restoration by Sultan
‘Abd al-Hamid in 1300/1883. We must now ask ourselves (1) is
there any trace of Inal’s original dome? (2) How much of
Qaytbay’s construction remains? (3) What is the extent of the
subsequent restorations? The existing structure has the
appearance of a homogeneous whole, which suggests that its
overall design dates from one particular period. There. is
nothing in the present lower courses of the masonry of the
sabil to question Mujir al-Din’s statement that Inal’s gubba was
completely destroyed. Mujir al-Din’s description leads us also
to believe that the floor ‘paved in marble’ must have been lifted
at some time, probably during the Ottoman period. The
present stone floor is therefore a later replacement.

From the evidence contained in the inscription it is clear
that there was no major restoration between Qaytbay’s original
 foundation and ‘Abd al-Hamid’s repairs of 1883. Therefore
early photographs might help us to identify those parts, in
addition to the inscription, which are not original. Only a
handful of pre-1883 illustrations’” is available but those that do
exist confirm that the restorations of 1883 took the form of
repairs rather than any major remodelling of the structure.
However, the Ordnance Survey photograph cited in note 15
shows the lintel of the north window decorated with star-
pattern strapwork; the present joggled ablag lintels of the three
principal windows and their plastered interior faces may,
therefore, all be replacements datable to 1883. At the same time
the step to the door and the north and west windows were
reconstructed. The window grilles are Ottoman in part at least.
The cement coating to the top of the dome was almost certainly
part of the 1883 repairs, while the painted coursing on the
interior of the dome, evidently applied in an effort to disguise
the unevenness of the stonework, is only presumably so.”°

The next piece of evidence we have at our disposal is the
photographs taken in the 1920s by Creswell. These show that
the sabil was almost identical then to what it is now. But a few
minor differences are discernible. The finial faced south-west
to north-east rather than east-west as now. Also, the south-west
column base was badly chipped. In fact this damaged base lies
amongst the architectural debris scattered around the Islamic
Museum on the Haram and so presumably it was removed and
replaced by the present one after 1920.""” Severe erosion of the
fifth and sixth courses above the base of the north-eastern
corner shaft may be seen in a photograph of the east facade.
These stones have since been replaced. A deterioration in the
precision of the strapwork design on these two units, and on
several parts of the south-eastern corner shaft, serves to
confirm the originality of the others. Likewise parts of the
moulding over the door are carved differently from the rest.""®
However, the 1920 photographs show a slight difference in the
colour of these stones, and suggest that they were part of the
1883 repairs. Missing circular links in the lower half of the
vertical moulding at the east end of the north side imply a
repair after the restoration of 1883. The absence today of cracks
in the masonry of the transition zone, shown in Creswell’s
photographs, further evidences some post-1920 repairs.

Thus we may conclude that in form the sabil stands today
virtually as it was built in 1482. There is no visible trace of Inal’s
original construction, and the restorations of 1883 — apart from
the window lintels — and the repairs after 1920 did little to
modify the original design.

architecture as well as the drawings, is taken from an article by C. Kessler and M.

10 C. Clermont-Ganneau, Archaeological Researches in Palestine 1873-1874,
London, 1899, 138-39, suggests that this antique sarcophagus like others around
the Haram must have come from the monument known today as the Tombs of the
Kings.

11 One stone from a fine inscription in kufic script has been re-used in the paving
of this gutter near the water spout. The epigraphic style strongly resembles that of
inscriptions found in the Fakhriyya (no. 22) and the Qubbat al-Mi'raj (built 593/
1200-1, refurbished 1195/1781), which van Berchem (CIA (Haram), 55-56, 133)
 supposed to belong to the sixth/twelfth century.

12 The sloping sides of these buttresses would have the advantage of shedding
water directly into the gutter below.

16 At the same time the vegetation that was weakening the structure was
removed. Once again a proliferation of Golden Henbane and Syrian Golden Drop
is beginning to break up the fabric of the sabil. Recently scaffolding has been
erected around the sabil with a view to repairing the stonework.

17 Also in the debris around the Museum lies a single carved stone evidently
intended to replace’ the badly eroded neck below the capital of the north-west
shaft but for some reason never fitted.

18 It should be observed that the carving of specific groups of architectural
ornament by obviously different hands does not necessarily indicate a restoration.
Undoubtedly, several masons, each with his own cutting style, would have been
employed in the construction of the sabil.

Adjoining it is the above-mentioned portico\nwhich forms the end of the eastern wall .. .!\n\nOn the west side adjacent to this gate is a vaulted portico\nhaving ten piers . . . Its [north] facade has four windows\noverlooking the Birkat Bani Isra’il, an ancient and deep\npool.\n\nAdjacent to this portico is an open space through part of\nwhich flows water to the Birkat Bani Isra’il. Part of it is an\nopen space upon which it was intended to build porticoes,\nbut up till now they have not been completed...\n\nAdjacent to this land is the Karimiyya Madrasa (no. 15).\nIt has enclosed the portico in front of it with two walls, one\nto the west and another to the east, and two ‘summer\nchambers’ have been made before it. . .\n\nAdjacent to the madrasa is a gate called Bab Hitta... In\nfront of it is a walkway paved with flagstones ... On either\nside of the gate are two little benches, each 2 dhira “(1.4m)\nwide, the eastern one abutting on the above-mentioned\nKarimiyya Madrasa and the western one adjacent to a\n portico ... in its wall there are three windows of the Ribat\nof ‘Alam al-Din al-Dawadar (no. 8). Commencing from the\neast there is a window opening on the Turba ofal-Awhad al-\nAyyabi (no. 9).\n\nAbutting on this portico is a gate known as Bab Sharaf al-\nAnbiya’ . . . In front of the latter is a walkway similar to the\none mentioned above...\n\nAbutting on this gate is a vaulted portico ... having eight\npiers. At the beginning of it are two windows, one of them\nopen [that is, ungrilled] through which is reached the\nZawiya of the Vizier Amin al-Din, Iknown as Amin al-Mulk\n(no. 21). Adjacent to both of them is a door through which\nthe Zawiyat al-Lawi is entered. Beside the gate is a platform\nwith a cistern.\n\nThis portico is adjoined on the west by another having\ntwo vaults resting on three piers... a few women here say\nthe five prayers behind the zmam. Above this portico is the\nMadrasa of the Amir Sayf al-Din al-Hajj Almalik al-Jakandar\n(no. 26) and the Khanqah of Majd al-Din al-Is‘ardi (no. 33)\nthe merchant. At the beginning of it near the cistern which\nI have mentioned are the steps which lead up to the\nmadrasa and the khanqah.\n\nAdjacent to this portico is an open space on which there\nare no porticoes. It is in the shape of a high platform\nthrough the middle of which one goes down by six steps\nto the Haram. At the highest point of this wall five windows\nof the Madrasa of the Amir ‘Alam al-Din Sanjar al-Jawili\n(no. 14)... There is no way to it from the Haram. At the end\nof this open space towards the west are two cells, each\nhaving a door opening to the south on the Haram. The\ninterior of both is entirely inside the north wall, and they\nare [cut in] the solid rock like caves. It is said that they were\nknown of old as the Cave of Abraham. In the eastern one\nis a small window. At the side of these two cells is the cell\nof the Shaykh of the Haram with two windows facing the\nHaram. Above this cell is another cell, to which one\nascends by a flight of seven steps to the edge of the door\nOpening east. ;\n\nAdjacent is a portico with two arches . . . Next to it isa\nvery long stairway from the top of which a minaret is\nascended as well as a house belonging to the Bani Jama‘a\nfamily. This minaret (no. 10) is at the farthest point of the\nwest wall of the Haram.”\n\nWit leraleslelinnaicices docamiaiim nic ammanlcoanceened wunth the\n topography of the Haram borders, Mujir al-Din is more\ninterested in chronicling the history of their construction:\n\nAs for the northern porticoes (arwiqa), they extend from\neast to west from Bab al-Asbat to the Jawiliyya Madrasa,\nwhich is known nowadays as Dar al-Niyaba (see below, p.\n205). Concerning the portico which occupies all the space\nbetween Bab al-Asbat and the Ghadiriyya Madrasa (no. 54),\nI have not been able to discover the period of its\nconstruction, but circumstances indicate that it was built at\nthe same time as the minaret there (no. 38), built during\nthe reign of the al-Ashraf Sha‘ban b. Husayn in 769/1367-68\n[but see below]. The portico below the Ghadiriyya was\nbuilt at the same time as this madrasa, and similarly the\nassembly hall of the Karimiyya.\n\nAs for the portico extending from Bab Hitta to Bab al-\nDuwaydariyya [Bab al-‘Atm], it appears that it was built by\nal-Malik al-Awhad with his Turba, which is at Bab Hitta, for\ncertain clauses in its endowment necessitate that\n[interpretation].\n\nThe portico extending from Bab al-Duwaydariyya to the\nwest end supports five madrasas. Part of it — that is under\nthe Aminiyya Madrasa and Farisiyya Madrasa (no. 30)—was\nancient. It was later reconstructed in the reign of al-\nMu‘azzam ‘Isa in the year 610/1213-14. The remainder,\nwhich is under three madrasas — the Almalikiyya, the\nIs‘ardiyya and the Subaybiyya (no. 51) — is of the same\nperiod of construction as them, each of them having been\nbuilt with the corresponding portico below. Inspection\nshows that that is so and that the construction of each\nmadrasa corresponds with that of the portico under it...\nand since the date of all the madrasas is given below, so the\ndate of construction of each of these sections of porticoes\nunder them is known.\n\nAs for the two porticoes that are under the Dar al-\nNiyaba, they were built at the same time as the Ghawanima\nMinaret (no. 10); inscribed on them is the date of their\nconstruction and that of the minaret, but the inscription\nhas become eroded over a long time. In addition, these\ntwo porticoes are surmounted by two others, a century\nmore recent. We will mention the time when the minaret\nwas constructed, which will allow an approximate idea of\nthe date of their construction. God knows best!\n The north portico is best described not according to the\nchronological sequence of its construction but in\ntopographical order, starting from the east end, following al-\n‘Umari and Mujir al-Din. In fig. 1.2 the piers supporting the\narches of the portico are numbered from 1 (east end) to 42\n(west end); the bays will be numbered in this analysis in the\nsame order so that pier 1 is the pier immediately to the left\n(west) of bay 1.\n\nBAYS 1-11\n\nThe first eleven bays of the portico — along with the single bay\nextending southwards from bay 1 against the east wall —appear\nto be structurally and architecturally homogeneous, suggesting\nthat they belong to one period of construction. The exact date\nof that construction is unknown. They are not later than c.745/\n1345 when al-‘Umari described them. Evidently they do not\nbelong to the same series as the springers in the rock scarp at\nthe west end of the north wall since the ‘pitch’ (i.e. the distance\nfrom one pier centre to the next) averages about 3.89m at the\nrock scarp as opposed to a mean of 5.28m here at the east end\nof the portico. In appearance they seem to be pre-Crusader,\nhowever. They contain no stones with Crusader tooling or\nmasons’ marks as one would expect in Crusader construction\nor in re-use in Ayyubid and early Mamlik construction (as in\nbays 21 —23 and 31 —35, for example; see below), and they bear\nno resemblance to the west portico of the Haram, which is\n wholly Mamluk. Rather they may be associated with the\nIkhshidid rebuilding of part of the east wall of the Haram\nbeside Bab al-Asbat in 350/961-62,4 or with the Fatimid\nrestorations in the Haram during the fifth/eleventh century.’\n\nMINARET BAB AL-ASBAT (no. 38)\n\nThe minaret was built in 769/1367-68 partly on top of pier 11,\nwhich forms the right-hand jamb of the minaret’s portal (see\nbelow, p. 415).\n\nBAYS 12-14\n\nThese bays are structurally and architecturally homogeneous.\nTheir date of construction is unknown. Bay 12 is built against\nthe base of the minaret in a manner clearly indicating the\npriority of the minaret. To their west stands the Ghadiriyya\nMadrasa, obviously built later than pier 14 against which it\nabuts. These three bays must therefore be dated after 769/1367-\n68, when the minaret was erected, and before 836/1432, when\nthe Ghadiriyya was built. An even closer terminus ante quem\nfor its construction is 800/1397 since that is the date before\nwhich the Tultniyya Madrasa was built. According to Mujir al-\nDin, one ascended from the stairway giving access to the\nminaret to two Mamluk madrasas, the Tuliniyya and the\nFanariyya, both built before 800/1397-98, but neither of which\nsurvives.° In his list of buildings given in topographical order\nfrom west to east, Mujir al-Din places the Tultniyya between\nthe Ghadiriyya and the Fanariyya — presumably directly over\nbays 12-14 of the portico.’\n\nBAYS 16-19\n\nThese are structurally and architecturally homogeneous. They\nare said by Mujir al-Din to have been built at the same time as\nthe Ghadiriyya in 836/1432.\n\nTHE KARIMIYYA (no. 15)\n\nThe Karimiyya, occupying the space between piers 19 and 20,\nappears originally to have had its own portico of three bays\n(below, p. 217). At some later time (perhaps at the same time as\nthe construction of the Ghadiriyya — see below, p. 217) the\nportico was converted into the Karimiyya’s assembly hall,\nwhich now stands here.\n\nBAYS 21-23\n\nThese are structurally and architecturally homogeneous. Bay\n21 in front of Bab Hitta has a fine corbel-table cornice made\nmostly from re-used Crusader material (plate 1.1). The\n\n masonry of all three bays contains a large number of re-used\nCrusader stones, many of them bearing masons’ marks. The\nexact date of construction is not known. Mujir al-Din states that\nthe portico from Bab Hitta to Bab al-‘Atm appears to have been\nbuilt by al-Malik al-Awhad when he built his tomb, but\nstructural discontinuity in the portico between bays 23 and 24\nand between bays 27 and 28 (see below) seem to indicate three\nseparate phases of construction between the two gates. Of\nthese, bays 21-23, in front of al-Awhad’s tomb, were most\nprobably built by him after he took office as Superintendent of\nthe Two Harams (694/1295) and before his endowment deed\nwas drawn up in 697/1298.\n\nBAYS 24-28\n\nThe exact date of construction of these is unknown. Bay 24\nabuts on pier 23 to the east and so they should be dated after it,\nthat is after 694/1295 (see above), and bay 27 abuts on pier 28\nto the west, which is dated 610/1213-14 (see below). The mean\npitch of these bays 24—27 is about 4.37m whereas that of the\nAyyubid portico is about 4.65m. The extra width of the bay 28\nis explained by the presence of an earlier window in the north\nwall of the Haram at this point, which necessitated the\ndisplacement of the northern vaulting springer of the portico to\nclear it (see plan, fig. 8.3). Thus we may conclude that bays 24—\n28 were built some time after 694/1295 and they must have\nexisted before 745/1345 when al-Umari described them.\n\nIt is possible that they were built along with the\nDawadariyya, which is situated immediately beyond the Haram\nwall at this point. The Dawadariyya was completed on the first\nday of 695/10 November 1295, approximately five months after\nal-Awhad took up his post as Superintendent of the Two\nHarams in Rajab 694/May-June 1295° and, therefore,\nconceivably after he had built bays 21-23. It seems more likely,\nhowever, that they belong to a second stage of al-Awhad’s\nconstruction of the Haram portico since he would have had a\nnatural desire to fill the gap between bay 23 and bay 29 (which\nis dated 610/1213-14; see below). If so, Mujir al-Din’s\ninterpretation of al-Awhad’s endowment deed becomes more\nunderstandable. A shift in alignment between bays 23 and 24\n(see plan, fig. 9.3) may be explained by the need to make this\nportico connect with the Ayyibid portico (bays 29-38) to the\nwest, something that appears not to have influenced the\nbuilders of bays 21-23. All these bays (21-28) have vertical\nextensions to the piers, which continue upwards between the\narches to form buttresses with sloping tops, evidently in\nemulation of the Ayyubid portico to the west.\n\nBAYS 29-38\nThese appear to have belonged initially to one phase of\nconstruction though they have subsequently undergone\nvarious alterations. An inscription on pier 31 gives the date of\ntheir construction: 610/1213-14.” The inscription uses the word\njuddida, signifying that the portico was a ‘renewal’, presumably\nof the portico mentioned by fourth/tenth-century geographers,\nof which only the sockets in the rock scarp to the west survive.\nSince these bays 29-38 have a mean pitch of 4.65m there is little\ndoubt that nothing of the earlier portico remained to be\nincorporated into this Ayyabid one. The ‘renewal’ was in fact a\nreplacement of the earlier portico. Mujir al-Din, following the\ntext of the inscription, states that the portico from the Bab al-\n‘Atm under the Farisiyya, i.e. bays 31-35, is ancient and was\nreconstructed under the rule of al-Malik al-Mu‘azzam ‘Isa. He\ngoes on to state that the remaining bays of the portico to the\nwest were built at the same time as the madrasas they support,\nthe Almalikiyya, the Is‘ardiyya and the Subaybiyya. This is\nlargely true but there is good reason to believe that the portico\nunder the Almalikiyya (bays 36-38) incorporates part of the\nportico of al-Mu‘azzam ‘Isa (see below).\n\nBays 29 and 30 are structurally homogeneous with bay 31,\nwhich is dated by the inscription of 610/1213-14 on its left-hand\npier. The left-hand pier of bay 29 has another inscription, also\nfrom the time of al-Mu‘azzam ‘Isa, giving the dimensions of the\n Haram.\" We can be sure, therefore, that bays 29-31 belong to\nthe same Ayyubid construction. The vertical extension of the\npiers to form buttresses with sloping tops to shed rainwater is\na Crusader technique here used for the first time in Islamic\nconstruction.\n\nBays 32-38 may also belong to this construction. Part of\npier 31 and all of pier 32 are concealed by a later staircase built\nwhen the Aminiyya above them was converted to domestic use\nsome time in the Ottoman period. The position of pier 32 may\nbe deduced from the line of the vaulting groins of bay 32 (see\nplan, fig. 21.3). Bays 33-35 under the Farisiyya have been\nrebuilt, with only the spacing between the piers to show that\nthey may originally have belonged to the Ayyibid portico. The\npiers project into the Haram about 0.70m more than piers 28—\n31 of the Ayyubid portico. Bays 36 and 37 under the Almalikiyya\nretain the spacing of the Ayyubid portico but also project about\n0.70m to the south. It is impossible now to confirm that these\nbays 33-37 were originally part of the Ayyubid portico. Yet pier\n38 follows the alignment of the Ayyubid portico and is exactly\n4.65m from the earlier part of pier 37, a dimension that\ncorresponds to the mean pitch of the Ayyubid portico, and so it\nis likely that it does indeed belong to that earlier portico.\nConsequently the piers between numbers 32 and 38 probably\nalso formed part of the Ayyabid portico but were rebuilt at\nsome later date. Piers 35 and 37 were enlarged at the time of the\nconstruction of the Almalikiyya in 741/1340 to form the bases of\nbuttresses that extend upwards to flank its facade. At the same\ntime pier 36 was completely rebuilt.\n\nThe little arched opening between piers 38 and 39 shelters\na staircase built to give access to the Almalikiyya.\n\nBAYS 40-42\n\nThese bays support the Is‘ardiyya. Bays 40 and 41 are\nstructurally and architecturally homogeneous. They belong to\nthe same period of construction as the building they support,\nthe Is‘ardiyya. The manner in which bay 42 abuts on pier 41\n(fig. 1.3) shows that it belongs to a later phase of construction.\n Al‘Umari’s enumeration of the bays of the north portico ends\nwith bay 40, implying that while bays 39 and 40 existed in his\nday, bay 41 had not yet been built (see below, p. 370).\n\nWESTWARD CONTINUATION\nBeyond the Is‘ardiyya there once stood a westward\ncontinuation of the portico, evidently built at the same time as\n the Subaybiyya and giving access to it (see above, p. 515). Now\nonly traces of springings for its vaulting survive beside bay 42;\n\nthe portico itself has disappeared.\n\nBAYS NO LONGER EXTANT\nTowards the west end of the north wall there were two bays of\n\nportico described by al-Umari and said by Mujir al-Din to have\n been built at the same time as the Minaret al-Ghawanima at the\nend of the seventh/thirteenth century. They bore an inscription\ngiving the date of construction, but this was too badly worn to\nbe deciphered by Mujir al-Din. On top of that portico stood two\nupper bays, built a century later. Nothing at all survives of these\nporticoes.\n ','BAYS, MINARET, BAYS, BAYS, BAYS, BAYS, BAYS, BAYS, WESTWARD CONTINUATION, BAYS'),(3,'In the street running up to the Gate of the Inspector (Bab al-\nNazir) stands the Hospice (7ibdt) of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir\n‘opposite the Hospice of al-Manstr’.\' A marble tablet within the\nporch contains the following inscription? In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. This\nis the wagqf of the Amir ‘Ala’ al-Din Aydughdi al-Rukni. He\nhas made a perpetual waqf of all that is within this door,\nthe vaulted rooms and the courtyard, in favour of the poor\nwho come on pilgrimage to Jerusalem the Noble, in the\nyear six hundred and sixty-six.','‘Ala’ al-Din Aydughdi was a mamluk of the Ayyubid sultan, al-\nSalih Najm al-Din Ayyab.* He moved to the service of Baybars\n—hence in all probability the appellation al-Rukni — and in late\n660/1262 was sent on a secret mission to arrest Taybars al-\nWaziri, the governor of Damascus. He became blind and went\nto reside in Jerusalem, where he served as Superintendent of\nthe Two Harams (Jerusalem and Hebron) both for Baybars and\nal-Mansiir Qalawtn. He had a reputation for good government\n—‘in his days the waqfs flourished and their yield multiplied? —\n and for piety and sagacity. His own foundations were\nnumerous. In addition to the hospice, he built an ablutions\nplace (mathara) for the mosque at Medina, paved the platform\n(sabn) around the Dome of the Rock, and erected a building\nnear the mosque at Hebron, which included ovens and mills\nwith storerooms for wheat and barley above. He also increased\nthe daily charitable distribution in Hebron.® In addition Mujir\nal-Din appears to say that ‘Ala’ al-Din repaired both the\nablutions area of the Haram in Jerusalem and the gate leading\nto it.” In 665/1266-7 he carried out works on the water supply to\nthe Haram and its immediate western surroundings. He overcame his loss of sight and was a respected and\nactive administrator. It is said that he was able to trace the\nfoundations for a bath-house at Hebron and mark them with\nlime for the builders, although only Ibn Taghribirdi, the\nfifteenth-century historian, spells out that he was blind at the\ntime. He took great delight too in the breeding of blood-stock\nand always recognised his own horses.” The happy epithet al-\nBasir (insightful) was applied to him. In time, by a not\nuncommon process, his tomb — he died in Shawwal 693/\nAugust-September 1294 and was buried within his hospice —\nwas converted into a holy place.’ By 994/1537,\"\" and regularly\nthereafter , he is referred to in the Jerusalem Sijills as wali Allah\n(saint) and as shaykh.','The Ottoman land register, Defter no. 522, contains a relatively\nlong summary of the waqf of ‘Ala’ al-Din. The date of the\nwagfiyya is there said to be 741/1340-1, which is one year\nearlier than the date of the mahbdar mentioned by Mujir al-Din\n(see above). A translation of the sijill entry follows:\'* The waqf of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir. After the upkeep of the\nhospice, the two cisterns in it and its special ablutions\nplace (mathara), and of the rest of the property of the\nwagqf, the administrator should pay to the caretaker’ of the\nhospice aforementioned eight dirhams monthly. His duty\nis to sweep, lock up and open, and clean the hospice,\nto... ! the ablutions place, to light the lamps, that is two\nlamps every night until morning, one in the assembly hall\n(majma’) of the hospice and the other in the ablutions\nplace. [He should issue him] a half rotl of bread according\nto the Jerusalem measure each day. The administrator\nshould pay what he thinks fit to purchase rope, buckets,\nlamps (ganddil), ewers and mats to furnish” the assembly\nhall which is in the aforementioned hospice. What\n remains after that he should expend to buy medium-\nquality bread and distribute it to the poor and indigent\nwho come to this hospice, to each one daily two rotls of the\naforementioned bread according to the Egyptian measure\n—for five days, beyond which period the distribution [to an\nindividual] should not continue. If it proves difficult to\ndistribute to each person for five days, then let it be done\nfor three days. If the visitors are numerous and the waqf\ncannot manage to satisfy all, the firstcomers shall be given\nprecedence over those poor who come after them. The\nadministration of the hospice and its endowments shall be\nin the hands of the Imam for the time being at the Dome\nof the Rock.

The qadi allowed\nthe mutawalli of the waqf to effect a six-year lease of the land\n(to be ploughed and planted with various fruit trees and vines)\nfor 420 paras.”!\n SUBSEQUENT HISTORY\nThe waqf properties of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir appear five times to\nour knowledge in the Haram documents. The hospice itself is\nalluded to only once, in connection with the death ofa resident,\nthe Shaykh ‘Umar al-Sharafi, in 796/1394.” Otherwise the wagf\nproperties of the hospice are three times mentioned as the\nresidence or lodging of persons.” In another case the west\nboundary of a house near the Patriarch’s Pool is given as the\nsquare (al-rahba), the waqf of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir.** Finally —\nand it is the earliest mention — in 747/1346 three contiguous\nshops ‘built by the father of the vendor’ were sold for 780\ndirhams. They are described as ‘standing on land given as\nendowment to the hospice of the Amir ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Rukni...\nThese shops are... near the covered market (qaysariyya) of the\nlate Amir Sayf al-Din Tankiz . . .”? Perhaps these shops were\ndevelopments of the items (vi) and (vii) in the list above. Since\nthere are no plots of land in the list of endowments, on which\nthe vendor’s father could have built his shops, it does appear\nthat the earliest buildings, perhaps already ruinous, had been\nsold by the waqf, which retained only an interest in the land, to\nthe extent of one silver dirham as a monthly ground-rent. The Defter no. 522 records a later waqf in favour of the\nhospice as follows:”°\n ES sho The waqf of Mahmud Stghanji (?) for the hospice of the\nabove-mentioned [‘Ala@ al-Din] and with the same\nconditions.

This\nis the wagqf of the Amir ‘Ala’ al-Din Aydughdi al-Rukni. He\nhas made a perpetual waqf of all that is within this door,\nthe vaulted rooms and the courtyard, in favour of the poor\nwho come on pilgrimage to Jerusalem the Noble, in the\nyear six hundred and sixty-six.\n\nDATE\n\nThe date, 666/1267-8, is confirmed by Mujir al-Din, but\npresumably on the strength of the inscription since he says:\n‘. . No waqf document of his survived, so his charitable\ndonation was authenticated before the Qadi and the document\n(mahdar) confirming its legal status was drawn up and dated\nThursday, 18 Rabi‘ II, 742 [Thursday, 4 October 1341].”\n\nFOUNDER\n\n‘Ala’ al-Din Aydughdi was a mamluk of the Ayyubid sultan, al-\nSalih Najm al-Din Ayyab.* He moved to the service of Baybars\n—hence in all probability the appellation al-Rukni — and in late\n660/1262 was sent on a secret mission to arrest Taybars al-\nWaziri, the governor of Damascus. He became blind and went\nto reside in Jerusalem, where he served as Superintendent of\nthe Two Harams (Jerusalem and Hebron) both for Baybars and\nal-Mansiir Qalawtn. He had a reputation for good government\n—‘in his days the waqfs flourished and their yield multiplied? —\n and for piety and sagacity. His own foundations were\nnumerous. In addition to the hospice, he built an ablutions\nplace (mathara) for the mosque at Medina, paved the platform\n(sabn) around the Dome of the Rock, and erected a building\nnear the mosque at Hebron, which included ovens and mills\nwith storerooms for wheat and barley above. He also increased\nthe daily charitable distribution in Hebron.® In addition Mujir\nal-Din appears to say that ‘Ala’ al-Din repaired both the\nablutions area of the Haram in Jerusalem and the gate leading\nto it.” In 665/1266-7 he carried out works on the water supply to\nthe Haram and its immediate western surroundings.\n\nHe overcame his loss of sight and was a respected and\nactive administrator. It is said that he was able to trace the\nfoundations for a bath-house at Hebron and mark them with\nlime for the builders, although only Ibn Taghribirdi, the\nfifteenth-century historian, spells out that he was blind at the\ntime. He took great delight too in the breeding of blood-stock\nand always recognised his own horses.” The happy epithet al-\nBasir (insightful) was applied to him. In time, by a not\nuncommon process, his tomb — he died in Shawwal 693/\nAugust-September 1294 and was buried within his hospice —\nwas converted into a holy place.’ By 994/1537,\"\" and regularly\nthereafter , he is referred to in the Jerusalem Sijills as wali Allah\n(saint) and as shaykh.\n\nENDOWMENT\n\nThe Ottoman land register, Defter no. 522, contains a relatively\nlong summary of the waqf of ‘Ala’ al-Din. The date of the\nwagfiyya is there said to be 741/1340-1, which is one year\nearlier than the date of the mahbdar mentioned by Mujir al-Din\n(see above). A translation of the sijill entry follows:\'*\n\nThe waqf of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir. After the upkeep of the\nhospice, the two cisterns in it and its special ablutions\nplace (mathara), and of the rest of the property of the\nwagqf, the administrator should pay to the caretaker’ of the\nhospice aforementioned eight dirhams monthly. His duty\nis to sweep, lock up and open, and clean the hospice,\nto... ! the ablutions place, to light the lamps, that is two\nlamps every night until morning, one in the assembly hall\n(majma’) of the hospice and the other in the ablutions\nplace. [He should issue him] a half rotl of bread according\nto the Jerusalem measure each day. The administrator\nshould pay what he thinks fit to purchase rope, buckets,\nlamps (ganddil), ewers and mats to furnish” the assembly\nhall which is in the aforementioned hospice. What\n remains after that he should expend to buy medium-\nquality bread and distribute it to the poor and indigent\nwho come to this hospice, to each one daily two rotls of the\naforementioned bread according to the Egyptian measure\n—for five days, beyond which period the distribution [to an\nindividual] should not continue. If it proves difficult to\ndistribute to each person for five days, then let it be done\nfor three days. If the visitors are numerous and the waqf\ncannot manage to satisfy all, the firstcomers shall be given\nprecedence over those poor who come after them. The\nadministration of the hospice and its endowments shall be\nin the hands of the Imam for the time being at the Dome\nof the Rock.

The qadi allowed\nthe mutawalli of the waqf to effect a six-year lease of the land\n(to be ploughed and planted with various fruit trees and vines)\nfor 420 paras.”!\n SUBSEQUENT HISTORY\nThe waqf properties of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir appear five times to\nour knowledge in the Haram documents. The hospice itself is\nalluded to only once, in connection with the death ofa resident,\nthe Shaykh ‘Umar al-Sharafi, in 796/1394.” Otherwise the wagf\nproperties of the hospice are three times mentioned as the\nresidence or lodging of persons.” In another case the west\nboundary of a house near the Patriarch’s Pool is given as the\nsquare (al-rahba), the waqf of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir.** Finally —\nand it is the earliest mention — in 747/1346 three contiguous\nshops ‘built by the father of the vendor’ were sold for 780\ndirhams. They are described as ‘standing on land given as\nendowment to the hospice of the Amir ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Rukni...\nThese shops are... near the covered market (qaysariyya) of the\nlate Amir Sayf al-Din Tankiz . . .”? Perhaps these shops were\ndevelopments of the items (vi) and (vii) in the list above. Since\nthere are no plots of land in the list of endowments, on which\nthe vendor’s father could have built his shops, it does appear\nthat the earliest buildings, perhaps already ruinous, had been\nsold by the waqf, which retained only an interest in the land, to\nthe extent of one silver dirham as a monthly ground-rent.\n\nThe Defter no. 522 records a later waqf in favour of the\nhospice as follows:”°\n ES sho\n\nThe waqf of Mahmud Stghanji (?) for the hospice of the\nabove-mentioned [‘Ala@ al-Din] and with the same\nconditions.

They are of African origin, coming from Darfur\n[western Sudan] and its environs. The Turkish\nGovernment employed them in police matters and by\nagreement gave them the guardianship of the madrasas\nwhich were situated in the dwellings (dr), residences\n(mandazil) and porticoes (arwiga) around the west and\nnorth sides of the Haram. The performance of these duties\ngave them the right to live there. They were always loyal to\nthe State. They are black, tall, strongly built. They were\n given, by agreement, the guardianship of the gates of the\nHaram, for it was forbidden for Christians and foreigners\nto enter the Haram, and there was trouble for anyone who\ntried to go against this order and to approach any one of\nthe gates, even princes and kings of foreign nations:\nentrance to the Haram was forbidden to them except by\npermission of the Tukarina, and they were unlikely to\nallow this to any non-Muslim. We see this rule most vividly\nin the middle of the nineteenth century [1855] when the\nMutasarrif of Jerusalem was obliged to imprison the\nTukarina so as to enable a king to visit the Haram.** These\ntwo ribats were made into a prison at the end of the\nTurkish period. In one of them, the southern one [i.e. the\nManstri Ribat], were kept those in custody awaiting\njudgment, and in the other those who had been sentenced.\nThis was called the ‘Prison of Blood’ (sijn al-dam). And so\nthings remained until the British occupation when the\nEnglish moved the prison to the place now known as al-\nMuskawbiyya.” Nowadays they are inhabited only by the\npoor Tukarina who live by begging.”\n\nWhen van Berchem last visited Jerusalem, in 1914, these two\nribats were still in use as prisons. Now their courtyards are full\nof modern huts providing accommodation for the bulk of\nJerusalem’s African community; delightful _ people\ncharacterized by a disarming blend of African joie de vivre and\nArab hospitality.\n ','IDENTIFICATION, DATE, FOUNDER, ENDOWMENT, TATER VISTORVY'),(5,'The building is fully indentified by an excellently preserved\nfoundation inscription which is situated to the rear of the large\nporch above the lintel of the door.

The document contains\nboth the report of the waqf office (diwan al-wagf) on\navailability, and the order for the transfer of the allowance,\nemanating — from whom? There is no clear indication but\nperhaps the author of the marstim Gli (exalted order) was the\nSuperintendent of the Two Harams.\n\nOTTOMAN PERIOD\n\nThe inspector of the waqfs of the hospice in the earliest\nsurviving sijill is the Shaykh Badr al-Din b. Muhyi al-Din b.\nJama‘a, mentioned in an acknowledgement of a debt to the\nwadf of 200 Aleppo silver pieces by an inhabitant of Tayyibat al-\nIsm, which is dated 937/1530.\"4\n\nAs in the Haram documents, there are references to the\ndeath of inmates. For instance, a resident Sufi (fagir mujawir)\ndied in 938/1532. His cell had been sealed and remained so\nuntil an official from the court came to make an inventory of his\npossessions. Iskandar al-Rimi, for that was his name, left a\nconsiderable sum of money in various currencies. The total is\ngiven in Aleppo silver, that is 10,835, the equivalent of 4,334\naspers. Another resident, Shaykh Ahmad al-Jabarti, who died in\n952/1545, left property valued at 57 paras.”\n\nThe mechanism whereby the farm of waqf resources was\noffered in a form of auction is clear from two sets of documents\nin the Court registers. On 9 Ramadan 941/14 March 1535 two\nmen in partnership, the Qadi ‘Abd al-‘Aziz b. Muhammad b.\nNusayba al-Khazraji and the Qadi Abt’l-Ma‘ali al-Dayri al-\nHanafi, guaranteed 17,000 aspers to the administrator of the\nwaqf for the current year.\'° There was express provision that\nthe two should be paid 500 aspers if anyone else should offer a\nlarger guaranteed sum to the waqf. This happened the next day,\nwhen the Bolukbashi Sinan b. ‘Abdallah (the company\ncommander of the Citadel in Jerusalem) proposed 18,000\naspers.!’ Then on 12 Ramadan/17 March the Shaykh Aba’l-\n Haram b. al-Qalqashandi stated the rent he was prepared to\npay, 19,000 aspers.\'* Similarly in 935/1546 the then lessor, a\nmember of the al-Dayri family, accepted a rent of 2,100 aspers\nfor a five year lease of a house and stable in the Bab al-Nazir\ndistrict from Shams al-Din Muhammad b. Sarim al-Din\nIbrahim. Three days later he accepted the sum of 13 Cypriot\ngold coins and 30 paras from a Sinan Khalifa b. Isma‘il for the\nsame property and the same period.” This same Sinan was\nallowed to become deputy for the administrator Sharaf al-Din\n‘Isa b, Shams al-Din Muhammad b. al-Misri in Rajab 964/May\n1557.\n\nThree other lease contracts were noted. In Ramadan 952/\nNovember 1545 the plantation outside Gaza was leased by a\nlocal man for three years at 1,000 aspers annually.” In one,\nMustafa Celebi, described as Superintendent of the Two\nHarams, leased from the inspector of this waqf some\nunproductive and unbuilt-on land in Bab al-Nazir district for\nthirty years at a pepper-corn rent of 60 paras for the whole\nperiod, and with express permission to build on the site.??\nAnother Haram official and perhaps a relative of the above,\nHamza Celebi b. Mahmid Celebi, clerk to the waqfs of the Two\nHarams, rented practically all the agricultural properties of the\nhospice waqf for three years beginning 1 Dhw’l-Qa‘da 962/17\nSeptember 1555 for an annual rent of 325 gold pieces. An\ninteresting addition in the contract stipulates that the waqf is\nalso to receive a thousandth part of each year’s produce. The\nremainder is to go to the contractor (musdaqi). 2\n\nFor a series of accounts which show the application of the\nwagf income, see the table on p. 132.\n\nAllowances and the use of one of the hospice’s cells,\ntogether with the daily allowance which went with that right,\nwere inherited or surrendered for a consideration to others.\nThe assignment through the court had no doubt become a\nformality. In Dhu\'l-Hijja 984/February 1577 a man succeeded\nhis deceased brother in the enjoyment of a daily third of a rotl\nof bread (a third of a full allowance, murattab).“* An individual\nsurrendered to another ‘his room (Aura), his residence in the\nMansiri Hospice, along with the allowance, which is worth one\nasper daily’, in Sha‘ban 986/October 1578.” The right to reside\nin a room ‘in the south range (al-saff al-qgibiz), and the daily\nasper were granted to a Nasim b. Hasan al-‘Ajami, to replace\nHasan b. Muhammad al-Bawardi, by his misba, another\n‘easterner’. This was in Rajab 1018/October 1609.”° Another fifty\nyears later similar rights were still being recorded. Shaykh Zayn\nal-‘Arab b. ‘Abd al-Qadir b. Abi al-Lutf, on the death of another,\ntook up residence in his cell (kbalwa) ‘at the east end of the\nsouth range’ in Shawwal 1071/June 1661.7”\n\nFrom a report made in Shawwal 1071/June 1661 it may be\ninferred that the governor of Nablus collected as tax some\nproportion of the waqf income, which was stored in the\nhospice for him. Faraj Bey sent his man, Jamshid Agha, to\nJerusalem concerning the loss of wheat, barley and lentils of\nhis, stored in a room to the left of the hospice entrance. The\nlock was found to be defective and the store clerk (Ratib al-\nghildl), a Christian, suggested that many people knew how to\ngain access, but Jamshid was told ‘no suspicion could be\nattached to the inhabitants of the hospice because some were\nmen of religious learning (abi al- tlm) and others men of piety,\nreligion and felicity’.”*\n\nLATER HISTORY\n\nIn Ottoman times this ribat, like ‘Ala’ al-Din’s opposite (no. 3),\nhoused the Sudanese African Haram guards and, later on, a\nprison. In 1914 it was still in use as a prison. Today the\ncourtyard is full of shanties, the homes of members of\nTerusalem’s African communitv ( Dlate 5.15).\n ','IDENTIFICATION, DATE, FOUNDER, ENDOWMENT, MAMLUK PERIOD, OTTOMAN PERIOD, LATER HISTORY'),(6,'','','','','\n\nA dedicatory inscription above the entrance records that:\n\n...

There is no reason at all to believe that\nKurt\'s Hospice was reserved for women. Other texts refer to a\n‘Hospice of the Sultan’ in the quarter of Bab al-Hadid (see pp.\n131, 343 n. 6, and 557).\n STREET FRONTAGE (fig. 7.5) The present street frontage is three storeys high, but only the\nlowest storey belongs to the Ribat of Kurt al-Mansiri. The\nmiddle storey was added in 844/1440 with the adjoining\nconstruction of the Jawhariyya Madrasa (no. 58) as shown by\nthe continuity of the masonry. There is a slight bend in the street\nalignment corresponding to the junction between the ribat and\nthe later madrasa (fig. 7.3). The lateral extent and the height of\nthe ribat may also be seen in a horizontal quirked ogee\nmoulding, which must originally have formed a cornice as the\nwater spout near the middle of the moulding, implying a roof\nbehind, shows (plate 7.1). The diminutive entrance doorway (plate 7.2) is set in a\nshallow recess with a slightly stilted pointed arch at the eastern\nend of the frontage, next to Bab al-Hadid. The usual stone\nbenches flanking the doorway have been built up at some time\n after 1920 when Creswell’s photograph (plate 7.2) was taken. A\nrelieving arch over the lintel is composed of three voussoirs\nwith rebated joints, and above, in the tympanum of the arched\nrecess, a small window (now blocked) is discernible. In the western part of the frontage an irregular half-arch,\naround which the stonework is recessed two or three\ncentimetres, is obviously a later repair (plate 7.1). The apex of\nthis half-arch coincides with the abutment of a relatively\nmodern strainer arch spanning the street at this point to\nbuttress the frontage against the Arghtiniyya Madrasa opposite.\nFrom the presence of a lintel stone and the disposition of the\nmasonry below it (fig. 7.5), it appears that there was once a\nwindow in the western half of the frontage intended to light the\nmain hall of the ribat (see plan, fig. 7.3).\n INTERIOR (jig. 7.3) (@) The southern structures The entrance doorway opens into a long passage (plate 7.3)\nwhich runs north into a small yard open to the sky, from which\nan archway on the west (now partly blocked) leads into a cross-\nyaulted antechamber to the main hall of the ribat lying to the\nwest of the passage. The doorway to the main hall is placed\neccentrically in the south wall of the antechamber, it is\nunremarkable apart from the unusual feature of flanking stone\nbenches on the inside.”® The corners of the hall are extruded in\norder to reduce the span of the cross vault. In the middle of the\nhall there is a buttress (see fig. 7.3) which was added later; its\nfunction, to support the floor above, is further confirmation\nthat the first floor is a later addition, as indicated by the masonry\nof the frontage. Above the entrance passage there is a low narrow room\n(dotted lines on plan, fig. 7.3) originally reached by a staircase\nin the thickness of the wall separating the passage from the\nmain hall. This is now blocked and the room is accessible only\nby climbing through a window in its north wall. There was a\nsecond small window at the south end of the room, looking out\nabove the entrance portal. The ceiling of the room is at the\nsame level as that of the main hall. Its different alignment and lack of structural integration\nshow that the antechamber is a later addition to the main hall.\n(ii) Courtyard\nFrom the small yard beside the antechamber a passageway\n leads northward to the courtyard of the ribat. On either side of\nthe passageway are groups of structures of a later date than the\nmain hall. Those on the west side, reached by a door in the\nnorth wall of the antechamber, are too dilapidated and overlaid\nwith debris for their period to be established. From the quality\nof the stone dressing, both they and the antechamber appear to\nbe pre-Ottoman and could well form part of the Jawhariyya\nadditions made in 844/1440 (p. 562). To the east of the\npassageway and against the Haram wall are two cells (marked\n‘B’ and ‘C’ on the plan) with doors (both blocked) in the north\nand south walls respectively. Six out of nine pointed arches in\nthese later additions have the unusual feature of a median joint\n(plate 7.4). Several arches in the Jawhariyya share this feature. The courtyard is dominated by the high wall of the Haram\n(see below) which forms its east boundary. The original west\nboundary is indeterminate: the lower part of the present wall is\nburied under a heap of rubble (plate 7.5). It seems very likely\nthat the original west boundary was in line with the west wall of\nthe main hall. (iti) Northern structures At the north end of the courtyard the buildings have no direct\nstructural connection with those parts of the ribat that confront\nthe street. This lack of connection and the absence of distinctive\narchitectural features make it very difficult to determine which\nparts may belong to the original ribat. To make matters worse,\nmany of the structures at ground level are now sealed off and\ninaccessible. Nevertheless, certain elements are manifestly\nOttoman and by eliminating these we can reduce the number\nof possible components of the ribat. At the north end of the courtyard is an zwvdan composed of\ntwo vaults, of which the outer one facing the courtyard (plate\n7.6) is higher and, like the structure it supports, is obviously\nOttoman. The priority of the inner vault upon which the outer\nvault abuts is indisputable. The stonework of the inner vault is\ndressed in a manner similar to that of the street frontage and we\nbelieve that this zwvdém forms part of the original construction.\nThere were two blocked openings in the rear (north) wall; both\nare blocked now. During repairs made in 1971-72 these\nopenings were unblocked briefly (see plate 7.7), but the\nheavily plastered walls and vaults of the chamber thus revealed\nbetrayed no distinctive characteristics. However, the vaulted\nceiling is somewhat lower than that of the zwdn (see fig. 7.6)\nand this leads us tentatively to suggest that this northern\nchamber is earlier, possibly connected with the Ayyubid\n structures to the north which come between the Mansuri Ribat\nand the Haram wall (above, p. 132). There are two openings in the west wall of the inner vault\nof the zvdn. The northern one is blocked and remained so\nduring the aforementioned repairs; nothing is known of the\narea beyond. The one to the south houses a staircase leading to\nthe upper floor. At the head of the staircase (plate 7.8) there are two\npassages which lead (a) west to connect ultimately with the roof\nof the Ribat al-Manstri and (b) east (plate 7.9) into a much-\npartitioned yard overshadowed by the Haram wall to the east\nand a three-storey Ottoman addition to the north (see fig. 7.6).\nFrom their architectural relationship, the zwan, the staircase\nand the small room immediately to the north of it at first floor\nlevel as well as the cross-vaulted room directly over the inner\nvault of the 7wan may be contemporaneous, i.e. be part of the\noriginal ribat. Other rooms at first floor level may also belong\nto the ribat but the anonymity of the architecture precludes\npositive identification. At second and third floor levels the\narchitecture is easily identified as Ottoman in its entirety (plate\n7.10).','IDENTIFICATION\n\nAlthough the building is anepigraphic, identification is quite\neasy as Mujir al-Din described it as being ‘at the Iron Gate,\ncontiguous with the wall [of the Haram and] opposite the\nArghiiniyya Madrasa’.* As there was no direct access from the\nhospice into the Haram enclosure, al-‘Umari made no mention\nof the Ribat Kurt in his descriptive work.\n\nFOUNDER\n\nIf we continue with Mujir al-Din’s text’, we read: ‘It was\nendowed by his honour (al-maqarr)° Sayf al-Din Kurt, saihib\n(sic) of Egypt, in the year 693 [1294].

A\nrelieving arch over the lintel is composed of three voussoirs\nwith rebated joints, and above, in the tympanum of the arched\nrecess, a small window (now blocked) is discernible.\n\nIn the western part of the frontage an irregular half-arch,\naround which the stonework is recessed two or three\ncentimetres, is obviously a later repair (plate 7.1). The apex of\nthis half-arch coincides with the abutment of a relatively\nmodern strainer arch spanning the street at this point to\nbuttress the frontage against the Arghtiniyya Madrasa opposite.\nFrom the presence of a lintel stone and the disposition of the\nmasonry below it (fig. 7.5), it appears that there was once a\nwindow in the western half of the frontage intended to light the\nmain hall of the ribat (see plan, fig. 7.3).\n INTERIOR (jig. 7.3)\n\n(@) The southern structures\n\nThe entrance doorway opens into a long passage (plate 7.3)\nwhich runs north into a small yard open to the sky, from which\nan archway on the west (now partly blocked) leads into a cross-\nyaulted antechamber to the main hall of the ribat lying to the\nwest of the passage. The doorway to the main hall is placed\neccentrically in the south wall of the antechamber, it is\nunremarkable apart from the unusual feature of flanking stone\nbenches on the inside.”® The corners of the hall are extruded in\norder to reduce the span of the cross vault. In the middle of the\nhall there is a buttress (see fig. 7.3) which was added later; its\nfunction, to support the floor above, is further confirmation\nthat the first floor is a later addition, as indicated by the masonry\nof the frontage.\n\nAbove the entrance passage there is a low narrow room\n(dotted lines on plan, fig. 7.3) originally reached by a staircase\nin the thickness of the wall separating the passage from the\nmain hall. This is now blocked and the room is accessible only\nby climbing through a window in its north wall. There was a\nsecond small window at the south end of the room, looking out\nabove the entrance portal. The ceiling of the room is at the\nsame level as that of the main hall.\n\nIts different alignment and lack of structural integration\nshow that the antechamber is a later addition to the main hall.\n(ii) Courtyard\nFrom the small yard beside the antechamber a passageway\n leads northward to the courtyard of the ribat. On either side of\nthe passageway are groups of structures of a later date than the\nmain hall. Those on the west side, reached by a door in the\nnorth wall of the antechamber, are too dilapidated and overlaid\nwith debris for their period to be established. From the quality\nof the stone dressing, both they and the antechamber appear to\nbe pre-Ottoman and could well form part of the Jawhariyya\nadditions made in 844/1440 (p. 562). To the east of the\npassageway and against the Haram wall are two cells (marked\n‘B’ and ‘C’ on the plan) with doors (both blocked) in the north\nand south walls respectively. Six out of nine pointed arches in\nthese later additions have the unusual feature of a median joint\n(plate 7.4). Several arches in the Jawhariyya share this feature.\n\nThe courtyard is dominated by the high wall of the Haram\n(see below) which forms its east boundary. The original west\nboundary is indeterminate: the lower part of the present wall is\nburied under a heap of rubble (plate 7.5). It seems very likely\nthat the original west boundary was in line with the west wall of\nthe main hall.\n\n(iti) Northern structures\n\nAt the north end of the courtyard the buildings have no direct\nstructural connection with those parts of the ribat that confront\nthe street. This lack of connection and the absence of distinctive\narchitectural features make it very difficult to determine which\nparts may belong to the original ribat. To make matters worse,\nmany of the structures at ground level are now sealed off and\ninaccessible. Nevertheless, certain elements are manifestly\nOttoman and by eliminating these we can reduce the number\nof possible components of the ribat.\n\nAt the north end of the courtyard is an zwvdan composed of\ntwo vaults, of which the outer one facing the courtyard (plate\n7.6) is higher and, like the structure it supports, is obviously\nOttoman. The priority of the inner vault upon which the outer\nvault abuts is indisputable. The stonework of the inner vault is\ndressed in a manner similar to that of the street frontage and we\nbelieve that this zwvdém forms part of the original construction.\nThere were two blocked openings in the rear (north) wall; both\nare blocked now. During repairs made in 1971-72 these\nopenings were unblocked briefly (see plate 7.7), but the\nheavily plastered walls and vaults of the chamber thus revealed\nbetrayed no distinctive characteristics. However, the vaulted\nceiling is somewhat lower than that of the zwdn (see fig. 7.6)\nand this leads us tentatively to suggest that this northern\nchamber is earlier, possibly connected with the Ayyubid\n structures to the north which come between the Mansuri Ribat\nand the Haram wall (above, p. 132).\n\nThere are two openings in the west wall of the inner vault\nof the zvdn. The northern one is blocked and remained so\nduring the aforementioned repairs; nothing is known of the\narea beyond. The one to the south houses a staircase leading to\nthe upper floor.\n\nAt the head of the staircase (plate 7.8) there are two\npassages which lead (a) west to connect ultimately with the roof\nof the Ribat al-Manstri and (b) east (plate 7.9) into a much-\npartitioned yard overshadowed by the Haram wall to the east\nand a three-storey Ottoman addition to the north (see fig. 7.6).\nFrom their architectural relationship, the zwan, the staircase\nand the small room immediately to the north of it at first floor\nlevel as well as the cross-vaulted room directly over the inner\nvault of the 7wan may be contemporaneous, i.e. be part of the\noriginal ribat. Other rooms at first floor level may also belong\nto the ribat but the anonymity of the architecture precludes\npositive identification. At second and third floor levels the\narchitecture is easily identified as Ottoman in its entirety (plate\n7.10).\n\nHARAM WALL\nThe outer face of the Haram wall,” which forms the eastern\nboundary of the ribat, is exposed along the length of the\ncourtyard (plate 7.11). This affords us a rare opportunity to\nexamine a continuous stretch of the wall in relation to the\nadjoining Mamluk structures. The two lowest courses, each\napproximately 0.90m high, seem to belong to the Umayyad\nrebuilding of the wall since the stone dressing and the height of\nthe courses correspond closely to that of the masonry at those\nHaram gates which we have ascribed (above, p. 45) to the\nUmayyad period (cf. below, pp. 156 and 174). Above these two\ncourses the smaller masonry of the wall appears to be\nhomogeneous (apart from isolated repairs) to the very top, a\nheight corresponding to the roof of the Mamlik portico (no.\n12). A systematic survey of the masonry types in Jerusalem is\nneeded to determine whether the upper part of the wall\nbelongs to a phase of Umayyad construction or, as seems more\nlikely, to a later reconstruction. All that can be safely inferred at\npresent is that this part of the wall was built before the ribat\nwhich abuts it.\n AYU\n\n1 The name of the founder is spelt variously Kurd and Kurt in Mamluk sources:\nof seven historians who mention Kurt/Kurd al-Mansiri, three use ‘Kurt’, two use\n‘Kurd’ and two, Mufaddal and al-Maqrizi, use both indiscriminately. In Turkish\ndialects there is a tendency not to distinguish between voiced and un-voiced final\nconsonants; thus kurt/kurd/kurt, ‘wolf (Sir Gerard Clauson, An Etymological\nDictionary of Pre-Thirteenth Century Turkish, Oxford, 1972, 648). The spelling\nKurt has been adopted, which, though not the spelling used by Mujir al-Din, is\nnonetheless the commonest in the sources. This spelling also avoids confusion\npossible with Kurd, which might be taken erroneously to imply a Kurdish origin.\n\n2 Two steps leading up to the Arghiiniyya are visible in Creswell’s photograph\n(plate 32.2) taken in 1920, whereas nowadays only one anda half steps are visible.\n\n3 A brief description of the building is given in: M.

The fagade above the\nportico is remarkable for the variety of its architectural features,\nnotably a fine double-arched window flanked by columns, a\ngroup of three rectangular windows with a small blind triple\nwindow above all set in a shallow recess, and a blocked\ndoorway half-way up the wall with no obvious means of\napproach.*4 Under the central part of the facade runs a billet\nmoulding which recurs in the western part of the facade at a\nhigher level above the doorway. The upper floor over the portico was taken by van\nBerchem”? to be part of the khanqah. But we have the literary\nevidence of Mujir al-Din*® that there is a certain Basitiyya\nMadrasa (no. 53) built in the ninth/fifteenth century ‘partly\nover’ (ba‘duba ald) the Dawadariyya. Certain features of the\nfacade confirm Mujir al-Din’s statement. Three in particular,\nthe muqarnas decoration of the voussoirs of the doorway\narch,” the small twin window with a circular window above®®\nand the billet moulding,” were not introduced to Jerusalem\nuntil the ninth/fifteenth century. Consequently the upper floor,\nover the portico, should be considered as belonging not to the\nkhangah butto the Basitiyya Madrasa (see below, pp.519-525). The frontage of the khanq&h itself is obscured by the\nHaram portico“ and is devoid of pretension, being punctuated\nonly by five rectangular windows.*! The two westernmost\nwindows open in infill walls blocking two round-headed\narchways (plate 8.1) identical in form to the archway of the\npresent Bab al-‘Atm. All three archways were originally open,\nforming a triple gateway into the Haram, built probably in\nUmayyad times (see above, p. 45). The jambs of both windows\nare built partly of ablag masonry and the flat relieving arches\nabove the monolithic lintels are decorated with red ablaq\nvoussoirs identical to those of the relieving arches over the\nwindows in the north wall of the assembly hall (see below, p.\n162). Therefore we may assume that these two eastern bays of\nthe triple gateway were blocked up at the time of construction\nof the khanqah. The central window must be contemporaneous\n with the western ones. It is the same size as the western\nwindows and has similar ablag jambs but lacks their decorated\nrelieving arches. It may well take the place ofan earlier opening\nmade in the Haram wall before the construction of the portico,\nfor the vaulting of the adjacent bay of the portico is awkwardly\narranged in order to avoid blocking the window (fig. 8.3). The\ntwo eastern windows are quite plain. Their splayed embrasures\nin the Haram wall are skewed in order (a) to place the western\nwindow under the centre ofa portico vault (see fig. 8.3) and (b)\nto allow the eastern window to clear the springing of the\nadjacent portico vault. These adjustments suggest that these\nwindows were cut in the Haram wall after the portico had been\nbuilt (see above, p. 107).','SSA £240 RV AE\n\nIDENTIFICATION\n\nAbove the door, yet often unnoticed because of the gloom of\nthe vaulted street, the foundation inscription may still be found.\nMujir al-Din places what he calls the Duwaydariyya Madrasa at\nthe Gate of the Glory of the Prophets, and notes that part of the\nBasitiyya is built over it?

However, he\nalso tells us that he saw a copy of ‘Alam al-Din Sanjar’s waqfiyya,\nthe date of which was 7 Rabi‘ I 696/3 January 1297.\n\nThe discrepancy of a little over a year between the date of\nthe inscription and the reported date of the waqf document\ndoes not admit of a single confident explanation. One could\n claim that the inscription, which refers to what is manifestly a\nsummary of the endowment deed, must have been executed\nafter the date of that deed (696/1297). Why then was the\ninscription dated 695/1295?

But we have the literary\nevidence of Mujir al-Din*® that there is a certain Basitiyya\nMadrasa (no. 53) built in the ninth/fifteenth century ‘partly\nover’ (ba‘duba ald) the Dawadariyya. Certain features of the\nfacade confirm Mujir al-Din’s statement. Three in particular,\nthe muqarnas decoration of the voussoirs of the doorway\narch,” the small twin window with a circular window above®®\nand the billet moulding,” were not introduced to Jerusalem\nuntil the ninth/fifteenth century. Consequently the upper floor,\nover the portico, should be considered as belonging not to the\nkhangah butto the Basitiyya Madrasa (see below, pp.519-525).\n\nThe frontage of the khanq&h itself is obscured by the\nHaram portico“ and is devoid of pretension, being punctuated\nonly by five rectangular windows.*! The two westernmost\nwindows open in infill walls blocking two round-headed\narchways (plate 8.1) identical in form to the archway of the\npresent Bab al-‘Atm. All three archways were originally open,\nforming a triple gateway into the Haram, built probably in\nUmayyad times (see above, p. 45). The jambs of both windows\nare built partly of ablag masonry and the flat relieving arches\nabove the monolithic lintels are decorated with red ablaq\nvoussoirs identical to those of the relieving arches over the\nwindows in the north wall of the assembly hall (see below, p.\n162). Therefore we may assume that these two eastern bays of\nthe triple gateway were blocked up at the time of construction\nof the khanqah. The central window must be contemporaneous\n with the western ones. It is the same size as the western\nwindows and has similar ablag jambs but lacks their decorated\nrelieving arches. It may well take the place ofan earlier opening\nmade in the Haram wall before the construction of the portico,\nfor the vaulting of the adjacent bay of the portico is awkwardly\narranged in order to avoid blocking the window (fig. 8.3). The\ntwo eastern windows are quite plain. Their splayed embrasures\nin the Haram wall are skewed in order (a) to place the western\nwindow under the centre ofa portico vault (see fig. 8.3) and (b)\nto allow the eastern window to clear the springing of the\nadjacent portico vault. These adjustments suggest that these\nwindows were cut in the Haram wall after the portico had been\nbuilt (see above, p. 107).\n\nENTRANCE ( plate 8.2, fig. 8.4)\n\nThe magnificent entrance portal is set towards the centre of the\notherwise plain street facade (fig. 8.4). The portal recess is\nconstructed of red and cream-coloured ablag up to the level of\nthe springing of the vault. The masonry of the recess extends\nirregularly onto the facade (fig. 8.4, plate 8.2), the plain\nlimestone courses of which are generally deeper than the\n ablag courses of the portal. This shows that the portal has been\nbuilt into the adjoining masonry and may have been the last\npart of the facade to have been built, as was apparently\ncustomary Mamlik procedure.”\n\nThe entrance bay is 3.10m wide and 2.03m deep, with\nstone benches on either side, each framed by a quirked ogee\nmoulding (fig. 8.3). At the back is the entrance proper 1.55m\nwide and 2.45m high with a monolithic lintel and ablag joggled\nrelieving arch, the alternate voussoirs being of red stone.\n\nThe foundation inscription, above the relieving arch, runs\nacross the three sides of the bay and is continued at the right-\nhand side onto a lower course (plate 8.3). A circular\nmedallion® lightly carved with vegetal motifs is incorporated\nwithin the main band of inscription, over the door, and at the\nleft-hand end a semicircular escutcheon (plate 8.4) bears the\nmuallim’s ‘signature’.“* On the street facade two ornamental\ncarved stone roundels, each evidently intended to take a central\nboss, distinguish the extremities of the main inscription. There\nare somewhat similar unfinished-looking roundels in the side\nwalls at the level of the lower band of inscription (pate 8.3).\n\nThe vaulting of the portal recess (plate 8.5, fig. 8.4) is a\nveritable tour de force of the mw allim, ‘Ali b. Salama. Three\ntiers of muqarnas corbels, the lower two functioning as\npendentives, culminate in two monolithic fluted cupolas with\nmetal rings hanging from the apexes. Similar three-tiered\nmuqarnas imposts support the base of the vault on three sides\nwhile on the outer (street) side (fig. 8.4) the thrust of the vault\nis discharged through two pointed trefoil arches to the imposts,\nof which the central one, seemingly defying structural logic, is\nsuspended. From this suspended impost the thrust is first\ntransferred to the upper structure whence it is discharged\ndown through the lateral imposts (see fig. 8.8). In this system\nthere is a structural necessity to support the upper units\nmarked ‘a’ on the sketch (fig. 8.8) of the trefoil arches. This is\nachieved by the upward tapering of the suspended impost in a\nseries of inward overlaps up to the point where a small and\nalmost imperceptible outward joggle keys the impost into the\nlarge stone cantilevers (‘b’) which discharge the load. The tip of\nthe suspended impost is drilled, no doubt to permit a hanging\nlamp to heighten the dramatic effect of instability. The\nmu allim continues to perplex the observer by joggling the\nablag voussoirs of the enclosing pointed arch not in one plane\nbut two (plate 8.6). How this was done is unknown but since\nthe voussoirs are relatively simply joggled, with no re-entrant\nangles, it would have been possible to build up the arch from\neach side before sliding ina keystone whose joggling was cut at\nan acute angle to match the two adjoining voussoirs (fig. 8.9).\n\nThe system of vaulting adopted for the portal of the\nkhanqah was not original, however. In Damascus an\nevolutionary series of similar vaults survives. The prototype is\nthe Nuriyya Madrasa (567/1172),” followed by the ‘Adiliyya\n Madrasa (619/1222-23),‘° and the Qilijiyya Madrasa (651/1253-\n54)” which had four bays rather than two. The vaulting of the\nkhangah portal bears a striking resemblance to that of the\n‘AdiliyyainDamascus (fig. 8.10) andwascertainly inspired by ie\n\nIn all the Damascene examples a cornice moulding\ncrowns the facade, rising over the door to form a sort of\nrectangular pediment of a type that originated in the East and\nwhich is called pish-taq in Persian. The upper part of the facade\nof the Jerusalem khanqah is hidden behind a range of later\nyaults spanning the street, but there can be little doubt that a\nsimilar moulded cornice and pish-taq were used here also. The\nmoulded imposts for these later vaults are seventh/thirteenth\ncentury in scale and profile and are almost certainly re-used\nsections of the original cornice moulding of the khanqah. A\n 5.75m length of the same cyma moulding has been re-\nemployed over the recessed unit of three windows of the\nBasitiyya Madrasa (plate 53.1), possibly as part of the later\nrepairs to that building (see above, p. 156). There the moulding\nterminates at either end in a discontinuous down-turn: these\nmust be the very stones which formed the top corners of the\noriginal pish-taq of the khanqah.”\n\nINTERIOR (plan, fig. 8.3)\n\nThe entrance door leads directly into the courtyard where a\nmodern concrete wall has been erected to screen the interior\nfrom the view of passers-by.”” More modern is the jazzy dado\naround the walls of the courtyard, visible in plate 8.7; it was\npainted in the late 1970s. The same plate shows the fine original\npavement composed of big limestone slabs that remains largely\nintact.\n\nAt the south-west corner of the courtyard a niche (plate\n8.8) in the west wall houses a well-head where water could be\ndrawn from a cistern below. The sculptural detail of the\nmugarnas corbelling and relief-carved semidome covering the\nniche (plate 8.9) is encrusted with paint and_ virtually\nindecipherable.\n\nThe layout of cells round the courtyard is shown on the\nplan (fig. 8.3). Each cell has a typical Mamluk pointed-arched\ndoorway and is lit and ventilated by a high-level slit window\nplaced either directly over the door or to one side of it but\nalways immediately under the crown of the vault. In the east\nwall several of these windows and two doors have been\nsubsequently enlarged. Each of the two cells occupying the\nsouth-eastern corner of the khanqah has in addition a window\npenetrating the southern wall to overlook the Haram.\n\nMany of the partition walls between the cells in the north\nand east walls have been demolished to form larger rooms,\npossibly when the building was converted for use as a school\nsome time before 1914. A modern flight of steps in the south-\neast corner of the courtyard (plate 8.14) blocks the windows of\nthe adjacent cells and is probably part of the same conversion.\n Acornice moulding, similar in profile but smaller than the\ncornice moulding from the street facade, running round three\nsides of the courtyard defines the original height of the walls (it\nhas been replaced on the east side by a plain string course of a\ntype common in architecture of the nineteenth century in\nJerusalem).\n\nASSEMBLY HALL\nIn the western part of the southern wall of the courtyard, the\nimportant position of the assembly hall is expressed in a\nsymmetrical arrangement of three shallow recesses (plate\n8.10). The central recess, which contains the entrance door, has\na pointed horseshoe arch; the lateral recesses, containing\nrectangular windows, have pointed arches. The decoration of\nthe recess is obscured by several coats of paint but the main\nfeatures may still be observed. The jambs of the door and both\nwindows are constructed in ablaq, with alternate courses of red\nstone. The flat relieving arches over the windows are\ncomposed of distinctively joggled ablaq voussoirs, and incised\nsix-lobed rosettes decorate the tympanums. Over the door the\nablag voussoirs of the relieving arch are joggled with a profile\ndifferent from those over the windows. The oculus in the\ntympanum (now blocked) is surrounded by a circular\ncomposition of ablaq voussoirs within a moulded frame.\nThree steps lead up into the assembly hall, which is\nvaulted in three bays. Transverse arches divide the vaulting\nbays. The large south-facing window under the eastern bay\nopens under the Haram portico (above, p. 156). Under the\n western vaulting bay the semicircular arch of the easternmost\nbay of the Umayyad triple gate may be seen (plate 8.11). Adoor\nin the west wall of the assembly hall leads to a cross-vaulted\nchamber, the south wall of which is formed by the central bay\nof the triple gate. Both these bays of the triple gate are built up,\nsave for one window in each looking out on the Haram from\nunder the portico (above, p. 156). The sills of these windows\nare only 0.10m above the internal floor level but an average of\n1.74m above the floor level of the Haram portico (fig. 8.7)\n\nSTAIRCASE\nAt the north-east corner of the courtyard the door leading to the\nlobby and staircase is differentiated from the doors of the cells\nby its greater height and width and by its flat lintel surmounted\nby a relieving arch. The design of the staircase is illustrated in\nfig. 8.11. Plate 8.12 shows the system of half-arches supporting\nthe staircase, together with a high-level window which lights\nthe lobby, and the doors leading to the northern annexes. Since\nall the buildings at first floor level are of later construction, this\nstaircase, which was undoubtedly built as an integral part of the\nkhangah, originally led to the flat roofs of the khanqah and the\nadjoining Haram portico.\n NORTHERN ANNEXES\n\nThe large, irregularly shaped room entered through a door in\nthe east wall of the lobby in the north-east corner of the\ncourtyard is now so full of rubbish that a detailed examination\nhas not been possible. The plan shows that the north wall is\nconsiderably longer than the south wall and that, in order to\nfacilitate vaulting over this irregular space, corner abutments\nhave been introduced to reduce the span of the northern end\nof the cross vault. The upper part of a blocked doorway in the\nsouth wall is visible above the rubbish. The sill of the window\nin the east wall is barely one metre above floor level but almost\nthree metres above the level of the courtyard it overlooks.\n\nThe curious way in which the northern annexes project\nfrom an otherwise more or less regular quadrilateral layout on\nplan instantly suggests that here we have some part of a pre-\nMamluk construction which was taken over by the builders of\nthe khanqah. Furthermore, the fine ashlar masonry of much of\nthe structure, the pointed arches of the east and west side\nrecesses (a later, Ottoman fireplace has been built in front of\nthe west recess), and the deep cavetto moulding running round\nthe upper walls of the yard to form a cornice (visible in plate\n8.13), are of pre-Mamliik — Crusader or Ayyubid — type.\n\nThe plan (fig. 8.3) shows that the north — south axis of the\nnorthern annexes lies at right angles both to the northern\nboundary wall of the khanqah and to the south side of the street\ncalled Tariq al-Mujahidin. In other words, the north wall of the\nkhangah runs parallel to the south side of the street, not parallel\nto the north wall of the Haram.\n\nThe surface dressing of the coursed ashlar masonry of the\nsouth side of Tariq al-Mujahidin is at this point typically\nCrusader; the series of masons’ marks to be seen on several\nstones that appear to be in their original setting is good\nevidence of Crusader construction. The eastern extent of the\nCrusader wall is given by the vertical joint marked ‘V’ on the\nplan and visible in plate 37.3. The high vaulted passageway\n(shown in cross-section on fig. 8.6) which isolates the tunnel-\nvaulted gallery of the northern annexes from the street is\npanes with the Crusader street wall (below, p.\n301).\n\nThus we have the north and south sides of a rectangular\nstructure, and the position of the east side. One side is of\nCrusader construction, the other two almost certainly so. The\nfact that the fourth side belongs to the Mamlak Sallamiyya\nMadrasa (no. 25, built c. 738/1338) which now occupies most of\nthe area between the khanqah and the street need not concern\nus here, for the unavoidable inference is that, in 695/1295 at\nleast, the north and south walls and the eastern vaults of some\n unidentified Crusader building occupied the site immediately\nto the north of the khanqah, thereby determining the northern\nboundary of the khanqah. The southern boundary was\ndetermined by the north wall of the Haram, and the western\nboundary by the need to leave space for the street leading to the\nwestern bay of the Umayyad triple gate into the Haram.\n\nSo the irregular plan of the Dawadariyya Khanqah is no\naccident but the direct result of building within the confines of\na gap site. Indeed, the increasing thickness from west to east of\nthe north wall of the assembly hall is a conscious attempt on the\npart of the builders to disguise the irregularity by allowing the\nsouthern face of the wall to follow the alignment of the Haram\nwall and by adjusting the northern face of the wall to suit the\nalignment of the northern boundary.’ The appropriation of\nthe northern annexes was inevitable once the only means of\naccess to them was through the khangah.\n Aye\n\n1 Bab al-‘Atm was in Mamluk times referred to first as Bab Sharaf al-Anbiya’ and\nlater, after the construction of the Dawadariyya, as Bab Duwaydariyya (cf. CIA\n(Ville), 216 n. 2). the name changed to Bab al-‘Atm, ‘the Gate of Darkness’,\npresumably after the street was covered with vaults, obscuring the light, in the\nOttoman period. Today it is referred to also as Bab al-Malik Faysal since it was\nthrough this gate that King Faysal of Iraq entered the Haram during his visit in\n1930, as an inscription on the eastern pier commemorates.\n\n2 Mujir, ii, 39 & 112.\n\n3 Al-Umari, Masdlik, 158.\n\n4 CIA (Ville), 213-5, no. 70.\n\n5 For biography, see W4/i, xv, 479-482; Manhal, Cairo Ms. Ta’rikb 1113, ii, fols.\n128a — 129a (Cf.

In Jerusalem one other\nexample of such a technique is known to us: over the well-niche in the\n‘Uthmaniyya Madrasa (840/1437), see plate 57.10. A somewhat similar form of\ndecoration on the portal of the Jami‘ al-Utrush (811/1409) at Aleppo (CIA (Alep),\npl. clvii) appears to derive from the analogous decoration on the seventh/\nthirteenth-century Saljiiq Hans in Anatolia (see, e.g., D. Hilland O. Grabar, Islamic\nArchitecture and its Decoration, London 1967, pls. 349, 429, 469, 489, 490).\n\n38 Groups of windows arranged thus were very common in Mamlak Egypt and\nCreswell has proposed a Sicilian origin for them (MAE, ii, 201). There are, besides\n this example, only two others in Jerusalem: in the courtyard of the Hasaniyya\nMadrasa (837/1434) and above the entrance to the Sallamiyya Madrasa (see p.\n303). The Basitiyya example is the earliest (c. 834/1431) in Jerusalem.\n\n39 The first directly dated examples of this moulding in Jerusalem are at: Well of\nIbrahim al-Rami (839/1435-36): the ‘Uthmaniyya Madrasa (840/1437) and the\nJawhariyya Madrasa (844/1440). Given this close sequence of occurrences we\nshould be justified in considering the example at the Basitiyya Madrasa (waqf 834/\n\n1431) as the earliest.\n40 The portico is now blocked up with concrete partition walls. Plate 53.1 shows\n\nthe portico as it was in 1920.\n\n41 Al‘Umari (Masalik, 158) only counted the three largest (westernmost)\nwindows of ‘the Ribat of al-‘Alami al-Dawadari’ when enumerating the features of\nthe north wall of the Haram.\n\n42 Baybars al-Jashankir, for instance, began construction of his khangah/\nmausoleum in Cairo in 706/1306. First he built the mausoleum, then the khanqah\nunit in 707/1307, and the facade was added when he became sultan in 708/1308-9\nand completed in 709/1310, see: al-Maqrizi, Khitat, ti, 416-17; Creswell, Brief\nChronology, 86; CIA (Egypt), i, 164-65.\n\n43, CIA (Planches), liii B.\n\n44 Ibid., liii E.\n\n45 K.

In fact van Berchem explains that he was unable to photograph the\ndoorway because of the poor light but he does devote ten pages to the building\nand its inscription.\n\n48 Van Berchem (CIA (Ville), 220 n.3) remarks that the khangah in Jerusalem was\n(in 1914) known locally as the ‘Adiliyya although no-one was able to explain the\nreason for this appellation. Van Berchem speculates that it may have been due to\nthe founder’s post as Intendant of the Palace of Justice (Dar al-‘Adl),\n\n49 Altogether 15.5 metres of the moulding are still identifiable, including the\nimposts on both sides of the street and the section over the Basitiyya. The length\nof the street facade of the khanqah, from Bab al-‘Atm at the south to the Sallamiyya\nMadrasa at the north, is 21.75m.\n\n50 This is one of the few examples in Jerusalem of the Syrian (i.e. Damascene and\nAleppan) penchant for direct entrances into religious buildings. The usual\nJerusalem practice was to have a bent entrance, presumably for privacy.\n\n51 The same technique was carried to extremes by the Cairene builders of urban\ntombs.

Mujir al-Din remarks that this minaret,\nlike others around the Haram, appears to have been built on\nthe foundations of an earlier minaret that existed at the\ntime of ‘Abd al-Malik (65-86/685-705).1 There is now no visible\ntrace of an earlier minaret.\n\nThe present minaret, built entirely of stone except for a\ntimber canopy over the muezzin’s gallery, is of the traditional\nSyrian tower type, square in plan.” Externally it is divided by\nmouldings into several ‘storeys’. The two lowest storeys form a\nbase on which the upper storeys are set back to leave a\ncorbelled gallery above the base. At the sixth storey a bigger set-\nback gives a muezzin’s gallery, which is partly supported on\nmugarnas corbelling. This gallery has a modern balustrade\nand canopy. Above that is a lantern, octagonal in plan,\nsurmounted by a circular drum and bulbous dome.\n\nAn external staircase rises to a door in the east face of the\nsecond storey. This door leads to a passage along the north side\nof the minaret, from where another door opens to an internal\nspiral staircase up to the muezzin’s gallery.\n IDENTIFICATION\nAl-‘Umari, writing c.745/1345, describes at the end of the north\nwall of the Haram:\n\n... avery long staircase, which is new and from the top of\nwhich a minaret is reached as well as a house there\nbelonging to the Bani Jama‘a. This minaret is at the farthest\npoint of the west wall of the Haram. It is 53 dhira’\n(approximately 37.1m) high. At its top are carved wooden\nrailings. It is decorated with thirty-one fine marble\ncolumns.’\n\nBy Mujir al-Din’s time it had become known as the Ghawanima\nMinaret ‘because it is next to Bab al-Ghawanima.” That gate was\nso called after the Ghanim family, descendants of Shaykh\nGhanim b. ‘Ali b. Husayn, who was appointed shaykh of the\nSalahiyya Madrasa by Saladin.>\n\nDATE\nMujir al-Din relates that two porticoes (no longer extant)\nbelow the Governor’s House (the former Jawiliyya, no. 14)\n were constructed at the same time as the Ghawanima Minaret.\nThese porticoes bore an inscription giving the date of their\nconstruction and that of the minaret, but over the years it had\nbecome badly eroded (making it illegible).° He goes on to\nobserve that this minaret, the largest and most solid one, was\nbuilt by Qadi Sharaf al-Din ‘Abd al-Rahman, superintendent of\npious endowments in the Harams of Mecca and Medina and\nalso the Harams of Jerusalem and Hebron. Mujir al-Din saw a\ndocument confirming this qadi’s reappointment to these posts\nby Sultan Lajin. This document was dated 23 Jumada II 697/8\nApril 1298 and, he continues, the construction of the minaret\nmay be attributed to that time.’ He adds that he had been told\nthat the minaret was built in the reign of the descendants of\nQalawin and that that too is possible. In any case, a date of\nconstruction around 697/1298 accords well enough with the\narchitecture.\n\nSUBSEQUENT HISTORY\n\nAn inscription over the entrance door records that the minaret\nwas repaired by the Supreme Muslim Council in 1341/1922-23.\nThese repairs appear to have been of a minor nature, involving\nmainly the replacement of the balustrade and canopy of the\nmuezzin’s gallery.\n ','DATE, SUBSEQUENT HISTORY'),(11,'In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate.

He writes that ‘the north portico [of the Haram] stretches\neast to west from the Gate of the Tribes (Bab al-Asbat) to the\nJawiliyya Madrasa’.! All the institutions along the north wall of\nthe Haram are treated by him in a methodical manner. The\nargument that can be made to identify the Jawiliyya with the first\nfoundation met with as one moves eastwards from the\nGhawanima Minaret has been fully elaborated by van\nBerchem.’ There is also the argument from the fact that the\nJawiliyya was converted, as we shall see, into the seat of the local\ngovernor. While functioning as such, the building was visited,\nand its position made relatively clear, by a series of travellers\ndown to modern times. Al-‘Umari is our earliest source: ‘At the\n highest point of the wall [the Antonia escarpment] there are five\nwindows of the madrasa of the Amir Sanjar al-Jawili (may God\nhave mercy on him). The madrasa has no direct access to the\nHaram.” He also describes the long stairs to the minaret [the\nGhawanima Minaret] which gave access to a house belonging to\na member of the Bani Jama‘a family. That house was sold in\n952/1545 by a widow of a late member of the same family to\nSinan Bey, the governor of the Sanjak of Jerusalem, for 150\nCypriot gold coins.‘ The house stretched from the Haram\nfrontage to the street leading east to the Gate of the Tribes or St.\nStephen’s Gate, but its east boundary was the tomb chamber of\nIbn Darbas, a Hakkari Kurdish shaykh who died perhaps in the\nearly thirteenth century, and the lane leading to it. For our\npurposes we note that the tomb of Darbas was described as\nadjacent to the Jawiliyya Madrasa.°','He was born in 653/1255-56 at Amid (Diyarbakr).? Acceptance\nof this date attributes to him impressive longevity, but Ibn Hajar\nconfirms that he was nearly a hundred when he died. His full\nname was ‘Alam al-Din Abt Sa‘id Sanjar b. ‘Abdallah. Whether\n‘Abdallah was the real name of his father or the conventional\nattribution for a mamlik is not clear. It is recorded that his\n father was known as ‘the commissioner’ (al-mushidd), which\nmay indicate a career under an Islamic régime. Ibn\nTaghribirdi’® guesses that Sanjar may have been a Kurd on the\nbasis of his Shafi\'i affiliation. His birth-place may also support\nthat opinion. An amir called Jawil (Chavl1), one of Baybars I’s mamliks,\nwas Sanjar’s first master and the person from whom he derived\nhis nésba. After Jawil’s death Sanjar was transferred to Qalawiin,\nwas sent in the reign of al-Ashraf Khalil to Kerak, and then\nserved Sultan Kitbugha. His first office, which he exercised\nwithout an amirate, was the governorship of Shawbak. At the\nend of the thirteenth century he was acting as deputy Major-\nDomo for Baybars the Taster (later to be Baybars ID), while the\nlatter and the Amir Salar were together running the state.

As\nthe rivalry of the two great amirs increased, Sanjar and his\nalleged peculations became an issue between them. Salar’s\nfriendship and support could not prevent Sanjar’s being sent\naway in 706/1307 as battal to Damascus, where he was given a\ntablkhanah amirate. When al-Nasir Muhammad was preparing his second\nrestoration to power and came to Damascus from Kerak in\nSha‘ban 709/January 1310, Sanjar was among the amirs who\npledged their allegiance. Al-Nasir used Sanjar to persuade Salar\nto submit, a move which led to the latter’s imprisonment and\ndeath in the citadel in 710/1311. Sanjar and Salar had each\nappointed the other as executor and guardian of the other’s\nchildren. They had built a joint madrasa near the Mosque of Ibn\nTultin with adjacent tomb chambers. Now Sanjar laid his friend\nto rest in one of them. A year later al-Nasir sent Sanjar to be\ngovernor of Gaza!* where he remained until late 720/1320.

Military barracks remained, until the\nfoundation of the present school, which now occupies the\nJawiliyya compound. .\n ','IDENTIFICATION\n\nNo precise topographical information is to be found in Mujir al-\nDin. He writes that ‘the north portico [of the Haram] stretches\neast to west from the Gate of the Tribes (Bab al-Asbat) to the\nJawiliyya Madrasa’.! All the institutions along the north wall of\nthe Haram are treated by him in a methodical manner. The\nargument that can be made to identify the Jawiliyya with the first\nfoundation met with as one moves eastwards from the\nGhawanima Minaret has been fully elaborated by van\nBerchem.’ There is also the argument from the fact that the\nJawiliyya was converted, as we shall see, into the seat of the local\ngovernor. While functioning as such, the building was visited,\nand its position made relatively clear, by a series of travellers\ndown to modern times. Al-‘Umari is our earliest source: ‘At the\n highest point of the wall [the Antonia escarpment] there are five\nwindows of the madrasa of the Amir Sanjar al-Jawili (may God\nhave mercy on him). The madrasa has no direct access to the\nHaram.” He also describes the long stairs to the minaret [the\nGhawanima Minaret] which gave access to a house belonging to\na member of the Bani Jama‘a family. That house was sold in\n952/1545 by a widow of a late member of the same family to\nSinan Bey, the governor of the Sanjak of Jerusalem, for 150\nCypriot gold coins.‘ The house stretched from the Haram\nfrontage to the street leading east to the Gate of the Tribes or St.\nStephen’s Gate, but its east boundary was the tomb chamber of\nIbn Darbas, a Hakkari Kurdish shaykh who died perhaps in the\nearly thirteenth century, and the lane leading to it. For our\npurposes we note that the tomb of Darbas was described as\nadjacent to the Jawiliyya Madrasa.°\n\nDATE\n\nAs to the date of the construction or of the endowment, Mujir\nal-Din’s text is again silent. We know of only one text other than\nthose of al-‘Umari and Mujir al-Din, which mentions Sanjar al-\nJawili as the founder of an institution in Jerusalem. That is the\nchronicle of Ibn al-Dawadari, which mentions ‘a mosque\n(jami’) built by the Amir ‘Alam all Din Sanjar al-Jawili, when he\nwas governor of Gaza’.° His building elsewhere is well\nrecorded, not least by inscriptions in Hebron and Gaza. They\ndate from his period as governor of Gaza, when he also had\nresponsibility for Jerusalem and Hebron and held the post of\nSuperintendent of the Two Harams’ (compare the case of Faris\nal-Din Ilbaki, p. 337). Sanjar’s building in Jerusalem dates from\nthe same period, that is to say, 711-20/1311-20. For the\nfollowing eight years or so he was imprisoned in Alexandria or\nin the citadel in Cairo. Ibn al-Dawadari cannot have intended\nthe other short period of three months in 743/late 1342 during\nwhich Sanjar was governor of Gaza for the second time, since\nhis record of events finishes early in 735/autumn 1334 with just\na slight extension into the following year.®\n\nFOUNDER\n\nHe was born in 653/1255-56 at Amid (Diyarbakr).? Acceptance\nof this date attributes to him impressive longevity, but Ibn Hajar\nconfirms that he was nearly a hundred when he died. His full\nname was ‘Alam al-Din Abt Sa‘id Sanjar b. ‘Abdallah. Whether\n‘Abdallah was the real name of his father or the conventional\nattribution for a mamlik is not clear. It is recorded that his\n father was known as ‘the commissioner’ (al-mushidd), which\nmay indicate a career under an Islamic régime. Ibn\nTaghribirdi’® guesses that Sanjar may have been a Kurd on the\nbasis of his Shafi\'i affiliation. His birth-place may also support\nthat opinion.\n\nAn amir called Jawil (Chavl1), one of Baybars I’s mamliks,\nwas Sanjar’s first master and the person from whom he derived\nhis nésba. After Jawil’s death Sanjar was transferred to Qalawiin,\nwas sent in the reign of al-Ashraf Khalil to Kerak, and then\nserved Sultan Kitbugha. His first office, which he exercised\nwithout an amirate, was the governorship of Shawbak. At the\nend of the thirteenth century he was acting as deputy Major-\nDomo for Baybars the Taster (later to be Baybars ID), while the\nlatter and the Amir Salar were together running the state. Sanjar\nwas made an amir in early 698/late 1298, and became close to\nthe Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad through personal service.!! As\nthe rivalry of the two great amirs increased, Sanjar and his\nalleged peculations became an issue between them.

The power and\ninfluence he wielded were very great, yet his recent convert\nstatus made him vulnerable in the sometimes bitter religious\natmosphere of the period. He was involved in the scandal of the\nuse of mosque lamps in a church (in 714/1314-15), and was\naccused of protecting Christians during the terrible fires of 721/\n1321, when rumours of arson were rife and Christian fanatics\nadmitted their part in spreading the blaze in revenge for recent\npopular excesses against churches.

Two\nwaqf properties in Jerusalem, mentioned as boundaries for\nother properties, are all that have been met with in the sijills.\nThey are a vaulted chamber (gabw) in the al-Tabbaba (?)\ndistrict and a blacksmith’s shop in David\'s Quarter.”','There is some doubt, purely on the basis of the literary\nevidence involved, whether it has been correct to hold that an\nassembly hall (majma‘) of the Karimiyya was built at the same\ntime as the Ghadiriyya Madrasa, a little to the east, in 836/1432-\n33.” The assumption has been that the majma‘ replaced the\n parts of the Karimiyya described by al-‘Umari”! at ground-floor\nlevel under the portico. This has all been based on a passage in\nMujir al-Din” in which he dealt with the history of the north\nportico of the Haram. He had no firm evidence for the section\nfrom the Gate of the Tribes to the Ghadiriyya but held that\n‘circumstances indicated’ that it was built at the same time as the\nminaret, that is, in 769/1367-68. He then continued, ‘The\nportico below the Ghadiriyya was built with it [i.e. at the same\ntime as the Ghadiriyya], and similarly the majma‘ of the\nKarimiyya.’ It seems out of context for the author here to be\ngiving the date of the majma‘ relative to the Ghadiriyya. The\npassage concerns the dating of the various sections of the\nportico, each of which Mujir al-Din believed, as it seems, to\ncorrespond in date to the building above it. It is possible that\nMujir al-Din meant ‘. . . and similarly the majma‘ of the\nKarimiyya, [the portico below it was also built at the same time\nas it was]. It must be said that this is not an argument for the\ntruth of Mujir al-Din’s statement, but only for what he may\nreasonably be understood to have intended. Whatever the truth\nof the chronology —and, in fact, we may see from al-‘Umari that\nit is probably incorrect, because the latter’s text assumes the\nexistence of the portico before the madrasa’s construction —\nMujir al-Din could be pointing to an original majma ‘above the\nportico, quite independent of the arrangement in the portico\nitself. Much, if not most, of the original structure has been lost.\nThe concern here is merely to point out the ambiguity of the\nwording in Mujir al-Din’s text. Later references to the Karimiyya are not very numerous.\nThere is none in the Haram documents, and those in the\nJerusalem sijills already alluded to are negligible.\n It has been claimed” that Abii ‘Abdallah Muhammad al-\nGharnati, whom Ibn Battita met in Jerusalem in 726/1326, was\n‘shaykh of the Karimiyya Khanqah’, and the use of that term has\ncaused some discussion. What the text says, however, is ‘shaykh\nof the noble khanqah (shaykb al-khanqab al-karimay. The\nreference is not clear, but it would make sense if it were to a\nMaliki institution, and it is known that a zawiya did exist in the\nMoroccans’ Quarter along with the Afdaliyya Madrasa, where al-\nGharnati was teaching.”’\n The scholarly personnel known to have held positions in\nthe Karimiyya in the Mamlik period were members of the\nQalqashandi family and hence of Shafi‘ite allegiance.”° In the\nOttoman period the sijills indicate that the officials of the\nKarimiyya were provided by the Jarallah family, who were\nHanafis. The mere naming of those who held the posts of\nshaykh or mudarris, or some fraction thereof, does not really\njustify the claim that the Karimiyya functioned actively for five\ncenturies.

He had no firm evidence for the section\nfrom the Gate of the Tribes to the Ghadiriyya but held that\n‘circumstances indicated’ that it was built at the same time as the\nminaret, that is, in 769/1367-68. He then continued, ‘The\nportico below the Ghadiriyya was built with it [i.e. at the same\ntime as the Ghadiriyya], and similarly the majma‘ of the\nKarimiyya.’ It seems out of context for the author here to be\ngiving the date of the majma‘ relative to the Ghadiriyya. The\npassage concerns the dating of the various sections of the\nportico, each of which Mujir al-Din believed, as it seems, to\ncorrespond in date to the building above it. It is possible that\nMujir al-Din meant ‘. . . and similarly the majma‘ of the\nKarimiyya, [the portico below it was also built at the same time\nas it was]. It must be said that this is not an argument for the\ntruth of Mujir al-Din’s statement, but only for what he may\nreasonably be understood to have intended. Whatever the truth\nof the chronology —and, in fact, we may see from al-‘Umari that\nit is probably incorrect, because the latter’s text assumes the\nexistence of the portico before the madrasa’s construction —\nMujir al-Din could be pointing to an original majma ‘above the\nportico, quite independent of the arrangement in the portico\nitself. Much, if not most, of the original structure has been lost.\nThe concern here is merely to point out the ambiguity of the\nwording in Mujir al-Din’s text.\n\nLater references to the Karimiyya are not very numerous.\nThere is none in the Haram documents, and those in the\nJerusalem sijills already alluded to are negligible.\n It has been claimed” that Abii ‘Abdallah Muhammad al-\nGharnati, whom Ibn Battita met in Jerusalem in 726/1326, was\n‘shaykh of the Karimiyya Khanqah’, and the use of that term has\ncaused some discussion. What the text says, however, is ‘shaykh\nof the noble khanqah (shaykb al-khanqab al-karimay. The\nreference is not clear, but it would make sense if it were to a\nMaliki institution, and it is known that a zawiya did exist in the\nMoroccans’ Quarter along with the Afdaliyya Madrasa, where al-\nGharnati was teaching.”’\n The scholarly personnel known to have held positions in\nthe Karimiyya in the Mamlik period were members of the\nQalqashandi family and hence of Shafi‘ite allegiance.”° In the\nOttoman period the sijills indicate that the officials of the\nKarimiyya were provided by the Jarallah family, who were\nHanafis. The mere naming of those who held the posts of\nshaykh or mudarris, or some fraction thereof, does not really\njustify the claim that the Karimiyya functioned actively for five\ncenturies. The Jarallah family is resident in the building down\nto the present day.””\n ','IDENTIFICATION, DATE, FOUNDER, ENDOWMENT, SUBSEQUENT HISTORY'),(17,'','','','','Two inscriptions on the south face of the colonnade, one on a\nmarble slab above the middle arch and one on two marble\nslabs in the spandrels, record that:\n\n. the pavement (baldat) of the Haram al-Sharif was\n\ncompleted (takammala) and these arches (qanditir) were\nbuilt during the reign of . . .

It is true, however, that\nonly one third of the village of ‘Ayn Qinya is now recorded as\nwaqf for the madrasa and the ribat (the annual rent being 2000\naspers).

The copyist has unfortunately left\nout some sections of the text by mistake. The wagfiyya\ndescribes not only the madrasa of Tankiz but also two baths !”\nand the ablutions place (tabara) near them, all of which Tankiz\nbuilt and endowed. It is significant that there is no mention of\na Koran school, even though al-‘Umari associates one with\nTankiz’s charitable works and the madrasa in particular (bi-\nhadratiba).\"®\n\n(i) Description of the Building\n\nThe ground floor is described as a madrasa. One enters\nthrough double doors of walnut, brass plated. The porch is\nbuilt in white, yellow and black dressed stone with a gilded\ninscription band, bearing the name of the founder. Within\nthere are four vaulted halls (zwvdms), of which the southern is\ndedicated as a mosque (masjid) for public use.!? Owing to a\nvery glaring lacuna in the text, the eastern iwdn is the only\nother one mentioned, with its two grille windows, opening on\nto the Haram and with their shutters inlayed with ivory and\nebony.\n\nThe madrasa has a dado of coloured marble and the floor\nis paved with the same material. The central octagonal pool, fed\nfrom the conduit from ‘Arab, is mentioned, as is a kitchen, but\nwith no location specified for the latter. Beneath the south wall\nare ‘Roman vaults’, previously known as ‘The Templars’\nStables’, access to which is by a private door in the Moroccans’\nQuarter. Below the eastern wall is ‘a Solomonic vault’, which\nthe founder Tankiz had. restored. The latter now contains a\ncistern with pipes by which the rain water is collected from the\nmadrasa roof. The length of the cistern is 45 [Hashimi] cubits”\nand the breadth 17. The water is drawn through a grille (taqa)\nin a structure (bayt) built by the founder next to his ribat for\nwomen (see below). Within the structure is a stone basin\n(jurn), the dimensions of which are 3 by 2 [Hashimi] cubits. To\nthe north of the vault was situated the Water-wheel Garden\nenclosure (Hakiirat al-Siqdya), the site of the later Baladiyya, it\nseems. The site was bounded to the west by other ‘ruined vaults\n(agqba’y.\n\nThe madrasa is said to contain 22 rooms, 11 on the ground\nfloor for the Hanafi lawyers and 11 above for the Sifis. The\neleven rooms on the ground floor seem to include one for the\nbawwab. All the rooms are vaulted and may be closed off by\ntheir own door.\n\nAbove the main porch is a set of rooms (tabaqa), roofed in\nwood and with two grilled windows looking north. Above two\nof the upper floor rooms (the text is no more explicit than that)\nthere is a fabaqa, again roofed in wood, with windows looking\nsouth. Access is via a staircase within the madrasa, and as for\nuse, they are to lodge whomsoever the administrator choses to\nplace there.\n\nThe range of buildings over the Haram portico which had\nbeen erected with the permission of the Qadi of Damascus, ‘Izz\nal-Din al-Muqaddisi al-Hanbali, is as follows.”’ The\nsouthernmost room, which is called the mosque (masjid) and\nis the place where the establishment of fifteen Stfis assemble\ndaily before dawn and after the evening prayer, has a wooden\nroof carved (manjiir ?) and decorated with gold and lapis\nlazuli, and walls clad in coloured marble. The mibrab in the\nsouthern wall, has similar marble and columns. The ‘mosque’\nhas several iron grille-windows, nearly all of which have\ndouble shutters, described as ‘painted Frankish’ ones (madhbun\nifranji).” There were two in the south wall and three in the east\n(these all overlooking the Haram) and three others in the west\nwall which was ‘built on the Haram wall’, and one more\nwindow giving on to the roof of the madrasa (sic). Double\ndoors in the north wall lead into an iwdn.\n\nThe iwdain is also roofed with wood, painted with gold and\nlapis lazuli, but the eastern half of the floor only is paved with\nmarble. Two arches built in black and white dressed stone rest\non three columns of white marble, and there is a white\n{marble?] balustrade (darabzin).\n From this one moves north through a private door (bab\nkbdss), decorated like the shutters above, into a chamber\n(majlis), roofed as before. This room has two iron grille\nwindows, with double shutters, in the eastern wall. Two doors\nwithin give access, one, to the tabaqa over the main porch, and\nthe other, to the roof of the madrasa.\n\n(ii) Endowment\n\nThe village of ‘Ayn Qinya” with all its lands, situated in the\nJerusalem district west of the village of Ramallah, is specified as\nthe endowment\'s chief source of income. It is also clear that the\ntwo baths were to provide rents for the madrasa and the other\nprovisions of the waqf, such as the ablutions place, and its\nmaintenance. The personnel and the administration of the\nmadrasa have been dealt with already in earlier pages (see pp.\n71-72). Their pay and allowances were as follows:\n Each Sufi (including the Shaykh) received a third of a rotl\nof olive oil and the same of soap each month. Any visiting Sufi\nwas given half a dirham and half a rotl of bread daily for a\nmaximum of ten days.\n\n(iti) Women’s Ribat\n\nThe wagqfiyya gives no extended description of the ribat. It\nmerely says that it is ‘in the vicinity of the madrasa (al-mujawir\nlil-madrasa) , and ‘built in stone with lime [mortar]’, and refers\nto the inmates having to assemble for prayers ‘in one of the two\niwans of the ribat’. Some later references show, however, that\nthe ribat formed no part of the main complex of the madrasa.\nIt was situated on the other side of the little square outside the\nChain Gate.\n\nAn interesting conveyance deed, dated 953/1547,”\' deals\nwith the purchase of the accommodation above the Chain Gate\nby a member of the Ibn Jama‘a family. The boundaries are\nspecified as follows: south — the wall of the Tankiziyya Madrasa\nand the part of the same provided as living quarters, east — the\n‘air’ of the Haram, north — the Ashrafiyya Madrasa and the upper\npart of the bawwdab’s house (bayt) in the Baladiyya turba, west\n—the ‘air’ of the Chain Gate market place and the roof (zahr) of\nthe Ribat al-Nisa’, the waqf of the Tankiziyya Madrasa. In 968/\n1560 the same purchaser rented a further narrow strip of the\nroof of the ribat. The east boundary is defined as ‘the portico\n(kharij) of the Bab al-Sakina, on which the house of the lessee\nstands.”\n\nThe general position of the ribat and the fact that it\nstretched some way westward are illustrated by a document\nconcerning the alienation of a house as waqf, dated 984/1576.\nThe document shows that the ribat of Tankiz formed not only\npart of the eastern, but also part of the northern boundary of the\n house that itself stood to the west of the Sa‘diyya Mausoleum.”°\n\nTankiz\'s waqfiyya set out the following pay and allowances\nfor the inmates of the ribat:\n Each visitor was entitled to “4 dirham and % of a rotl of\nbread daily for a maximum of 10 days.\n Each visitor was entitled to “4 dirham and % of a rotl of\nbread daily for a maximum of 10 days.\n\nSUBSEQUENT HISTORY\n\n(i) Mamltk period\n\nIn 733/1333, only a few years after the foundation, we hear ofan\n‘Ala’ al-Din b.

The lowest storey is largely concealed by later\nstructures (plates 20.1 and 20.2). Only the east side is relatively\nunencumbered in this way. It is quite plain apart from the\nrectangular entrance door (plate 20.3). The string course\ndividing this from the second storey is decorated with a cyma\nrecta moulding\n\nDirectly above the string course, slit windows with ogee\nheads pierce the masonry of the second storey in the middle of\nthe south, west and east sides to light the staircase. Above these\nwindows are two shallow circular recesses, matched by a\nsimilar recess in the north side. The west side is plain. If these\ncircular recesses were intended to contain some applied\nornament, no trace of such survives. Perhaps more likely is that\nthey were intended simply to relieve an otherwise blank panel\nof masonry on those sides of the minaret that are visible from\nwithin the Haram. A cavetto string course embellished with a\nrepeating mugarnas motif divides this storey from the third.\n\nThe third storey is more elaborately decorated with\nrecesses in each side containing round-headed slit windows.\nEach of these recesses is spanned by three tiers of muqarnas\ncorbelling, five units wide on the north and south sides, and\nthree units wide on the east and west sides. Nook-shafts\ncomposed of re-used Crusader columns with capitals and bases\noccupy the lower part of the jambs of each recess.\n\nThe fourth storey comprises a square chamber containing\nthe stairhead of the minaret within a corbelled muezzin’s\ngallery. This has a modern balustrade and canopy. Immediately\nbelow the corbelling supporting the muezzin’s gallery traces\nsurvive of a cavetto string course embellished with a repeated\nmugarnas motif. Much of this string course has been replaced\nwith a plain string course (see plate 20.4), presumably when\nthe top of the minaret was repaired following the earthquake\nmentioned in the sequel to Mujir al-Din’s chronicle (see\nabove). Since most of the original string course has been\nreplaced, it follows that the corbelling above has been rebuilt\nor replaced also. The present composite corbels supporting\nthe gallery, five on each side and one at each corner, are\nassembled in a somewhat makeshift fashion as if they are in\nsecondary use.\n\nThe muezzin’s stair emerges by a door in the south side of\nthe stairhead chamber, above which is an octagonal lantern\nsurmounted by a circular drum and bulbous stone dome now\n sheathed in lead and fitted with a crescent finial. The whole of\nthis uppermost part of the minaret has been rebuilt, as\nevidenced by the texts cited above and by the ogee head of the\nstaircase door, which is late Mamlik or Ottoman in style and\nprobably dates from the repairs mentioned above. The\narrangement of a square chamber surrounded by a gallery and\nsurmounted by an octagonal lantern is similar to that found at\nthe Ghawanima Minaret (no. 10) and so may recall the original\narrangement. The circular drum and dome belong to the 1894\nrepairs, and were refurbished in 1922-23 (see above).\n\nINTERIOR (plans, figs. 20.2 and 20.3)\nThe minaret is now reached from the entrance staircase of the\nAshrafiyya (see below, p.598). How it was reached originally is\n not known. The present Ashrafiyya staircase, built in 887/1482,\nmay replace an earlier one, though if such Gasted al-‘Umari,\nwriting c.745/1345, makes no mention of it.’ Alternatively, a\nlittle staircase (now blocked) that rises from beside the tomb\nchamber of the Baladiyya (see below, pp. 447 and 598) might\nonce have served to give access to the minaret.\n\nA wide archway in the south side of the top landing of the\nAshrafiyya staircase opens into a barrel-vaulted passage in\nwhich a flight of eight steps rises eastwards to an open porch\nalong the east side of the minaret. This passage and the frontage\nof the porch, with one window opening north on the Ashrafiyya\nstaircase and two opening east on the Haram, were built at the\nsame time as the Ashrafiyya. A partition now blocks the\nsouthern end of the porch and partly masks the entrance to the\n minaret (plate 20.3). The plain entrance door leads to a stone\nspiral staircase within the core of the minaret, which rises to the\nmuezzin’s gallery. The ceiling of the staircase is formed by the\nsinderside of the stens above. dressed with plaster (plate 20.5).\n AVULES\n\n1 Mujir, 379.\n\n2 CIA (Haram), 123-27.\n\n3 Mujir, 379.\n\n4 L.A.

Al-‘Umari dealt with it in connection with\nthe south wall of the Haram, perhaps because the Fakhriyya had\na north facing door, whereas Mujir al-Din, more\nunderstandably, considered it to belong to the west wall. If you\nenter via the Moroccans’ Gate, ‘The first thing you meet with on\nthis [south] wall to the west is a mastaba, which, from the\nmibrab northwards, measures six dhira‘, and is six and a half\n wide... To the east of this comes the entrance to the Fakhriyya\nZawiya ...’ These are al-‘Umari’s words.” He also makes it clear\nthat the Fakhriyya occupied the space within the wall of the\nHaram to the west of the Moroccans’ Mosque. Mujir al-Din writes: ‘As for the madrasas adjacent to the\nwall of the Haram on the west side, which we shall mention in\norder, the first is the Fakhriyya Khanqah. It is next to the\nMoroccans’ Mosque, where the Malikis pray, to the west of it,\nand within the wall of the Haram, as is also its entrance, near the\ngate that leads out into the Moroccans’ Quarter.”','The building was built and endowed by his exalted\nExcellency the Qadi Fakhr al-Din Aba ‘Abdallah\nMuhammad b.

He was a\ngreat and honoured state official. He died in the middle of\nRajab 732 [12 April 1332], over seventy years of age. Fakhr al-Din was one of the great officials of al-Nasir\nMuhammad.’ His uncle was Sharaf al-Din b. Zunbir, another\nhigh official. Fakhr al-Din was a devout person in both the\nChristian and the Muslim phases of his life. When pressure was\nbeing brought on him to convert, he contemplated suicide\nuntil, after a period of retreat, he reconciled himself to the\nnecessity. He adopted the Hanafi school of law (madbhab), is\nSaid to have eschewed all contact with Christians and to have\ntaken his Islam seriously.

Al-‘Umari dealt with it in connection with\nthe south wall of the Haram, perhaps because the Fakhriyya had\na north facing door, whereas Mujir al-Din, more\nunderstandably, considered it to belong to the west wall. If you\nenter via the Moroccans’ Gate, ‘The first thing you meet with on\nthis [south] wall to the west is a mastaba, which, from the\nmibrab northwards, measures six dhira‘, and is six and a half\n wide... To the east of this comes the entrance to the Fakhriyya\nZawiya ...’ These are al-‘Umari’s words.” He also makes it clear\nthat the Fakhriyya occupied the space within the wall of the\nHaram to the west of the Moroccans’ Mosque.\n\nMujir al-Din writes: ‘As for the madrasas adjacent to the\nwall of the Haram on the west side, which we shall mention in\norder, the first is the Fakhriyya Khanqah. It is next to the\nMoroccans’ Mosque, where the Malikis pray, to the west of it,\nand within the wall of the Haram, as is also its entrance, near the\ngate that leads out into the Moroccans’ Quarter.”\n\nDATE\nThere is no foundation inscription and the date of the original\nwagdfiyya is not recorded. The founder died in Rajab 732/April\n1392:\n\nFakhr al-Din is known to have visited Jerusalem. A son of\nhis, who died in 714/1314, had taken over administrative\nresponsibilities ‘while his father was absent in Jerusalem’. In\n716/1316 he came to the city with the Chief Qadi Badr al-Din\nMuhammad b. Jama‘a, and came once more in 723/1323.4\nWhether it was during one of these visits that he began his\nbuilding we have no way of telling.\n\nFOUNDER\nThe continuation of Mujir al-Din’s text identifies the founder:\n\nThe building was built and endowed by his exalted\nExcellency the Qadi Fakhr al-Din Aba ‘Abdallah\nMuhammad b. Fadl Allah, the Inspector of the Army. He\nwas born a Copt, but converted and became a good\nMuslim. He made many waqfs and was charitable and\ngenerous towards the men of religious learning. He was a\ngreat and honoured state official. He died in the middle of\nRajab 732 [12 April 1332], over seventy years of age.\n\nFakhr al-Din was one of the great officials of al-Nasir\nMuhammad.’ His uncle was Sharaf al-Din b. Zunbir, another\nhigh official. Fakhr al-Din was a devout person in both the\nChristian and the Muslim phases of his life. When pressure was\nbeing brought on him to convert, he contemplated suicide\nuntil, after a period of retreat, he reconciled himself to the\nnecessity. He adopted the Hanafi school of law (madbhab), is\nSaid to have eschewed all contact with Christians and to have\ntaken his Islam seriously.\n\nHe began his administrative career as clerk of the\nmamliks and was transferred to the Army Bureau in Shawwal\n 709/March 1310, early in al-Nasir’s third and final reign.° He fell\nprey to the common internal rivalries and was dismissed for a\nmonth or so in 712/1312, during which time some 400,000\ndirhams were taken from him.

Apart from the fact that the\nterminological and functional distinction was never so exact, al-\n‘Umari refers to the building as the Fakhriyya Zawiya towards\nthe middle of the eighth/fourteenth century and Mujir al-Din\ncalls it a khanqah at the very beginning of the tenth/sixteenth\ncentury. Both Tahrir registers, which date from the second half\nof this latter century, head their entry ‘the waqf of the Fakhriyya\nKhanqah’, but then refer once to ‘the madrasa’. The Jerusalem\nsijills also alternate between ‘madrasa’ and ‘khangah’ when\ndealing with the Fakhriyya.\n\nMost of the sijill entries are connected with leasing the\nwadf lands. For example, in 962/1555 a qadi leased some of the\nQamra land from the overseer for fifty years for 1000 paras.’ In\n984/1576, a mugqata a contract, that is a farm ofall the revenues,\nfor a period of four years, was negotiated on payment of 120\ngold pieces (30 annually).’®\n\nTwo other entries deserve mention. An order was made in\n937/1530 to unblock a door leading to an ablutions place at the\nMoroccans’ Gate, over which the Fakhriyya was said to be\nconstructed. This gate had been illegally closed, because of the\nsmells the place occasioned, by the late Qadi ‘Abd al-Rahman\nMuhammad al-‘Ulaymi, who had resided in the madrasa.!? At\nthe end of 963/autumn 1556 certain repairs to the Fakhriyya\n were contracted for at the cost of 45 gold pieces to cover\nmaterials and labour. The details of the repairs are not easy to\nfollow but they mention a length of the western wall (17%\ncubits), the vaulting (aqd) of the ruined house adjoining that\nwall, the vaulting of ‘the cell, the old door of which has now\nbeen blocked and a new one opened’, the open court (saa) on\nthe west side, the vaulting of ‘the western cell which is\nalongside the house’, ‘the upper room which is in the top house\n(al-dar al-‘@liya), the cells of the madrasa and the passage\n(dibliz) of the ablutions place’.”°\n\nMembers of the Abi al-Su‘tid family lived in the Fakhriyya\nfor several centuries down to recent times. The buildings\nbecame their direct property. Asali has suggested that the year\n984/1576-77 was the beginning of their connection with the\nFakhriyya but, dating from their taking on the office of overseer,\nthe connection can be put back some twenty years.”\n ','IDENTIFICATION, DATE, FOUNDER, ENDOWMENT, OTTOMAN PERIOD'),(24,'The Sitiq al-Qattanin complex contains three inscriptions and\nan artisan’s ‘signature’.\'* Two of the foundation inscriptions are\nat the monumental east entrance, the so-called Bab al-Qattanin,\none on the east face of the lintel of the gateway and the other on\nbrass bands adorning the west face of the original wooden\ndoors.\'* The door leaves open towards the Haram, fitting\nflushly into lateral reveals, and so the inscription is visible when\nthe doors are open.

Abi Bakr al-\nMawsili!? endowed it with a third of the income from various\nlands. The other two thirds were to go to his descendants, or\nfailing that, to be divided into quarters and to be dispensed in\nequal portions to the ‘feast’ (simat) provided at the Haram at\nHebron, to the Mansiiri Hospice, the Hospital of Salah al-Din\nand the Great Sallamiyya Zawiya.’° A similar division of the\nincome of another two portions of agricultural land near\nJerusalem, a third to the Sallamiyya Madrasa and two thirds to\nhis offspring and descendants, was made by the same ‘Abd al-\nMalik. His grandson (?), Sadr al-Din b. Ahmad b. ‘Abd al-Malik\nal-Mawsili, endowed his offspring and descendants with a\nquarter of the village of Bira, which, if they died out, would\nbenefit equally a zawiya, founded by his ancestors in Damascus,\nand the Sallamiyya Madrasa.\n The first of these waqfs, the one dated 831/1427,\nenvisaged, as far as the Sallamiyya was concerned, the\nmaintenance of a Koran specialist (15 dirhams monthly) to\ninstruct six persons daily over a period of two years, in which\nthey would each receive 7/2 dirhams monthly. There was also\nto be a Hadith specialist to recite from the collection of Bukhari\nduring the months of Rajab, Sha‘ban and Ramadan each Muslim\nyear, who would receive 20 dirhams a month. Any excess was\nto be spent on ‘the Mosul Stfis who assemble to pray for the\nbenefactor (al-mujtamiin ala awrdd al-waqif)’.\n\nAsali has argued that the Sallamiyya in due course came to\nbe known as the Mawsiliyya.\'* Van Berchem mentioned that in\n1893 he had noted a popular name “Musliyya’. He questioned\nthe value of this information and asked whether it could be a\ncorruption of ‘Salamiyya’.” It is clear that it should be\nunderstood as a corruption of Mawsiliyya. The change could\nhave arisen to mark the importance of the supplementary\nendowments of the Mawsili family in the early fifteenth century,\nor it is possible that there was some built-in preference for\nSifis from the Mosul region (see the mention of Mosul Sufis in\nthe wagqfiyya of ‘Abd al-Malik, dated 831/1427). We may assume\nthat there was no intention to found an independent institution\nabove or behind the Sallamiyya since the waqf of 831/1427 was\nstated to be ‘for the good of the Great Sallamiyya Madrasa’. Also\none must note that no Mawsiliyya is recorded in Mujir al-Din,\neven though the second endowment of ‘Abd al-Malik al-Mawsili\nrefers to the Sallamiyya-Mawsiliyya Madrasa. At all events, the\ndate 831/1427 fits well with that predicated on stylistic grounds\nfor substantial rebuilding of the upper structures, namely the\ndecade c.830-40/1426-36.\"°\n\nIn view of the strong connection with the Mosul region it\nis odd that al-Sakhawi records that two members of a family of\nNorth African origin and of Maliki allegiance in law held the\npost of shaykh of the Sallamiyya in the fifteenth century. Khalifa\nb. Mas‘tid came in 784/1382-83 to settle in Jerusalem and\nbecome imam of the Moroccans’ Mosque in the Haram.\"” His\nson, Abt ‘Abdallah Muhammad (801-89/1399-1484),\'®\nsucceeded him in that post and was shaykh of the Siifis of the\nAbi Madyan Way (an order of Western Islamic origin) in\naddition to his headship of the Sallamiyya. In the latter post and\nas imam of the Moroccans’ Mosque he was followed by his son,\nanother Muhammad (851-97/1448-91).\'? Although Mujir al-Din\nmentions all three persons, he does not record any link with\nthe Sallamiyya.\n\nOTTOMAN PERIOD\n\nAs far as the nomenclature is concerned, the position is\ncomplicated. There exist within the Court records references\nto the ‘Sallamiyya Madrasa’ in 968/1561 andas late as 1027/1618.\nBoth entries concern the leasing of waqf property in Jerusalem,\na stable and a shop.” The only double naming, as in the\nwagfiyya abstract, concerns the appointment of a Zayn al-Din\n‘Umar to be shaykh and administrator of the Mawsiliyya-\nSallamiyya Madrasa (sic) in 982/1575.”\" All other entries, which\nrange in date from 947/1540 to 1093/1682, refer to the\nMawsiliyya simply, which in one case, in 1071/1661, is\ndescribed as the Mawsiliyya Khangab.”\n\nA schedule of repairs to the ‘Mawsiliyya’, dated 985/1578,”\nwhich were estimated to cost 4,774 paras, mentions ‘the cells\nadjoining the Basitiyya . . . three rooms (Aujarat) and three\napartments (buyzit)... the main residence (al-dar al-kabira)\n...and the cells in the lower madrasa (al-madrasa al-\ntabtaniyya). Does this last phrase relate to the original\nSallamiyya? By about two years later, 3,579 paras had been\nspent for work which began early 986/spring 1578.4 Further\nrepairs were authorised in 1008/1600 at an estimated cost of\n2,065 paras, when the cells (al-kbalawi) were mentioned.”\n\nThe lands of the ‘Mawsiliyya’ were farmed for the tax year\n985/1577-78 to a Jerusalem resident for 40 gold pieces. It is\nexpressly recorded’® that the income for both the madrasa and\nthe descendants of the benefactor was covered by this. The\nphraseology recalls the division of the income in the wagfiyyas\n of ‘Abd al-Malik al-Mawsili and proves the change of name\nconclusively, since the madrasa named originally in those\ndocuments was the Sallamiyya.””\n\nIn 1065/1655 the boundaries of a house made waqf for a\ndaughter by Ishaq al-Lutfi, a member of the family who in the\nfirst century or so of Ottoman rule held positions in the\ninstitution and then control of the waqf,* prove that the\nMawsiliyya then spanned the street to the north.” The house in\nquestion was clearly situated in the vaulting where the Bab al-\n‘Atm Street joins the main east — west Mujahidin Street. Its south\nboundary was a house in the vault over the side street,\ncompleted by a portion of the Mawsiliyya. The north boundary\nwas the tomb chamber of the Hanafiyya madrasa, that is the\nMu‘azzamiyya, and to the east was the Mawsiliyya with the street\nbelow it.\n NORTH FRONTAGE (plate 25.1)\n\nThe north frontage on to Tariq al-Mujahidin is of\nheterogeneous construction. The lower part, which forms the\nnorth boundary of the Sallamiyya, includes many stones with\ncharacteristic Crusader diagonal dressing and masons’ marks.\nThe consistency of the coursing, colour and texture of this\nmasonry suggests that these stones are not in secondary use; in\nother words, the wall is Crusader. The window design and the\nstone dressing indicate that the upper wall is entirely Ottoman\nor modern.\n\nTwo doorways which are integral features of the Crusader\nwall have been blocked.*° Above one of these, at the west end\nof this frontage, is a shallow pointed-arched recess with a\nsloping sill, which contains the northern window of the\nSallamiyya’s assembly hall (p/ate 25.1). The insertion of the\nrecess into the pre-existing wall has produced an awkward\nconjunction with the lintel of an older doorway below. The\nother blocked doorway is 23m to the east (see below, p. 305).\n\nIn the upper part of the Crusader wall may be seen four\nsmall windows which light a corridor behind the wall. Four\nspringings for vaults, which evidently spanned or were\nintended to span Tariq al-Mujahidin, survive at regular intervals\nin the two uppermost remaining courses of the western half of\nthe Crusader wall. There is nothing to correspond with these\nspringings on the opposite (northern) side of the street, which\nis formed partly by the south wall of the Ayyubid Mu‘azzamiyya\nMadrasa (614/1217-18), and so it may be inferred that either the\nvaulting over the street was demolished before the\nconstruction of the Mu‘azzamiyya or, alternatively, it was never\ncompleted.\n WEST FACADE (fig. 25.5)\n\nThe west facade on Tariq Bab al-‘Atm is the only external wall\nof Mamlik construction. Its northern part is somewhat\nobscured by later vaults spanning the street. The entrance\nportal and part of the wall south of it are unencumbered by\nlater vaults and stand at the only part of the street to remain\nopen to the sky. The most distinctive decorative features are\nconcentrated on this west facade and since we are obliged to\ndepend on stylistic analysis of these features to establish our\ndating criteria, they are worthy of special attention.\n\nThe facade is-divided into two unequal lengths of 13.72m\nand 3.44m respectively by the monumental portal unit, which\npresents a front of 5.97m including a frame moulding, and a\nheight of 7.80m to the original cornice. The total length of the\nfacade is therefore 23.13m. The short length to the right of the\nentrance is plain apart from two very small windows admitting\nlight to the staircase giving access to the roof. The other length,\nleft of the entrance, is relieved by three shallow recesses,\nevenly spaced, which contain grilled windows of the assembly\nhall. The head of the central recess has four tiers of angular\nmuqarnas corbelling while the two lateral recesses have three-\ntiered curvilinear muqarnas heads. The use of angular\nmuqarnas is significant: this is the only known occurrence in\nBahri Mamluk Jerusalem and, as we shall see, is a valuable clue\nin the dating process. The decoration below the mugqarnas\ncorbelling is similar in each case: the sills of the recesses slope\nat an angle of approximately 45°; the window jambs are of red\nand cream-coloured ablag; and above the plain monolithic\nlintels are panels of joggled ablaq revetment simulating flat\nrelieving arches.\n\nThe monumental entrance portal (plate 25.2) is framed by\na quirked ogee moulding (fig. 25.5) which extends inwards to\nframe stone benches on either side of the portal recess. The\ndeep recess (2.85m wide and 2.41m deep) is covered by a\nhorizontally developed mugarnas system with pendent\nelements, like a stalactite canopy (plate 25.3)2\" This distinctive\nstalactite canopy is the crucial element in the dating process\n(see below). Within the frame moulding up to the height of\nspringing of the stalactite canopy the portal is constructed in\nred and cream-coloured ablag. The canopy and the\nsurrounding stonework are constructed in the usual ‘malaki’\nlimestone, which has taken a beautiful amber tint. The\nstalactites are badly weathered now. Since no amount of\nstereotomical ingenuity could keep them naturally in place\nthey are tied back to the superstructure of the canopy by eight\n judiciously placed iron nails with wide heads. Even so, the\ncanopy has sagged in places and now sparrows nest in\ninterstices between the stones.\n\nThe recess is paved with a massive slab of limestone\nsurrounded by a black stone border. The entrance doorway,”\nwhich opens in the rear wall of the recess, is surmounted by a\nlintel fronted with pseudo-voussoirs of ablaq*? like the pseudo-\nrelieving arches over the windows. The outer face of this\nrevetment is set approximately four centimetres back from the\nsurrounding masonry within a narrow frame moulding. The\nlintel rests on, shoulders decorated with three tiers of\nmugarnas. A relieving arch, separated from the lintel by one\ncourse of red stonework, is functional in this case, albeit\nfronted with pseudo-voussoirs as well. Two square frames, one\nat either end of the relieving arch, enclose circular medallions\neach linked to its frame by four circlets inlaid with red-\ncoloured stone (fig. 25.6). The medallions are inscribed with\nthe Muslim confession of faith: ‘There is no God but Allah’ (in\nthe right-hand one) and ‘Muhammad is the Apostle of God’ (in\nthe left-hand one).*4 A sunken band, evidently intended for an\ninscription which has never been carved, runs round the portal\nrecess under the stalactite canopy and extends across the\nfrontage where it is closed at each end by pointed, bow-shaped\nansae with palmette terminals.\n\nThe original iron-plated double doors and heavy iron\nknockers are still in use (plate 25.4). Iron nails with lozenge\nshaped heads, arranged according to a hexagonal grid with\ngibbous ribbed-headed nails in the centres of the hexagons, fix\nthe horizontal iron bands to the timber frames. The iron bands\nare carried round the sides of the door leaves and nailed to the\ntimber stiles. Two wooden panels of geometric ornament are\nall that survive of the decoration of the inner faces of the doors\n(plate 25.5). The leaves turn on spindles located in the usual\nfashion in sockets in the paving behind the threshhold and in\nthe springers of a segmental arch behind the lintel.\n\nThe constructions over the entrance portal (shown in Sig.\n25.5) are difficult to assess. A vertical joint in the masonry above\nthe top right-hand corner of the portal is evidence of two\nphases of construction. This is confirmed by the colour and\ntexture of the masonry. The greyish stonework of the structure\ndirectly over the entrance portal is quite different from the\nmasonry of the lower facade, while at least the lower masonry\ncourses of the adjoining structure to the south appear to match\nthose of the facade below.\n\nThe southern structure incorporates the remains of a\n balcony (now partly obscured by the later vaults spanning the\nstreet) framed by a quirked ogee moulding and supported on\ncarved brackets, one of which is still visible (plate 25.6). The\nfact that the moulding framing the balcony is identical to the\none framing the portal is a good indication that the two are\ncontemporaneous. The interior of the room which opens onto\nthe balcony is square in plan and roofed with a shallow domical\nvault (plate 25.7), a feature generally associated with buildings\nof the Ottoman period in Jerusalem, but the vault might have\nbeen rebuilt. Indeed, some remodelling must have been done\nwhen the balcony was encroached upon by the later structures\nspanning the street. At any rate it seems likely that originally\nthere was a single room within the balcony.\n\nThe date of the structure directly above the entrance portal\nis hard to say. The vertical joint in the masonry shows that it\ncannot be contemporaneous with the adjoining room\ndiscussed above, and the colour and the texture of the\nstonework seem to indicate that it is not part of the original\nfoundation. Its small triple window composed of twin round-\nheaded windows surmounted by a circular oculus (see fig.\n25.5) offers a clue, however: only two other examples of this\nfeature are known to us in Jerusalem and both are dated to the\nfourth decade of the ninth/fifteenth century.** Consequently, in\nthe absence of more substantial evidence, we might tentatively\ndate this upper floor structure to the same decade, i.e. 830-40/\n1426-36. Here too there are signs of what may be a later\nremodelling of the upper fabric; the stone-paved dome appears\nto be Ottoman for it has no drum but simply rises directly from\nthe adjoining roof. Unfortunately it has not been possible to\nenter to inspect the interior of this part of the building.\n\nGROUND FLOOR (fig. 25.3)\n\nThe entrance doorway leads into a lofty cross-vaulted vestibule,\nbeautifully constructed in dressed stone and lit by a small\nwindow high in the east wall. A stone bench runs around the\nnorth and east walls. The paved floor is level with the paving of\nthe portal recess; a monolithic sill 0.12m high separates the\ntwo.\n\nFrom the south side of the vestibule a pointed arch opens\ninto a short tunnel-vaulted passage (plate 25.8) leading east\ninto the courtyard. A door in the south wall of this passage\nbelongs to a small cell lit by a slit window at the south-west\ncorner of the courtyard. This cell has been annexed to the\nadjoining cell to the east. A cloister-vaulted recess at the west\nend of the passage has a door in its south wall giving access to\n a small dark compartment at the foot of the staircase leading to\nthe roof (described below).\n\nThe original height of the west wall of the courtyard is\ngiven by a short section of moulded cornice (visible in plate\n25.9), while another section similarly preserved at the same\nheight in the east wall suggests that the cornice originally\nextended around all four sides.\n\nThe plan (fig. 25.3) shows the arrangement of twelve cells\naround three sides of the courtyard: three on the south side, six\non the east and three on the north. The entrance vestibule and\nassembly hall occupy the fourth, west side. Each cell has the\nusual pointed-arched doorway with a slit window above (apart\nfrom the door of the annexed cell in the south-west corner,\nwhich has been converted into a window and paired with a\nsimilar window (see plate 25.10)). A staircase against the\neastern range of cells is a later, Ottoman addition; it completely\nblocks one door and partly blocks another.\n\nThe doorway into the corridor at the north-east corner of\nthe courtyard (plate 25.11) is different from those of the cells;\nit is larger, spanned by a flat lintel surmounted by a relieving\narch. A slit window above the relieving arch has a small trefoil\nhead. The door opening has been narrowed with a pile of loose\nstones and a new lintel inserted under the original one. The\ncorridor runs northwards for about two metres before turning\neast where it is lit by the windows set high in the street wall\n\neS Th ae ee)\n (above, p. 301). These windows are accommodated by\nexcisions in the tunnel vault. The corridor is piled high with\nrubble and progress is only possible by crouching in the\nconfined space under the vault itself. At a distance of roughly\nthirteen metres from the entrance, the pile of rubble ends\nabruptly in a sheer drop and a ladder is needed to descend to\na small vestibule behind the blocked street door (mentioned\nabove, p. 301). Before it was blocked this door must have given\naccess through the corridor to the courtyard of the madrasa.\nBeyond the vestibule the corridor continued eastwards but a\nmodern staircase, reinforced with concrete, has been added; it\nrises in three narrow flights within the width of the original\ncorridor to come out among the Ottoman buildings at first\nfloor level. The homogeneity of construction of the Crusader\nstreet wall (the northern boundary of the madrasa) and the\ntunnel-vaulted corridor shows that the two are\ncontemporaneous.\n\nIn the centre of the southern wall of the courtyard a tall\nrecess houses a well-head where water was once drawn froma\ncistern — it is no longer used, having been superseded first by\na second well-head in the middle of the courtyard and latterly\nby mains water supply. The recess remains, however, a\nnoteworthy architectural feature (plate 25.10): behind a\nhoodmould over the recessed voussoirs of a pointed arch is an\nunusual stone vault. This little vault (fig. 25.7) springs from\nthree points: the centre of the rear wall of the recess and the\ntwo internal springing points of the pointed arch. The\ntriangular vaulting pattern thus formed encloses a hexagonal\ncupola with a central pendent muqarnas element identical to\nthe cupola over the inner porch at Bab al-Nazir (plate 35.3)\nwhich was built in 707/1307-8.\n\nIn the west wall of the courtyard a group of three pointed-\n Fig. <0.9 lariq Gab al- Atm: Elevation of east side\n\narched recesses originally emphasized the facade of the\nassembly hall.\n\nNow an Ottoman double vault in front of the north wall of\nthe courtyard conceals the upper part of the two northern\nrecesses but the southern recess remains unobstructed (see\nplate 25.9); its relatively simple decoration consists of one\ncourse of ablaq joggling over the window lintel and ablaq\nwindow jambs.\n\nThe central recess houses the entrance door and is\nsomewhat wider than the flanking recesses (both of which\noriginally held windows) though to judge from the visible\nremains all three rose to the same height. Now that a modern\npartition divides the interior of the assembly hall, the window\nin the northern recess has been converted into a second door.\n\nThe floor of the assembly hall is approximately one metre\nhigher than the level of the courtyard. The ceiling is vaulted in\nthree bays with a small octagonal stone cupola (plate 25.12) at\nthe crown of the central folded cross vault. The hall must\n OEE DONRS UOSEAT UTES UALY WELL Lit Dy 1S SLX WINGOWS, DUC\nthe three western windows are now blocked.\n\nUPPER FLOORS\n\nThe staircase in the south-west corner of the building, covered\nby a rising tunnel vault, makes three flights round a central core\nin rising to the roof over the southern range of cells. It is rather\nbadly lit since there are only the two slit windows opening on\nthe street, one at the first landing and the other at the second,\nthough some light does filter down from an open doorway at\nthe top. About half-way up the third flight is the door of a\ncurious mezzanine room which is dimly lit by a window\nOpening in the upper part of the south wall of the entrance\nvestibule, immediately below the vault (fig. 25.4). The staircase\nevidently existed originally to provide access to this mezzanine\nas well as to the roof-tops around the courtyard and possibly\nthe upper floor room with the balcony (above, p. 302).\n DATE OF CONSTRUCTION\nMujir al-Din (cited above, p. 299) states that ‘I have not been\nable to discover the date of its foundation. It appears that it was\nafter 700 (1300)’. He does not give his reason for proposing\n‘after 700’. The construction must have been before 743/1342\nwhen the founder, al-Majd al-Sallami, died. In order to date it\nmore closely we must rely on the architectural evidence.\n\nSeveral features on the west facade suggest a pronounced\nEgyptian influence on the design: the tall, rectangular window\nrecesses with mugqarnas heads and sloping sills; the angular\nmugqarnas system itself; the sunken panel or ‘inscription band’\nextending onto the facade with ansa and palmette terminals;\nthe recessed door lintel with joggled revetment; the roundels\non either side of the relieving arch over the lintel; 36 and the flat\nstalactite canopy. All these features belong to a specifically\nCairene repertoire.

But the sixth, the flat\nstalactite canopy, can be dated more precisely. The earliest\nCairene parallel to the specially deep recess of the Sallamiyya\nportal covered with a flat stalactite canopy is the entrance portal\nat the Mosque of Almas (730/1330).** Moreover, the fashion for\nsuch deep stalactite canopies was relatively short-lived. There\nare only three other close parallels known to me: the portals at\nthe Mosque of Bashtak (736/1336) (plate 23) the Palace of\nBashtak (738/1337-38)°° and the ‘Palace of Yushbak’ (built for\nQawsin c.738/1337).*°\n\nThus by comparison with the Cairene monuments we\narrive at an approximate range of dates between 730/1330 and\n738/1338. The actual date of construction of the Sallamiyya\nprobably belongs rather to the end of that decade, say c.738/\n1338, when the special vaulting technique had been practised\nin Cairo for some time (see above, p. 99).\n\nTWO BUILDING TEAMS?\n\nThe characteristically Egyptian features outlined above are to\nbe found only on the west facade. There is nothing comparable\nin the interior. The pointed-arched recesses and folded cross\nvault of the assembly hall, and the little mugarnas cupola over\nthe well recess are typically Syrian. We have already remarked\nthat this cupola is identical to the cupola of the eastern porch at\nBab al-Nazir (707/1307-8). A similar feature, though in a\nmodified form to suit the particular structural requirements of\na portal vault, is to be found in Jerusalem also in the mugarnas\ncorbelling of the entrance portal at the Tankiziyya (no. 18).\n\nAnd so it would appear that the construction might have\nbeen undertaken by two teams of builders: a local Syrian team\nwho built the bulk of the structure, and a team of Egyptian\nspecialists sent from Cairo to erect the facade.\n\nThe privilege of having a special team sent from Cairo to\nwork on the Sallamiyya may have been by favour of the sultan.\nThe literary sources include many references to al-Nasir\nMuhammad’s frequent contributions of various kinds,\nincluding builders and architects, to the building works of his\namirs in Cairo.*’ It has been noted above (p. 299) that al-Majd\nal-Sallami was a very important merchant who was responsible\nfor buying mamliuks for al-Nasir Muhammad, and one might\nspeculate that he too benefited in this way.”\n 23 Sijill 58, 69 (4).\n\n24 Sijill 58, 395 (1).\n\n25.

Later on, towards the end of the\nCircassian Mamlik period, three monuments were built in Jerusalem in a\ndistinctly Egyptian style: the Zamani Ribat (881/1476-77), the Muzhiriyya (885/\n1480-81) and the Ashrafivya (887/1482).\n ','IDENTIFICATION, DATE, FOUNDER, MAMLUK PERIOD, OTTOMAN PERIOD, GROUND FLOOR, UPPER FLOORS'),(26,'Al-‘Umari saw the building just a few years after its completion\nand described its position above the Haram portico at its\ncontinuation westwards from the present Bab al-‘Atm and\nmentioned the stairs there, leading to the Almalikiyya and the\nIs‘ardiyya.* The foundation inscription of the Almalikiyya is still\nin situ on the south-facing facade.

There is nothing to connect Almalik’s career with\nJerusalem, nor any mention in any source of his building there.\nHis strictness has been mentioned already, and his preference\nfor the society of the learned and his own scholarship are\nremarked upon. He was the founder of two religious\ninstitutions in Cairo. One was a madrasa near the Shrine of\nHusayn, which he endowed for the instruction of Shafi‘\nlawyers and furnished with a large library. The madrasa was still\nimportant in Maqrizi’s time, but then became a residence for a\nson-in-law of al-Salih.”° The other was a mosque (jami‘) in the\nsuburb of al-Husayniyya outside the Bab al-Nasr, which was\nopened in Jumada I 732/December 1331.72 In 745/1344-45\nAlmalik had an aqueduct built at Mina in the Hijaz.”','As we have seen, the inscription unequivocally attributes the\nconstruction of the madrasa to Almalik. The question of the\nendowment is not clear. This is what Mujir al-Din has to say: Its endowment came from his wife, Ay-malak, the daughter\nof Qutluqtimur al-Nasiri, and the date of the endowment\nwas 16 Rabi’ II 745/27 August 1344. Apparently her\nhusband built it for her with her money, but God knows\nbest. The Defter 602 dates the wagfiyya to this same year and\nattributes it clearly to Ay-malak, and adds that the madrasa is\nknown after her.* The defter published by Ipsirli, no. 522,\nconfuses the names of husband and wife, something which it is\nvery easy to do in the Arabic script, and assigns the endowment\nto Almalik, daughter of Qutluqtimur.” The wife, Ay-malak,\nmust have been intended. However, this latter defter gives the\ndate of the waqfiyya as 757/1356, which further complicates the\nmatter. Indulging in pure speculation one may wonder\nwhether the endowment of 745/1344 was not in truth Almalik’s,\nThat year saw the acme of his power and influence, and we have\nseen that one charitable undertaking is dated to it. Then, after\nhis fall and the temporary eclipse of his family, it was necessary\nto re-endow his madrasa in Jerusalem, and this was done by his\nwife in 757/1356. Confusion arose later from the similarity in\nnames. Nevertheless, there is one further piece of evidence which\nit is difficult to fit into our reconstruction of events. In the Aqsa\nLibrary there is a list of waqfs in favour of the Haram at Hebron,\nwhich was probably drawn up in the early sixteenth century.\nOne tenth of the village of Dayr Bazi‘° which is elsewhere\nclaimed in full as the endowment of the Almalikiyya, is listed as\na waqf of ‘Ay-malak, the daughter of Qutlugtimur al-Silahdar’\non behalf of the Hebron Sanctuary.?” This would strongly\nsuggest that she was also the source of the benefaction for the\nmadrasa, whatever the truth about the division of the income.\nBut what do we make of the date given for this waqf, 16 Rajab\n746/12 November 1345? It is somewhat over a year later than\nthe first date recorded for the waqf of the madrasa and six\nmonths or so before the fall and execution of her husband. It is\nprudent, in the absence of any copies of the wadfiyya or\nwadfiyyas, to leave the facts such as they are, to speak for\nthemselves and to repeat Mujir al-Din’s ‘but God knows best’. The resources for the madrasa which are recorded in the\ndefters were as follows: the complete (but see above) village of\nDayr Bazi’, a shop at the Chain Gate in Jerusalem and several\nproperties in Gaza, namely a caravanserai, seven shops and\nfour store-rooms (makbhazin).8\n PYUDIILYULLAV EL £4LGS MNS\nThe foundation inscription refers only to ‘this blessed place’.\nAlthough al-‘Umari within a few years writes only ofa ‘madrasa’,\nit is clear that the neutral ‘place’ meant a complex which\nincluded a separate ribat for women and also a tomb chamber.\nThree Haram documents deal with the registration of the\neffects of residents in the ribat. All three were Turkish ladies,\nand it is fascinating to find that one, in 795/1393, is described as\n‘the freedwoman of the Lady Ay-malak bint Qutluqtimur al-\nNasiri’, who, incidentally, is not explicitly said to be ‘the\nlate...°° This is another example of dependants enjoying\n‘grace and favour’ residence. An account of the expenditure of waqf income from Dayr\nBazi’ for the tax year 939/1532-33 mentions the beneficiaries,\nincluding several members of the Ibn Jaméa‘a family, through\ntheir functions in the madrasa, and then notes a small sum\ndestined ‘for Fatima al-Yamaniyya personally and the rest of the\nold women (‘@ja’iz) resident with her in the hospice’.* A report\n(1018/1609) on the state of the madrasa and ‘its ribat next to it\nto the north’, apart from completely non-explicit items, refers\nto ‘the ivan in the ribat’ and ‘improving the ribat stairs,\nrenewing the doors of some of the rooms and repairing the\nentrance (bab) of the ribat’, all at a cost of 1,990 paras.*! A\nsimilar later report (1072/1661) lists repairs estimated to cost\n185 Asadi piastres. Parts said to be in a ruined state were ‘the\nsouthern wall dividing the Almalikiyya Madrasa from the\nFarisiyya’ (sic!) and — and this is the only mention of it — ‘the\nturba which is in the madrasa’.** The Amir Almalik was buried\nin his mosque in Cairo.* Although there is no positive\nevidence, it seems reasonable to assume that the cenotaph in\nthe tomb chamber contains the mortal remains of the Lady Ay-\nmalak. The names of several persons who held positions in the\nmadrasa are given by Asali.*4 Some of them, as he suggests,\nwere surely only nominal apppointments. They were mostly\nShafi‘ite in allegiance, which indicates that the madrasa was\nfounded with that law school in mind, as was the case with\nAlmalik’s comparable institution in Cairo. However, confusion\narises in Arabic from the similarity of the name of the madrasa\n(Almalikiyya) to the plural noun meaning ‘lawyers of the Maliki\nschool’ (al-Malikiyya). Hence there is no need to worry how\nIbn Batttita could have met Abu ‘Abdallah Muhammad al-\nGharnati and called him the mudarris of the Almalikiyya in 726/\n1326 before the Almalikiyya existed. The scholar he met in\nJerusalem was ‘the leading teacher of the Malikis (mudarris al-\nMalikiyya)*° and therefore likely to have been attached to the\nAfdaliyya Madrasa, also known as the Dome (al-Qubba) in the\nMoroccans’ Quarter, which had been endowed by al-Afdal, the\nson of Saladin, for the Malikis.*° The same phrase applied to\nanother Maliki scholar, who died in about 750/1349, ‘Abdallah\nb. Sulayman b. ‘Abdallah al-Ansari.3” However, one must take\ninto account the case of Siraj al-Din ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-Rahman, a\nHanbali scholar (died 755/1354), who was ‘shaykh of the\nAlmalikiyya in Jerusalem’. If we accept the reading ‘shaykh of\nthe Malikis (Malikiyya), then we have an even odder\nstatement.*®\n ','','IDENTIFICATION\n\nAl-‘Umari saw the building just a few years after its completion\nand described its position above the Haram portico at its\ncontinuation westwards from the present Bab al-‘Atm and\nmentioned the stairs there, leading to the Almalikiyya and the\nIs‘ardiyya.* The foundation inscription of the Almalikiyya is still\nin situ on the south-facing facade.

All three were Turkish ladies,\nand it is fascinating to find that one, in 795/1393, is described as\n‘the freedwoman of the Lady Ay-malak bint Qutluqtimur al-\nNasiri’, who, incidentally, is not explicitly said to be ‘the\nlate...°° This is another example of dependants enjoying\n‘grace and favour’ residence.\n\nAn account of the expenditure of waqf income from Dayr\nBazi’ for the tax year 939/1532-33 mentions the beneficiaries,\nincluding several members of the Ibn Jaméa‘a family, through\ntheir functions in the madrasa, and then notes a small sum\ndestined ‘for Fatima al-Yamaniyya personally and the rest of the\nold women (‘@ja’iz) resident with her in the hospice’.* A report\n(1018/1609) on the state of the madrasa and ‘its ribat next to it\nto the north’, apart from completely non-explicit items, refers\nto ‘the ivan in the ribat’ and ‘improving the ribat stairs,\nrenewing the doors of some of the rooms and repairing the\nentrance (bab) of the ribat’, all at a cost of 1,990 paras.*! A\nsimilar later report (1072/1661) lists repairs estimated to cost\n185 Asadi piastres. Parts said to be in a ruined state were ‘the\nsouthern wall dividing the Almalikiyya Madrasa from the\nFarisiyya’ (sic!) and — and this is the only mention of it — ‘the\nturba which is in the madrasa’.** The Amir Almalik was buried\nin his mosque in Cairo.* Although there is no positive\nevidence, it seems reasonable to assume that the cenotaph in\nthe tomb chamber contains the mortal remains of the Lady Ay-\nmalak.\n\nThe names of several persons who held positions in the\nmadrasa are given by Asali.*4 Some of them, as he suggests,\nwere surely only nominal apppointments. They were mostly\nShafi‘ite in allegiance, which indicates that the madrasa was\nfounded with that law school in mind, as was the case with\nAlmalik’s comparable institution in Cairo. However, confusion\narises in Arabic from the similarity of the name of the madrasa\n(Almalikiyya) to the plural noun meaning ‘lawyers of the Maliki\nschool’ (al-Malikiyya). Hence there is no need to worry how\nIbn Batttita could have met Abu ‘Abdallah Muhammad al-\nGharnati and called him the mudarris of the Almalikiyya in 726/\n1326 before the Almalikiyya existed. The scholar he met in\nJerusalem was ‘the leading teacher of the Malikis (mudarris al-\nMalikiyya)*° and therefore likely to have been attached to the\nAfdaliyya Madrasa, also known as the Dome (al-Qubba) in the\nMoroccans’ Quarter, which had been endowed by al-Afdal, the\nson of Saladin, for the Malikis.*° The same phrase applied to\nanother Maliki scholar, who died in about 750/1349, ‘Abdallah\nb. Sulayman b. ‘Abdallah al-Ansari.3” However, one must take\ninto account the case of Siraj al-Din ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-Rahman, a\nHanbali scholar (died 755/1354), who was ‘shaykh of the\nAlmalikiyya in Jerusalem’.

Two are not fully legible in the register,\nand only the third, which is called Ard al-‘Ajamiyya, has a figure\nfor revenue against it, namely 400 (aspers).\n\nOTTOMAN PERIOD\n\nNota single reference to the Kilaniyya in the Haram documents\nhas been traced. Other Mamluk sources are equally silent.\nInformation is scanty in the Ottoman period too.\n\nThe two documents alluded to above” describe the\nKilaniyya as a ¢z¢rba in one case and a madrasa in the other. In\nMuharram 985/April 1577 the overseer of the turba, ‘Abd al-\nRaziq b. Shams al-Din b. Abi ‘l-Wafa’ al-Hanafi, reported to the\n qadi that through long neglect the building was in disrepair\nand that the waqf possessed no ready capital and he sought and\ngained permission to spend the income for 983/1575-76 on\nnecessary repairs.!°\n\nWhether the Kilaniyya functioned as a madrasa or with a\nmadrasa extension is difficult to say. The case of the Taziyya\nMausoleum should be borne in mind (see p. 401). At all events\nan appointment of a mudarris, Fadl Allah b. Ghadiya, was made\nin 1129/1716. A series of appointments were made in 1156/\n1743, none of which were specifically madrasa posts.\nMoreover, they were concentrated in one family. Ibrahim al-\nDaudi, deceased, had held a Koran ‘readership’ in the\n‘madrasa’, the lamplighter and sweeper and rent-collector\npositions in the turba, and various posts, shared half and half\nwith his brother, in the ‘madrasa’, i.e. deputy 7dzir, clerk, tomb\nguardian (reading turbaddriyya ?) and another Koran\n‘readership’. His sons took over these positions. The whole\nsituation suggests a family sinecure.\'\n STREET FACADE (fig. 29.5)\n\nThe street frontage is bounded to the west by the first bay of a\nvaulted Crusader building, possibly a market hall\'® (see plan,\nfig. 29.3). To the east the frontage abuts on the Taziyya which,\nthough erected after the Kilaniyya, may occupy the site of an\nearlier building (see below, p. 399).\n\nThe facade (plate 29.1) is symmetrical about its central\naxis. It is completely framed by a cavetto moulding that rises as\na rectangular pediment (pish-taq) over the entrance portal. On\neither side of the entrance, each tomb chamber has two grilled\nwindows set back slightly within a quirked ogee frame\nmoulding (plate 29.2). (The eastern windows are now\nblocked.) The stone course above the lintel of each window is\ndecoratively undercut with a pattern of curves and darts (plate\n29.3) as if to relieve the load on the lintels. The next course\nabove is recessed 1.5cm to form a sunken panel with decorated\n ends that may have been intended for an inscription though\nnone was ever applied. Above the mouldings framing the main\nwindows each tomb chamber has an upper window (plate\n29.4) placed directly over the central mullion of the lower\nwindows. These upper windows are set in identical recesses\nwith sloping sills and muzgarnas heads (plate 29.5).\n\nThe centrally-placed recess for the entrance portal is\n130m deep, crowned by a fluted semidome supported on\nthree tiers of muqarnas corbelling. Remains of stone benches\nflanking the door are barely discernible in Creswell’s 1920\nphotograph (plate 29.6).\'? The masonry course above the\nmonolithic door lintel is undercut to form a thin rectangular\ngroove, apparently intended to suggest visually some reduction\nof direct load on the lintel. The third course above the lintel is\nsunk 0.015m around the recess and onto the facade where it\nends with decorative terminals. Above that course two little\npendentive-like mgarnas elements mark the springing of the\nrobust muqarnas corbelling under the semidome (plate 29.7).\nThe apex of the semidome was repaired with concrete some\ntime after 1920 (see plate 29.8).\n\nAbove the entrance portal three windows open into the\ncentral domed chamber. The middle window, larger than the\nones on either side of it, is set in a meqarnas-headed recess.\nThe masonry course above the lintels of the flanking windows\nis undercut in the same way as the lower windows of the\neastern and western tomb chambers.\n\nThe three domes rise above the facade, the central one\nabout 1.20m higher than those of the tomb chambers (which\nare partly obscured by modern parapet walls). The central and\neastern domes rest on octagonal drums pierced by eight\nwindows; those in the central drum are rectangular and those\nin the eastern drum round-headed. The western drum is\nsixteen sided and has eight round-headed windows. All the\ndrums have simple splay-faced cornices.\n\nVESTIBULE (fig. 29.3; sections, figs. 29.6 and 29.7)\n\nThe original iron-plated doors (plate 29.9) survive, though\nonly the left-hand one now opens.” It leads down one step into\na vestibule roofed by a folded cross vault with a small cupola at\nthe crown. This vault is no longer visible from the vestibule\nsince a later vault has been inserted to provide an extra floor\n(see section, fig. 29.7). In the east and west walls of the vestibule\nare doors into the tomb chambers. The eastern one is now\nblocked but the western one retains its original timber double\nleafed doors which are bound by four brass straps. The floors\nof the tomb chambers are about 0.90m higher than the floor of\nthe vestibule and the thresholds of the doors into these\nchambers are a similar height above the vestibule floor. There\nmust originally have been steps up to the doors but nothing\nsurvives now apart from piles of rubble against the walls.\n\nWESTERN TOMB CHAMBER\n eS ee\n\nPlate 29.8 Mugarnas s\n\n~\n\nSoom 2 Rea\nemidome of portal\n\nwest wall. Originally it rose the full height to the apex of the\ndome (11.15m) but was subsequently divided by two later\nvaults to provide extra accommodation. Evidently it was\nintended for a tomb since there is a barrel-vaulted crypt under\nthe floor, which can be seen through a recent breach in the\nlower wall of the vestibule (section, fig. 29.7). Whether or not\nany burial was ever made there is not known, but it seems\nunlikely: there is no mention of one in the texts and no trace of\none is visible.”!\n\nThe chamber was lit by windows on three levels. At the\nlowest level are two pairs of originally grilled windows, one\npair in the south wall opening in the street facade (described\nabove) and the other pair (now much altered) in the north wall\nopening on the courtyard. The southern pair of windows retain\ntheir double leaf timber shutters bound like the door leaves\nwith four bands of brass. A middle-level window opens in the\nsouth wall and, at the top of the chamber, are eight windows in\nthe drum. The interior of the drum is eight sided though the\nexterior is sixteen sided.\n\nEASTERN TOMB CHAMBER\n\nThis chamber is similar in size and shape to the western one\napart from a tall pointed-arched recess in its east wall, at the\nrear of which there is a small cupboard. The arch of the recess\nsprings from two re-used columns with ‘thick leaf Crusader\ncapitals and ‘water-holding’ bases (fig. 29.7).\n\nThe chamber was damaged by fire in 1938 but traces of an\ninterlaced triple bead moulding (ig. 29.7, plate 29.10) planted\nin the plaster around the arch, door and window openings still\nexist in places. Like the western chamber this one has been\ndivided by two later floors.\n\nIt is lit by an arrangement of windows identical to that of\nthe western chamber except for an extra north-facing window\nat the middle level. At the same level smooth pendentives\n(plate 29.11) rise to support the eight-sided drum.\n\nIn the middle of the floor a stone cenotaph with plastered\nsides and curious triple humps running lengthwise from east to\nwest (figs. 29.3 and 29.7) marks a grave, presumably that of\nJamal al-Din, who commissioned the building and is buried in\nit, according to Mujir al-Din. The area under the floor is\ninaccessible but it may reasonably be assumed that there is a\ncrypt here like the one under the western chamber.\n\nCOURTYARD\nA door at the north end of the vestibule opens directly into the\ncourtyard. It retains much of its original paving at a level 0.85m\nbelow that of the street and this difference in levels is\naccommodated by two steps within the vestibule and another\ntwo in the courtyard itself. The latter two steps are modern but\nmust replace earlier steps (as shown in the axonometric\nreconstruction, fig. 29.9).\n\nAt the north side of the courtyard two barrel-vaulted halls\nappear to have existed before the construction of the Kilaniyya;\n these defined the northern boundary of the site. The Crusader\nhalls (above, p. 327) defined the western boundary, and the\neastern boundary may have been defined by some pre-existing\nstructure which was later incorporated into the Taziyya. The\ntomb chambers and vestibule next to the street form the\nsouthern boundary.\n\nWithin these limits the builders of the Kildniyya clearly\nendeavoured to provide as large a courtyard as possible. But its\noriginal arrangement is no longer obvious. On the north side\nthe pre-existing wall seems merely to have been heightened\nand re-faced. But the west and east walls have been largely\nrebuilt and are obscured by modern outbuildings in the\ncourtyard. Both are discernible, however, in the plan (fig.\n29.3).\n\nAt the centre of each wall is a broad recess originally\nspanned by a tall pointed arch, as shown in the east wall by\nvoussoirs remaining in situ on the right-hand side. These show\nthe initial arrangement, for the ashlar masonry coursing next to\nthe voussoirs matches that of the south wall which is\nundoubtedly original. The upper structure of the west wall has\ndisappeared but its plan is still visible.\n\nThe recesses in the two walls were designed to mirror\neach other, but they differ in depth. That in the west wall is\n1.80m deep from front to back, and that in the east only 1.03m.\nThe difference is explained by the differing uses made of the\nspaces behind the walls on either side. Giving access to these,\nthere is in each wall a pair of rectangular doors placed\nsymmetrically at the north and south ends. On the east side the\ntwo doors lead only into tiny chambers measuring 1.30 x 2.04m\nand 0.58 x 1.15m respectively. On the west side the door at the\nsouth end gives access to a narrow passage running south to a\nwell-head (now blocked).” The similar door at the north end\nof the wall opens into a staircase (see below). These four\ndoorways survive intact.\n\nThe south wall of the courtyard (fig. 29.8) is also built\nmostly of fine ashlar masonry. Above the door from the\nvestibule, the masonry rises in a tall pish-taq framed by a cavetto\nmoulding (plate 29.12). This moulding extends at slightly\ndifferent levels on either side of the pish-taq across the walls of\nthe tomb chambers. At the south-west corner of the courtyard\nit turns and continues for a short distance along the west wall.\nOriginally it must have extended around the four sides of the\ncourtyard; a short length of it survives i sitz at the same level\nat the west end of the north wall (see below). Above the\nmoulding on either side of the pish-taq, the upper walls of the\n tomb chambers are built of coursed, snecked rubble rendered\nwith a plaster facing of which substantial traces survive. The\nmiddle-level window of the eastern tomb chamber opens in\nthe lowest courses of that rubble masonry and, in the\ncorresponding position on the west side of the pish-tdq, a\nsomewhat smaller window lights a staircase leading to the\ncentral domed chamber (see below). Directly above the\nvestibule door there is a window intended to light the vestibule\nand, above that, three windows in the ashlar masonry of the\npish-taq light the central domed chamber.\n\nPlastered rubble masonry appears to have been used also\nfor the upper walls on the other three sides of the courtyard,\nthough it survives now only at the south end of the west wall\nand at the west end of the north wall. The original height of\nthese walls was 9.28m; at that height the remains of stepped\nundercut crenellations survive i situ on either side of the pish-\ntaq at the south wall and at the west end of the north wall. These\ncrenellations, unique in Jerusalem, must have crowned all four\nwalls of the courtyard (but not the pish-iaq), as suggested in fig.\n29:9:\n\nNORTHERN HALLS\n\nAt the north side of the courtyard are two barrel-vaulted halls.\nThey share roughly the same alignment, about 6° askew on a\nline drawn perpendicular to the west wall of the courtyard. This\ndifferent orientation seems to indicate that these halls predate\nthe construction of the Kilaniyya. The eastern hall incorporates\nstones bearing Crusader masons’ marks, indicating that it\ncannot be earlier than the sixth/twelfth century. The north walls\nof the halls appear to coincide more or less with the northern\nboundary line, if produced westward, of an underlying bridge”\nwhich spans eastwards across the town’s central (‘Tyropoeon’)\nvalley, al-Wad, towards the Haram.\n\nThe eastern hall is not accessible from the Kilaniyya and, to\njudge from the complete absence of openings in its south wall,\nit never was. The western hall appears, however, to have been\nincorporated into the Mamlik foundation, though the present\ndoor and windows under a half-arch (plate 29.13) in its south\nwall are obviously of relatively recent construction. The rest of\nthe north wall of the courtyard appears also to be modern,\nthough perhaps only a re-facing of the earlier wall since the\nvault beyond it is intact. Two blind arches in the masonry of this\nwall seem to have been intended to improve its stability; they\ndo not correspond to either of the recesses in the south wall of\nthe eastern hall (see plan, fig. 29.3).\n UPPER FLOORS (plans, figs. 29.3 and 29.4)\n\nOn the upper level there appear to have been only two rooms,\none over the entrance vestibule (described below) and one\nover the western hall at the north-west corner of the courtyard.\nThe latter is reached now by a modern stairway, the original\nstaircase having disappeared. It is possible to reconstruct that\noriginal staircase in the very limited space available as shown in\nfig. 29.9. The unusually narrow stairs (0.68m wide) can be\nexplained by the builders’ desire to keep the courtyard as wide\nas possible (see above). Within the door at the north end of the\nwest wall the stairs rose immediately to the left, wound through\n360°, and continued up to a small landing. From the landing the\nupper floor room is reached up three steps through a narrow\npointed-arched doorway (0.79m wide) into a tunnel-vaulted\npassageway leading up one more step to a cross-vaulted\nantechamber. From there a pointed arch opens into a large hall\nto the east.\n\nThe tripartite vaulting of this hall is distinctive: a central\nfolded cross vault with a fluted cupola at the crown and flanked\nby cross vaults at its north and south ends. This system of\nvaulting, similar to that of the gd as in the Palace of Sitt Tunshuq\n(no. 48) and the Tashtamuriyya (no. 45), suggests that the room\nwas intended to serve as a reception hall. It is the only large\nroom in the complex. (The adjoining elaborately decorated\ndomed room to the east is a later, Ottoman addition entered\nfrom the Taziyya.) Paired rectangular windows surmounted by\na circular oculus and a smaller rectangular window open in the\nreception hall’s south wall (plate 29.13), which is the only part\nof the north wall of the courtyard to retain its original form.\nThe segmental-arched window in the north wall of the hall is a\nlater insertion.\n\nThe staircase serving the reception hall described above\ncontinued from the landing beside the entrance to the hall up\nto a covered gallery running behind the upper part of the west\nwall of the courtyard (see fig. 29.9). Further flights of steps at\neither end of that gallery led up to the roofs of the western tomb\nchamber and of the reception hall at its south and north end\nrespectively. Only the uppermost steps of these stairs survive.\nThe shaving of the drum of the western tomb chamber, giving\n it sixteen sides instead of eight, was presumably to permit\neasier passage to the windows of the central domed chamber\nwhere Koran readings might have been held (see below).\n\nThe central domed chamber was reached by a separate\nstaircase built mainly within the thickness of the north wall of\nthe western tomb chamber (plate 29.14). The lower part of the\nstaircase has disappeared and has been replaced in recent\ntimes by a flight of steps against the north wall of the western\ntomb chamber. So far as we can tell, the original staircase was\nentered from a door in the south side of the arched recess in\nthe middle of the west wall of the courtyard (see fig. 29.9). From\nthere it rose south to a small landing where it turned eastwards\nin the thickness of the tomb chamber wall. At the top the stairs\nskew southwards to open into the central domed chamber. A\nsimilar opening (now blocked) in the north-east corner of the\nchamber led out to the roof of the eastern tomb chamber, from\nwhich it may once have led down to a gallery along the east side\nof the courtyard.\n\nThe central domed chamber over the vestibule has three\nwindows in the south wall overlooking the street, three in its\nnorth wall overlooking the courtyard, two in its west wall (one\nnow blocked) into the western tomb chamber, two in its east\nwall (one now blocked) into the eastern tomb chamber, and\neight (all blocked) in the drum, which supports an internally\nfluted dome (fig. 29.7). Obviously eighteen windows are more\nthan were required for light and ventilation; indeed, the room\nmust have been exceedingly uncomfortable in winter. Since\nthe foundation included at least one Koran reader, the most\nlikely reason for this profusion of openings was to enable\nreadings in this room to be heard in the street, in the courtyard\nand (since there were windows in both tomb chambers)\n‘within the hearing of the dead’, as one writer puts it.”\n\nINSCRIPTION (plate 29.15)\n\nAn inscribed stone plaque was recovered in 1969 from debris\non the floor of the eastern tomb chamber. It is now housed in\nthe Haram Museum. The inscribed surface is very badly\ndamaged, apparently by being recut for use as a paving slab,\nand the six lines of text are generally indecipherable. Lines 2-3\nappear, however, to read\n\n... the High Amir [Sharaf] al-Din ‘Isa b.

Hanauer, who\nthought it was part of the Church of St. Giles (‘The Churches of St. Martin and St.\n John the Evangelist’, PEFQS, 1893, 303-4). The form of the building, difficult to\ndetermine nowadays, is not that of a church but rather that of some commercial\nstructure. The cross-vaulted bays, divided by transverse arches, spring from\nlimestone columns with simple capitals (fig. 29.11). The upper storey appears to\nbe of Ottoman construction. The masonry is pierced by a window with an arch of\ngadroon voussoirs (now hidden behind a timber oriel window and part of the\nqa@a of the Tashtamuriyya, no. 45). The remains of a corbel, apparently of\nCrusader workmanship, survive alongside that window.\n\n19 Benches shown intact in T.

The northern walls of the halls attached to the Kilaniyya\nare approximately parallel to that boundary line. Part of this area under the bridge\nwas examined archaeologically in 1931, the evidence suggesting that the central\narch of the bridge was early Islamic with later extensions, including stones with\ncharacteristic Crusader dressing, added to north and south (R.W.

For\ninstance, the Amir Kha’irbak al-Zahiri Khushqadam, who was\nknown as the ‘Sultan for a Night’, having moved from his more\nextreme exile in Mecca, died a year later, 879/1474, in the\nKhatiniyya.” Another amir, Jani Beg, arrested at ‘Aqaba in\nMuharram 883/April 1478 and sent to Jerusalem, died in the\nKhatiiniyya in Rajab/October of the same year.!° The governor\nof Damascus, Qansth al-Yahyawi, blamed for a defeat before\n Edessa at the hands of the Karakoyunlu, was despatched to\nJerusalem in 886/1481 and took up residence in the Khatuniyya\nMadrasa.\" Finally, the Amir Yashbak al-Jamali died there in 901/\n1496.\"\n\nOTTOMAN PERIOD\nThe administration of the Khatiiniyya and its endowments was\nin the hands of the Ibn Jama‘a family. Such is the inference to be\ndrawn from various entries in the Court Records. Hafiz al-Din\n‘Abd al-Nabi b. Jama‘a, mufti in Jerusalem, became shaykh with\na daily salary of two aspers in 964/1557,\"° and the post of\nbawwab was divided by 982/1575 in a way that seems typical of\ninstitutions which have lost their active role and become family\nsinecures, one half of the post passing to a brother (Taha), and\na quarter to a son (Ahmad), of the deceased previous holder,\nMuhyi al-Din b. Jama‘a.\'4\n\nThe same Taha b. Jama‘a, now appearing as administrator\n of the waqf, presented an account of the 982/1574-75 income\nfrom the ‘Camel’s Belly’ and rent of a house and mill in\nJerusalem:”°\n The same wadf property in 986/1578 was contracted by the\nadministrator, Taha b.

However, there is no certainty that\nthat was part of a regular public course.” It could have been a\nprivate arrangement in effectively private accommodation.\nOne should note the case of the Qadi Ghars al-Din Khalil al-\nKinani, a former shaykh of the Salahiyya, and therefore most\ncertainly a Shafi\'7, who returned to Jerusalem in 879/1475 in the\nhope of benefiting from his friendship with the newly\nappointed governor, Jar Qutli al-Zahiri, and took up residence\nin the Arghiiniyya.” Some years later, a governor of Jerusalem\nand Superintendent of the Two Harams, Amir Khidr Beg, lived\nin the Arghiiniyya, as one gathers from the fact that, after his\ndeath in Sha‘ban 897/June 1492, his brother and successor,\nJanbalat, came with witnesses to recover effects, including 700\ndinars, which had been sealed ‘in a cupboard in his brother\'s\nhouse in the Arghtiniyya Madrasa’, but, as it happened, found\nthe chest broken into and the money gone.”\n\nOTTOMAN PERIOD\n\nScattered references to the Arghtniyya in the Jerusalem Court\nrecords mainly concern appointments and salaries. In Jumada\nIl 968/February 1561 the mudarris, Shams al-Din Muhammad\nb. Zayn al-Din was paid three previous years’ salary at the rate\nof nine aspers a day.”’ A Koran ‘readership’ in the Arghiniyya\nwas one of seven posts held in different institutions by Muhyi\nal-Din b. Jama‘a up to his death in 982/1575. Close relatives\nfollowed him in all of them, except that the Arghiiniyya post\nwent to Badr al-Din Muhammad b. Jamal al-Din b. Abi al-Lutf, a\nShafi\'.”° In 1021/1612 a similar post was inherited by one\nmember of the Ibn al-Samit family from another.”\n\nThe Defterdar of Damascus instructed the inspector and\nhis wakil — they were brothers, members of the Ibn Abi al-Lutf\nfamily — to apply the revenue of 979/1571-72 and subsequent\nyears if necessary to the repair of the. madrasa and ‘to give\nprecedence to the repair of the fabric over the payment of\nsalaries’. The estimated expenditure was as follows;?8\n\nTo repair of 3 zvdans, 2 rooms and new paving for\n Total 4,084 paras\n\nThe revenue of 981/1573-74 amounted to 61 gold pieces,\nthat is 2,440 paras. Official salaries took 45 and fourteen Koran\nreaders received 15, since one person had two gold pieces. The\nmudarris, who was Muhammad b. Abi al-Wafa’ al-Husayni al-\nHanafi received 20, the inspector (the same person as the\nmudarris) 9, the Shaykh of the madrasa, Shams al-Din b. Abi al-\nLutf, 5. The clerk also received 5 and the bawwdab and the\nattendance clerk 3 each. That left one for administrative costs in\nTripoli and Jerusalem.”\n\nBy 1020/1611 the mutawalli was ‘Abd al-Qadir b. Ajmal b.\nal-Dahhan. He managed to collect only 88 out of 100 piastres\nowing to the waqf, and paid out 141. Recipients of 56% piastres\nwere fifteen faqirs (sic).*°\n\nAsali has noted a number of other appointments within the\nArghiiniyya recorded in the sijills. In the late eighteenth century\nthe post of shaykh went to a member of the al-‘Afifi family, and\n\nthe madrasa became known as ‘Afifi House because of their\noccupation of it.!\n\nMODERN HISTORY\n\nThe courtyard and iwéins of the madrasa were refurbished in\n1931 when King Husayn I, leader of the Arab Revolt during\nWorld War I, was buried in the east zvan.

The passage might be taken to mean that al-Nasir\nHasan initially planned the madrasa in Jerusalem, which is very\nplausible in view of his many other foundations in his second\nreign (755-62/1354-61), including madrasas in Hebron, Tripoli\nand Aleppo, not to mention his magnificent madrasa in Cairo.\nThere is a slight problem. If Manjak was sent to take\nresponsibility for the Sultan’s madrasa, he cannot be said to\nhave chosen Jerusalem for his tarkban residence. Yet the\nchoice of place of residence was his. The Sultan’s order (tawq?)\nis quoted by Ibn Khatib al-Nasiriyya from Ibn Habib’s history\nunder the year 761, including this sentence: ‘Thus it has been\nordered that the aforementioned should be tarkhan, residing\nwherever he wishes’.’ The text quoted by Mujir al-Din does not\nactually say that he was ordered to build by the Sultan. One\ncould understand that Manjak was acting on his own initiative,\nplanning to win the favour of the Sultan by building the\nmadrasa in the Sultan’s name.’ Mujir al-Din does not give a clear date for the\ncommencement or the completion of the Manjakiyya Madrasa.”\nNu‘aymi (d. 927/1521), who wrote later than Mujir al-Din,\nplaces the construction of Manjak’s ‘khangah and madrasa’ in\nJerusalem during his period of residence there.!° But is this\nbased on any independent evidence? If one considers the date\nof the endowment, which presupposes the completion of the\nbuilding, then there is again some lack of clarity. The two late\nsixteenth-century land registers available provide conflicting\ndates for the wagfiyya of Manjak. No. 522 gives 770/1368-69,!!\nand no. 602 773/1371-72.\'2 However, there is some sense in\naccepting dates of about that period, since, as we shall see,\nManjak became governor of Damascus for the second time in\n769/1368 and remained there for six years. If we accept that the\nerection of the madrasa was begun, and even completed, in the\nperiod 761-62/1360-61, Manjak’s immediate participation in the\nrevolt against Yalbugha and his subsequent five and half years’\nimprisonment could have spelt the temporary eclipse of his\nfoundation, which would have needed re-endowment on his\nreturn to power and affluence.\"','The second stage of his career begins after the accession of\nal-Nasir Hasan and the appointment of his own brother,\nBaybugha Rus, to be viceroy in Cairo. Manjak was brought to\ncourt in Shawwal 748/January 1348 and given the posts of vizier 38S\n Mamtuk Jerusdiem and major-domo.\"? This period of power lasted nearly three\nyears with one slight interruption of forty days. He was one of\nthe ruling circle of amirs, which included his brother, the\nviceroy, Shaykhi al-‘Umari and Taz (see p. 399). The balance\nbetween the rivals in the oligarchy was very delicate. When\nBaybugha and Taz went on pilgrimage in 751/1350, Sultan\nHasan asserted himself, urged on without a doubt by two amirs,\nManglibugha al-Fakhri and Mughultay. Manjak was arrested in\nShawwal/December of that year.” His first imprisonment in\nAlexandria lasted about eight months. After quite bewildering changes of alliance amongst the\namirs and a change of sultan —al-Salih Salih came to the throne\nin Jumada II 752/August 1351 — Manjak was released’ and his\nbrother, Baybugha, freed from his confinement in Kerak, was\nsent to be governor in Aleppo.” In a brief interlude Manjak\nconspired with his brother but the plot was discovered; Manjak\nwas restored to his cell in Alexandria”? and Baybughi, having\nfailed in his revolt, was after a while put to death. This time\nManjak spent about twenty months in prison. As the amirs\ncontinued to play their deadly game of factional politics, Manjak\nwas released through the influence of Shaykht and sent to\nSafad as a battal (755/spring 1354).”* There followed a particularly complicated period of his\nlife. Soon after the return of the Sultan al-Nasir Hasan, Manjak\nwas given the governorship of Tripoli in Dht’l-Qa‘da 755/\nDecember 1354.” After the arrest of Taz, Manjak was\ntransferred to Aleppo in 759/1358,”° and after only a little while\nmoved to Damascus. He remained governor there until\nMuharram 760/December 1358, when he was dismissed,\nsummoned to Cairo, but at Gaza fled into hiding.” Arrested\noutside Damascus a little over a year later, he was pardoned by\nSultan Hasan, given an amirate of 40 and declared to be\ntarkhdan, free to choose his place of residence.”* In Cairo Sultan Hasan was overthrown in Jumada I 762/\nMarch 1361. The regent of the new ruler, al-Manstr\nMuhammad, was Yalbugha al-‘Umari. Manjak joined the revolt\nof the then governor of Damascus, Baydamur, against him. Both\nwere seized by treachery outside Damascus (Ramadan 762/\nAugust 1361), and once more Manjak found himself in prison at\nAlexandria.” This time, the third, he stayed there for five anda\nhalf years. The political map again changed greatly in his absence. Al-\nMansi was deposed (Sha‘ban 764/May 1363) and succeeded\nby al-Ashraf Sha‘ban, aged 10 years. Yalbugha, who continued\nas regent, was killed by his mamliks in Rabi‘ II 768/December\n1366. Freed once more, Manjak began the last stage of his life\nand nearly eight years of power and influence. In Muharram\n769/September 1367 he was governor of Tripoli,*° before being\ntransferred to govern Damascus by Jumada I 769/January\n1368.°\' His last move was made in Dhii\'l-Hijja 775/May 1374\nwhen he made a magnificent entry into Cairo, there to be given\ncomplete authority throughout the state.*? A little over a year\nlater De fell ill and died on Thursday, 29 Dhi\'l-Hijja 776/31 May\n13755 Manjak was praised for his public works: ‘He was . . . active\nin promoting the welfare of the people and fond of buildings.\nHe acquired fine properties and selected beautiful old\nbuildings/monuments, and renovated (ammara) several\nmosques, Sufi convents and hospices, and erected several\npublic caravanserais in Egypt and Syria, indeed throughout the\nkingdom.

It consisted of: (i) The whole bath at Safad, formerly known as the Citadel\nBath* and now as the New Bath. (ii) Three shops known as the Wakala (lit. caravanserai) at\nJerusalem. (iii) 1 share (42) of the g@ a (hall) at the top of the Harafish Hill\nin Jerusalem. (iv) Rent (bikr) of a plot of land west of Jerusalem known by the\nname of the waqif and as the Charity Land. (v) 6 shares and a third and an eighth ofa share of the village of\nBayt Safafa in the Jerusalem district. (vi) A parcel of land known as Manjak’s Land and Charity Land\nin the Jerusalem district. Item (vi) is only found in no. 522, as a separate entry. The\nincome of item (iv) is given in no. 522 as 1,513 aspers and in no.\n602 as 1,510. As for item (i), the bath at Safad, register no. 522\nhas an entry“ which declares one fifth of its revenue to belong\nto the Adhamiyya Zawiya at Jerusalem, which contradicts the\nstatement that it was wholly an endowment of the madrasa. It is\nrecorded that Manjak built the zawiya of the Adhamiyya Sifis\nnorth of the old city and that he and other ‘pious people’\nprovided endowments for it. That the rights of the zawiya were\nsometimes overlooked is demonstrated by a document in the\nJerusalem sijills® in which the administrator of the zawiya laid\nclaim to a fifth of the Bath’s income, had recourse to the terms\nof Manjak’s waqf instrument, stating that ‘no more than two\nthousand dirhams should be expended annually from the\nincome and rents of the said Bath’, declared that his\npredecessor had agreed with the father of the present\nadministrator of the madrasa that the 2,000 dirhams of the\noriginal wagf should be understood to be 2,000 aspers, and\nthen acknowledged receipt of the zawiya’s share for five years\n(ending 983/1576), namely 40 gold pieces.','No mention has been found in the Court registers of any\ndamage suffered by the madrasa in the major earthquake of\nJanuary 1546. Doubtless there was some. A ‘small room’\nbelonging to the madrasa and over part of the Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-\nDin collapsed along with the vault below (see p. 119). In 959/\n1552 29 paras were spent on clearing the drain of the madrasa\nprivy and in 961/1554 353 paras were paid out for the repair of\n‘the residence on the roof (gasr al-sath) .® One of the earliest, if not the first, of the heads (shaykhs)\nof the Manjakiyya was Shams al-Din Muhammad b. ‘Abdallah b.\nSa‘d al-Dayri (c.750-827/1349-1424).? He was succeeded by his\nson, Sa‘d al-Din Sa‘d (d. 867/1462-63).* By the sixteenth\ncentury, a member of this same family, Sharaf al-Din Musa al-\nDayri, had become, to all appearances, the administrator of the\nwaqf of the madrasa in addition to the headship (mashyakba),\naccording to documents that cover the period 943-962/1536-\n1555.”! The al-Dayri family were all Hanafis, which has led to\nthe assumption that that was the chosen school for the madrasa.\nHowever, in two court documents dated 984 and 1018/1576\nand 1608, the administrator is named as Zayn al-Din Ishaq b.\n ‘Umar b Abi ‘I-Lutf, who was Sh4fi7 mufti in Jerusalem.” In fact,\none of these documents makes it clear that Zayn al-Din was only\nthe deputy administrator — and this was doubtless true of the al-\nDayri family earlier — acting for a descendant of Manjak, the\nAmir Muhammad Pasha. This latter had written to his deputy\nthat ‘it has come to my attention that the waqf of the madrasa is\nruined and that the entitled persons are not receiving their\nstipends’. The deputy requested the Qadi to summon the\npeople concerned and to ask them whether they were\nreceiving their stipends annually or not. All, including the\nmudarris, Abt ’| Fath b. Abi ’I-Lutf, the mz 7d, Salih al-Dayri, the\nusual range of waqf officials and twenty-four readers of Koran\nparts, return a contented positive answer. The fabric of the\nmadrasa is also attested to be in good order (amira). One\nshould recall that in 901/1496 Mujir al-Din had written: ‘In our\nown time it has fallen into a sorry state. God alone gives\nsuccess!’ A note added to the entry of the Manjakiyya Madrasa in\nDefter no. 522 reads: “The income surplus to the expenditure\non the madrasa belongs to the descendants of the founder.”\nProbably Manjak also designated his direct descendants to\nsucceed himself as administrator in the terms of his waqfiyya.\nIf he acted similarly with all, or even some of, his other\nendowments,” that might help to explain the continuity and\nlasting importance of his family. They are easily traceable\nthrough biographical dictionaries down to a third Manjak\n(1007-1080/1598-1669), with whom the family fortunes began\nto fade.® The father of this Manjak is the Muhammad (d. 1032/\n1623) referred to above.*’ Of several persons it is expressly\nstated that they administered the endowments of the family. During van Berchem’s 1914 visit the Manjakiyya\nfunctioned as a boys’ school. It later served as a private\ndwelling’® until it was converted into offices for the\nDepartment of Awqaf in 1342/1923, and such it remains until\nNow.\n ','IDENTIFICATION oe\nThis madrasa was located by Mujir al-Din at the Bab al- Nazir, as\none of the institutions found on the west side of the Haram.\" Its\nidentification has also been discussed by van Berchem,\nalthough it is anepigraphic, and thus would not normally fall\nwithin his scope.>\n\nDATE\n\nIn the absence of a foundation inscription, there is some doubt\nabout when the madrasa was built and also when it was\nendowed. Mujir al-Din wrote:\n AL-Manjakiyya\n\nHe [ie. Manjak] was ordered to reside in Jerusalem as\ntarkban. He came to the city in Safar 761 [December 1359-\nJanuary 1360]. In a certain history [it is written that] ‘He\ncame to Jerusalem to build the madrasa for the Sultan al-\nMalik al-Nasir Hasan’.

He is commonly given the nisha al-\nYusufi, but as far as is known, it is nowhere explained to whom\nthat refers. His career was a very chequered one, full of incident\nand many changes of fortune. He appears in the chronicles in\nthe year 745/1344, when, as silahdar (swordbearer), he\nbrought the head of the deposed al-Nasir Ahmad from Kerak to\nCairo.\'° In Rabi‘ II 745/August 1344 he was made an amir of\ntablkhana rank\'® and in the following year he was\ncommissioned to investigate the Amir Almalik in Safad and\nthen to bring him to Cairo (see p. 308). After the arrest of the\ngovernor of Damascus, Yalbugha al-Yahyawi, it was again\nManjak who was dispatched to procure the rebel’s head\nQumada II 748/September 1347).\'’ Perhaps as a reward for\nthese efforts, in Rajab 748/November 1347 Manjak was\npromoted to be Amir of 100 and Chamberlain (Hajib) of\nDamascus.\'®\n\nThe second stage of his career begins after the accession of\nal-Nasir Hasan and the appointment of his own brother,\nBaybugha Rus, to be viceroy in Cairo.

We read\nin the Defter no. 602 as follows:\"®\n\nThe waqdf of the Taziyya Madrasa in the Bab al-Silsila:\n\n(i) the village of Minya’? in Safad district — complete.\nIncome... [blank].\n\n(ii) a shop together with the baker’s oven in the said village\n— complete.\n\n(iii) a mill (taht) in the said village — complete.\n\nNo date is given for the waqfiyya.\n\nMAMLUK PERIOD\n\nThe Haram documents contain several pieces which concern\nthe Taziyya, which is in all of them called ‘the mausoleum\n(turba) of his late Excellency Sayf al-Din Taz’, except in one\ncase (see no. 595 discussed below). Six documents contain\nappointments (phrased like administrative decrees, marsiims)\nmade by the nazir of the waqf, an Amir Sayf al-Din, whose\nidentity might have remained a mystery, were it not that no. 7\n(verso) had a cursive note which we read as ‘Written by Aba\nBakr b. Taz’? This suggests that Taz according to common\npractice had nominated his own family to be the overseers of\nhis endowment.\n\nAll these appointments, Or re-appointments, are of a\ncertain Burhan al-Din Ibrahim al-Nasiri, whose other affairs,\nboth before and after his death, feature prominently in the\nHaram documents:\n On the recto of no. 310 is Burhan al-Din’s petition for the\npost, in which he urges that he is ‘poor and a family man, a\n“bearer” of the Book of God and a student of religious\nlearning’. Indeed, he claimed elsewhere” that he had been\nstudying Tradition for six years without a stipend. In the\npetition on the recto of no. 7 he asks to be allowed to keep the\nappointments he holds (al-taqdrir), namely reciting at the\nfounder\'s catafalque (al-qird’a ‘ala’l-darih), the post of fagih\nand the reciting of the ‘tenth’.\n\nOne may readily imagine a similar document being issued\nto Shams al-Din Muhammad b. Hamid b. Ahmad al-Ansari al-\nShafi\'T (732-782/1331-1381), who ‘held the post of mudarris in\nthe Taziyya Madrasa.’*? A member of the Qalgashandi family,\nSharaf al-Din ‘Abd al-Rahman (769-820/1368-1418) is another\nperson known to have taught law in the Taziyya.”* These two\ncases, plus that of Burhan al-Din who was faqih (student of\nlaw), are early evidence for that wider role of the Taziyya\nreferred to above. A Sifi of the Bistamiyya order, Shams al-Din\n‘Isa al-Shafi‘i (d. 875/1471) ‘taught the Koran to children at the\nTaziyya Madrasa’. Other evidence will confirm that the\ncomplex included a Koran school. From the madbbhab\naffiliation of these appointees one may assume that Taz made\nhis foundation with the Shafi‘is in mind.\n\nAn interesting list of effects left to the Taziyya Madrasa as an\nendowment is contained in Haram document no. 595, dated\nmid-Safar 781/2 June 1379. The objects were received by the\nbawwab, the Shaykh Musa b. Sulayman, after the death of the\nwaqif, a Shaykh ‘Abd al-Wahid. The inventory includes two\ncomplete boxed Koran sets, nine bound volumes of religious\nworks, twenty-seven lamps (one gilded, four ‘with brass heads’,\nthe rest painted), various hangings and curtains, amongst them\nthree tomb coverings, blue, white and black, and eleven\ncarpets.”°\n\nOTTOMAN PERIOD\nIn what follows details are given from a series of accounts of the\napplication of the waqf income taken from the Jerusalem sijills.\nIt is important to underline the appearance of payments to\norphans in the Koran school and for students of law, and also to\nstress the sums expended or earmarked for repairs both of the\nTaziyya itself and of its revenue-producing properties. It may be\nrash to say so, but there is every sign that the waqf was managed\nefficiently. The surplus for 944/1537-38, see para. (i) below, is\nmarked ‘to be allocated to the peasants of Minya’. That sum, like\nthe one thousand paras of the 979-80/1571-73 account, see (v),\nwas a loan to the peasants, called quvwa (lit: power, support).””\n(i) A/c for year 944/1537-38 (nazir: Abu ’l-Wafa’ b.

He\nhimself died in the zawiya (or simply ‘at Jerusalem’) in\nMuharram 794/December 1391, and was buried near his\nteacher in the enclosure of the Bistamiyya Siifis in the Mamilla\nCemetery.° A son, ‘Abd al-Hadi, had been born after 779/1377-\n78. ‘His father’s followers gathered around him and he became\ntheir shaykh’, but, having settled in Cairo, he died young in 809/\n1406-7.\n\nDATE\n\nThere is no suggestion that ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Safi had himself\nprovided the community with a regular zawiya before his\ndeath. Mujir al-Din calls him ‘shaykh of the Bistdmiyya ascetics\n(fugara’y,* and names Shaykh ‘Abdallah as the endower (wagqif)\nand, rather vaguely, as the sahib (founder, head?) of the\nBistémiyya Zawiya.? However, it is no surprise to find that the\nDefter no. 522, when it lists the three main sources of income\nof the foundation, gives the donations of three individuals in\nthe following years, 774/1372-73, 776/1374-75 and 792/1390,!°\nall dates before the death of Shaykh ‘Abdallah. One might\nexpect to find a Saff shaykh in a position to attract funding,\nrather than to provide it.\n\nThe Haram documents offer evidence that the zawiya\nexisted before the death of Shaykh ‘Abdallah. Document no. 84\nrecords the effects of a Turkish woman, living in religious\nretreat (mujawira) — and probably mortally ill — in the Quarter\nof the Easterners ‘near the zawiya of my lord the Shaykh\n‘Abdallah al-Bistami (may God make his saintly life benefit all)’.\nThis was written in Dhi’l-Qa‘da 793/October 1391, that is, after\nall the endowments mentioned above and only a little before\nthe Shaykh’s death. It cannot tell us in what form the zawiya\nexisted. However, Mujir al-Din says that it was in existence\nbefore 770/1368-69.\"!\n\nENDOWMENT\n\nThe three endowments mentioned above are listed in the\nDefters nos. 522 and 602.\'* They were three plantations outside\nJerusalem, in the case of the last two, with the buildings (buyzit)\nerected on them included. One was in the Biqa‘ land,\'? the\nendowment of al-Hajj ‘Umar b. ‘Abdallah al-Hadi in 774/1372-\n73, another, the location of which was not specified,’* was\ndonated to the zawiya by Muhammad b. Isma‘il, the Nagib, in\n 776/1374-75, and the third was ‘in the Bani Sa‘d Quarter’ and\nwas the waqf of Muqbil al-Tawashi in 792/1390.\'> This financial\nsupport from the two persons of the ‘Mamlik’ class, along with,\nas it appears, one Glim figure, may be compared with the\nendowment of the Qiramiyya Zawiya by an amir from Gaza (see\np. 476).\n\nIt is also recorded, but without any details, that a house in\nthe Zahiriyya Hill Street in Jerusalem belonged to the waaf of\nthe zawiya, as did a parcel of land near Ramla. The income from\nthe latter is given as 1,456 aspers.\'°\n\nA Haram document, no. 538, dated 793/1391, records the\ndeath of a man ‘in a house belonging to the waqf of the\nBistamiyya on the Mawla Steps (Darajat al-Mawla)’. This house\nis not mentioned among the assets of the zawiya in the Defter.\nA further document, no. 461, speaks of a woman from Ayntab\n‘residing in the Easterners’ Quarter in the house which is the\nwadf of our late Lord, the Shaykh ‘Abdallah al-Bistami.’ Note the\n‘late’ — the date of the document is 21 Jumada II 796/23 April\n1394.\"” Does this mean a house endowed by or on the shaykh?\nProbably the former, which may to some extent support Mujir\nal-Din’s description of ‘Abdallah as the waif of the zawiya, if\nindeed the zawiya was the beneficiary.\n\nSUBSEQUENT HISTORY\n\nOne later shaykh of the zawiya is mentioned by Mujir al-Din, a\n\ncertain Shihab al-Din Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Kurdi, who died\n\nin 881/1476-77. He was a Shafi‘T and also held positions in the\n\nmadrasa and the khangah of Saladin, \'8\nIn 964/1556 the then administrator of the waqf reported\n that the roofs of the zawiya were in need of repair. The\nestimated cost was 2,000 aspers.’? Later, in 1018/1609, the\ninspector of the zawiya again listed repairs that were required\nat an estimated cost of 3,300 paras. Features expressly\nmentioned were ‘two rooms (baytayn) on the west side’, ‘an\nupper chamber (hujra)’, ‘three windows (sing. taqa) in need of\nwooden shutters (abwab)’.?°\n\nMODERN HISTORY ;\n\nBy 1927 the place had become ‘very much neglected’ even\nthough the then guardian, Shaykh Misa al-Ghusayn, lived with\nhis family above the zawiya.

As we have already\n not given, but two others named received one asper daily and\nthe fourth person, called administrator (sic) and bawwab,\nreceived two aspers each day.\n\nMODERN HISTORY\nThe modern history of the madrasa is not well documented. In\nthe caption to a photograph taken in 1854 of the facade of the\nLu\'lu’iyya (plate 40.1) Auguste Salzmann called it ‘?Auberge\nd’Allemagne’, without further details.’ Nowadays the deep\nvaults to the south of the madrasa are in use as a haberdashery\nshop and store. The madrasa, when we first surveyed it in the\nsummer of 1982, was littered with piles of debris (see plate\n40.7) and in the absence of an adequate drainage system a\nmakeshift dam across the west iwvdn retained (more or less) the\nviscid noisome contents of a cesspool fed by a latrine on the\nupper floor. Early in 1983 a new drain was installed, the floor of\nthe madrasa cleared, blocked openings re-opened and walls\nand vaults cement-rendered under the supervision of the\nAwqaf Administration’s Department of Islamic Archaeology.\nFollowing this work we were able to extend our survey to\ninclude previously inaccessible areas.\n\nThe upper floor is now used as a dwelling by members of\nthe Asmar family.\n\nIV ARCHITECTURE\n\nTHE MADRASA\n\n(t) Masonry and stonework\n\nThe first indication that an earlier structure once occupied the\nsite on which the Lu’lu’iyya now stands is to be found in the\nlarge, roughly dressed masonry that forms the lowest three\ncourses of the facade (fig. 40.6, plate 40.2). Although the\npresence of a different type of masonry in the lowest courses\ndoes not necessarily denote the remains of an earlier building\n THE MADRASA\n\n() Masonry and stonework\n\nThe first indication that an earlier structure once occupied the\nsite on which the Lu’lu’iyya now stands is to be found in the\nlarge, roughly dressed masonry that forms the lowest three\ncourses of the facade (fig. 40.6, plate 40.2). Although the\npresence of a different type of masonry in the lowest courses\ndoes not necessarily denote the remains of an earlier building\n(above, p. 439), there is reason to think that it does so here. The\neast wall which forms the street facade is unusually thick\n(1.54m) and its thickness seems to have been determined by\nthe previous existence of the three lowest courses; while\nconstruction of both the main entrance and the door to the\nsouthern vaults has clearly involved breaking through these\nlowest courses (plate 40.3). What that earlier structure might\nhave been is not known, though its eastern boundary appears\nto coincide with that of the present construction.\n\nAbove the earlier masonry the facade is composed of\nmuch smaller stones. The dressing of these stones is very\ndistinctive, each one having one or occasionally two panels of\npicked rustication bordered by a plain marginal draft (plate\n40.3). Around the window and door openings the masonry is\ndressed smoothly, which suggests either that the rusticated\nstones are in secondary use and the masons cut only the more\nelaborately shaped stones around the Openings or,\nalternatively, that the rusticated stones were dressed by one\ngroup of masons and the smooth stones around openings by\nanother. Similarly rusticated masonry found only 100m from\nthe Lu’lu’iyya in the chevet of a partly rebuilt church (plate\n40.4), possibly the twelfth-century Church of StJulian, confirms\nthat the rusticated masonry may be in secondary use. The same\nsort of rusticated masonry in the north wall of the nearly\ncontemporaneous Hanbaliyya Madrasa (781/1380) is used\nabove two courses of much larger stones, as at the Lu\'lu’iyya.\n\nA few odd pieces of this masonry are found in the interior\nof the Lu’lu’iyya in places that were originally plastered over.\nThis does not mean to say that there was a surplus of stones\navailable for re-use. Damaged or otherwise unsuitable stones,\neither newly-cut or re-used, could well have been deemed\ninappropriate for use on the facade and relegated to the\ngeneral construction of interior walls and vaults, There are,\nhowever, several stones without the distinctive rustication in\nthe upper part of the facade, which Suggests that the stones\n\nwere being re-used and that the supply had been exhausted by\nthat stage,!°\n Se alata ne cin tees Ee rahe ooh age eh tonne hem) fe meds\npoor quality masonry. This generally consists of roughly\nsquared stones laid in regular courses, originally all covered\nwith a coat of plaster. Openings are spanned by simple arches\nof crude workmanship or by thin lintels, most of which have\ncracked. Yet in places where the stonework was not plastered\nit is of a high quality. The quoins and frontal arches of the four\niwans are of well-cut ashlars as are two doorways in the passage\nbehind the south Zvdaz (below, p. 428). These doorways have\nflat, undercut relieving arches over their lintels similar to those\nover the windows in the facade.\n\n(ii) Compostion of the Facade (fig. 40.6, plates 40.2, 40.3 and\n40.5).\n\nThe tall and extensive street facade is imposing despite the\nsimplicity of its decoration and its partial obstruction by\nstrainer arches built in 1976 to resist an alarming outward lean\nthat the facade had developed, possibly as a result of the 1927\nearthquake. A continuous quirked ogee moulding separates\nthe ground floor from the upper floor. This moulding provides\na clue to the extent of the complex. At the north (right-hand)\nend of the facade it returns (plate 40.6) to include a small room\nspanning the street (marked ‘A’ on the upper floor plan, fig.\n40.5). At the south end it runs across the entrance to the vaults\nsouth of the madrasa and continues half-way across a buttress-\nlike tower built into the re-entrant angle of the street corner. A\nsimpler cavetto moulding forms a cornice over the upper\nstorey. This too extends half-way across the tower at the south\n\nMeith, east tae\n\n end but is now missing from the north end of the facade.\n\nThe composition of the facade is asymmetrical. At the left\n(south) end, adjacent to the corner tower, a doorway\nsurmounted by a window opens into the southern vaults. This\ndoorway has been altered relatively recently; its original form\nmay be seen in a photograph taken by Creswell in 1920 (plate\n40.3). Next is the main feature of the facade: the entrance portal.\nIt is a simple pointed-arched recess decorated with re-used\nmarble imposts (see above, p. 95) and a splay-face moulding\naround the extrados of the red and cream-coloured ablaq\nvoussoirs. At the rear of the recess the doorway, also built in\nablaq masonry, is surmounted in the tympanum of the arch by\na rectangular grilled window lighting a vestibule. Beyond the\nportal are two windows at different levels opening into the east\ntwan of the madrasa; the higher of these is now obstructed by\none of the modern arches. There is a third window, which\nOpens into a room in the north-east corner of the site.\n\nAbove the quirked ogee moulding the fenestration (plate\n40.5) reflects the disposition and importance of the first floor\nrooms. Above the portal and the door to the left are two pairs\nof rectangular mullioned windows each surmounted by a\ncircular oculus and, above that, a slit window (one of which is\nnow blocked); these all light an important reception hall that\nonce enjoyed a fine view to the east (plate 40.19). To the right\nare two single rectangular windows of diminishing size lighting\nrooms ‘B’ and ‘C’ (fig. 40.5).\n\n(iii) Ground floor\n\nThe modest pointed-arched entrance leads into a cross-vaulted\nvestibule. On the right (north) side of this there is a plain door\nleading into the east zwén of the madrasa, which comprised a\ncentral courtyard roofed by a folded cross-vault with an\noctagonal oculus at the crown. The west, north and east sides of\nthe courtyard are confronted by deep Zwdmns, but on the south\nside there is only a shallow recess, with no mibrab but a\ndoorway in the centre (plate 40.7). This door, as will appear\nfrom its description given below, was evidently the main\nentrance to the madrasa, rather than the door entering the east\niwan from the vestibule. Irregularly-shaped chambers fill the\nnorth-east and north-west corners between the other zwdmns.\n\nTo enter a madrasa through the gibla wall, dispensing with\na mibrab, was quite out of the ordinary, and is hard to explain\nexcept by exigencies of the site and the necessity of adapting\nthe accommodation to pre-existing structures. The gibla iwan,\nusually the deepest but here used simply for an entrance, was\ntoo shallow for assembly for tuition or prayers. Teaching must\nhave been conducted in one or more of the other three zwans.\n This can never have been very satisfactory since the whole\nmadrasa was lit and ventilated only by the roof light over the\ncentral courtyard and windows in the eastern 7wan. That iwan\nwas lit, before 1976, by two windows set at different levels in the\neast wall, the higher central, the lower toward the right (plate\n40.8). To the left, where for symmetry a third window might\nhave been expected, there is only a deep niche. If that was once\na window no trace of it remains in the outer face of the wall.\n\nReturning now to the vestibule we may explore the\nstructures which, on the south and west sides, restricted the\narea available to the planners of the madrasa.\n\nFacing the outer portal, the west wall of the vestibule has\nbeen radically altered in modern times. The present doorway\non the west side (plate 40.9) gives access through a short\npassage into a staircase leading up to the first floor. The\ndoorway is not original. The original doorway was in the right\nhalf of the wall, and its lintel is still in position. Except for a\nsmall window-like aperture, that has now been blocked up. It\ngave access to a barrel-vaulted passage along the south wall of\nthe madrasa. Half-way along the passage, on the right side, is the\nwell-built doorway (plate 40.10) which leads into the south\niwan of the madrasa. The carefully dressed and jointed jambs\nand lintel of this doorway (surmounted by a joggled keystone\nbetween two cantilever stones relieving the lintel) and the\ncavetto mouldings on either side show that it belongs to the\noriginal construction and was in fact the main entrance to the\nmadrasa.\n\n——\n The far end of the passage is partly obstructed by an\nobtrusive rubble shaft (plate 40.11) which connects an\nunderlying cistern to a well-head in the upper floor. The shaft\nis obviously a later insertion, possibly replacing an original\nwell-head at this level. Beyond it a doorway, (plate 40.11, fig.\n40.7) constructed of ashlar masonry with a flat relieving arch\nover the lintel like the main entrance to the madrasa, leads into\na vaulted chamber (now largely filled with debris) and on to an\nirregular arrangement of vaults and arches (plate 40.12). These\nappear to belong to an earlier structure. They extend along the\nwest side of the madrasa past an undecorated doorway into the\nwest iwan and on to a blocked opening which apparently led\nto a second staircase at the north-west corner of the site, giving\naccess to the upper floor. Subsequent alterations made in\nadapting the building to domestic use (see below) have\nobliterated all remains of the staircase, except that the vaulting\nof the passage rises eastwards towards the blocked Opening as\nif to roof such a staircase (plate 40.13) and the vaulting of the\nnorth-west corner room has been kept low as if to carry it. A\nstaircase in this position would have supplemented the main\nStaircase from the vestibule, permitting direct access from the\nmadrasa to the upper floor through the doorway in the west\niwan. In this way students could come and go between the\nschool and their lodgings on the upper floor, while the founder\nreached his private apartments by the main staircase.\n\n(wv) Mezzanine (fig. 40.4)\n\nThat main staircase serving the upper floor was formerly\nentered by an opening (which no longer exists) close to the\nnear (east) end of the passage, where its position is indicated by\na small transverse excision in the barrel vault over the bottom\nStair. It lay conveniently close to the main doorway into the\nmadrasa.\n\nThe staircase led up to a large landing now roofed with\nsteel beams and concrete — a late-nineteenth or twentieth-\ncentury technique.’ Presumably it was originally vaulted,\nthough the floor-to-floor height between the landing and the\ncourtyard above is only about 2.5m —a very shallow space in\nwhich to construct a traditional vault to span the 2.93 x 2.91m\nlanding.\n\nA simple doorway leads off the landing into a cross-vaulted\nchamber to the west. This chamber is said by local inhabitants\nto contain a tomb, but when the debris that filled it was cleared\nout in May 1983 no trace of a tomb was found.\n\nTo the east of the landing a very low and narrow L-shaped\nroom sits over the passageway below (shown in section, fig.\n40.7). The entrance to this room was presumably off the\n landing although there is no sign of a doorway there. Until it\nwas blocked in 1983 that room could be entered through a\nhigh-level opening in the rear wall of the gibla twain (see plate\n40.7). There was also a tiny window opening just under the\nvault of the vestibule (plate 40.9).\n\n(v) Upper floor (fig. 40.5)\n\nFrom the mezzanine landing a flight of eleven steps leads\nnorthwards to the main upper floor. Of the original\naccommodation on this level only the eastern range\noverlooking the street survives intact. The rooms on the north,\nwest and south sides all appear to have been rebuilt, though\ntheir arrangement around an open courtyard probably follows\nthe original layout. The octagonal oculus of the madrasa opens\nin an irregular masonry plinth (see figs. 40.5, 40.7 and 40.8) on\nthe east side of the courtyard, which is now filled with a jumble\nof concrete-block walls and shacks (plate 40.14).\n\nAt the north side of the courtyard there is nothing but the\nremains of the springing of a vault in the north-east corner to\nestablish the former existence of structures there.\n\nOf the rooms on the west side only the two southern ones\nappear possibly to be more or less original; the others have\nbeen largely rebuilt. The entrance to the southernmost room is\nsituated, like that of the western room of the south range, over\nthe staircase landing. The staircase itself arrives at the upper\ncourtyard beside the doorway of the central room on the west\nside. This room is now divided to form latrines and a corridor\nleading to a western courtyard surrounded by a further group\nof rooms, not included in the survey. The western courtyard\nand its associated rooms lie beyond the west boundary of the\nmadrasa on the ground floor but it is possible that they once\nserved as ancillary accommodation for the madrasa. They can\nbe reached now only by way of the main staircase. The\narchitectural style of these buildings is Ottoman but here too\nthere are signs of considerable rebuilding. In this western\ncourtyard there is another well-head, formed from a hollowed-\nout column base (plate 40.15), over a second cistern located\njust north of the deepest of the ‘southern vaults’.\n\nOn the south side of the principal courtyard there are two\ncross-vaulted chambers. The eastern one originally opened on\nthe courtyard as an iwéin. The springer and two voussoirs of the\nfrontal arch survive, along with traces of a splay-face moulding\naround its extrados at the south-east corner of the courtyard\n(plate 40.16). Atsome time the arch collapsed and was replaced\nby a new wall, the upper part of which is formed in concrete.\n REINER SLE eee ne nee ey UN LES WOE Ullal POLIS tWarienasea\nnarrow flight of steps cut into its north wall to give access to the\nroof. The lowest steps are missing, as are others higher up\nwhere a new window has been opened (p/ate 40.17),\n\nThe east range consists of three handsome rooms and the\nsmall chamber (A) spanning the street. Whatever the Original\npurpose of this small chamber over the street was, it now serves\nas a bathroom. Windows with low sills in both north and south\nwalls (seen in section, fig. 40.6) allow full advantage to be taken\nof the lively views up and down the street, perhaps originally\nfrom behind mashrabiyya screens. Access to it is from the north\nroom of the east range. Built into the north wall of this room\nthere is a re-used stone decorated with a scallop shell motif\n(plate 40.18) reminiscent of the tiny squinches often used in\nAyyubid dome construction but here carved on a flat surface\nwith a ‘broken arch’ frame of the type often found in the rear\nwalls of water fountains. Its original purpose is unknown.\n\nThe central room of the east range, entered from the\noculus plinth, is set back from the line of the other rooms to\nallow clearance for the folded cross-vault of the madrasa, which\nrises higher than the other vaults. Its floor is at the same level\nas the others in the east range, requiring three steps down to it\nfrom the plinth. There is a door in the south-west corner,\nplaced so as to open on the centre of the adjoining room to the\nsouth. This latter room comprised two cross-vaulted bays each\nlit by a double window with central mullion. It was entered\nfrom the courtyard by a door on the axis of the northern bay;\nand the door (mentioned above) in the centre of the north wall\ngave access to the adjoining room. A modern partition now\ndivides the two halves of the room and has necessitated the\nopening of a new doorway to connect the southern half to the\ncourtyard.\n\nBy analogy with other roughly contemporaneous Mamlik\nfoundations like the Manjakiyya (above, pp. 384-398) and the\nTashtamuriyya (below, pp. 460-474) it seems likely that this east\nrange of rooms served as the residence of the founder, the\nAmir Lu’lu’ Ghazi. The double-bayed room with its anteroom\nto the north and its fine view of the Dome of the Rock (plate\n40.19) would have been an appropriate place for him to receive\nhis guests. As for the rest of the upper floor, it is now too much\naltered for it to be possible to deduce how it might have been\nused originally, whether for accommodating students and\nteachers attached to the madrasa or as part of the founder’s\nresidence or as a combination of hoth\n SOUTHERN VAULTS (Jig. 40.5)\n\n(i) Street vaults\n\nThe main series of vaults to the south of the madrasa extends\n25.5m westwards exactly on the alignment of the present street\nwhich leads eastwards from them to join the valley street, Tariq\nal-Wad, opposite the west entrance to the Siiq al-Qattanin (see\nlocation plan, fig. 40.1). At the west end of the last vault there is\nwhat appears to be an arched opening, now blocked ( plate\n40.20). If this series of vaults were to continue for a further 26m\nwestwards it would open into the Siig al-Khawajat, one of the\nparallel triple markets.’* It is conceivable therefore that these\nvaults are built on the line of some much earlier street whose\nexistence can be detected only in their alignment. Nothing can\nbe deduced from their construction since all are plastered.\n(ii) Vaulted chambers to the south\n\nA further two vaulted chambers to the south are entered from\n the first of the street vaults (plate 40.21). Both are solidly built\nwith squared masonry walls and rubble cross vaults; an ashlar\ntransverse arch separates the two vaults. Cutting across the\nnorth end of the more easterly of these chambers is a staircase\nleading up from the street to various dwellings to the south and\nwest of the Lu’lu’iyya, built partly over the ‘street vaults’. This\nstaircase was obviously built after the vault it cuts through. It\nwas probably built after the Lu’\'lu’iyya also, for at the upper level\nit runs against the wall of the room (D) in the upper floor of the\nmadrasa (plan, fig. 40.5).\n\nThe part these southern vaults played in the running of the\n baralietihe ffm re yet\n\n1 Mujfr, ii, 46-7.\n\n2 CIA (Ville), no. 42.\n\n3 Mujir, ii, 47.\n\n4 Defter 522 = Ipsirli, 36; Defter 602, 457.\n\n5 Mujir, loc. cit.\n\n6 Haram no. 162, dated Ramadan 795/July 1393, contains the testimony of a\nwoman from ‘Ajliin taken in the rab‘ of Lu’lu’, and Haram no. 747, dated Dht\'l-\nHijja 796/October 1394, has the testimony of a woman from Hama.\n\n7 Sijill 4, no. 4326.\n\n8 Sijill 92, 350 (1).\n\n9 Sijill 151, 368.\n\n10 Sijill 57, 349 (2).\n\n11 Sijill 57, 464 (8). ee\n\n12 To be precise, the phrase ‘their ancestor’ appears only in the authorisation to\nact as agent (tawkil), see note 10 above, where it may possibly be an error.

Ibn\nTaghribirdi suggests that he was above all interested in\nmaintaining his own position. However, he does quote a saying\nof Manklibugha’s, that no amir is a true amir unless the expense\nof his common table is half his fief income, and that after having\ndescribed him as ‘generous and perfect in chivalry’. A month or so after returning for the second time to the\npost of governor in Aleppo he died (Jumada II 782/September\n1380).\'° There is broad agreement in the sources concerning\nthis. Ibn Taghribirdi, with some precision as regards location,\nadds that he was buried there too.\'4 Van Berchem complicates\nthe matter quite unnecessarily by understanding that Mujir al-\nDin was referring to the mausoleum in Jerusalem, when he\nwrote that Manklibugha ‘died, and was buried in it.’ Ifin the text\nof the inscription, ‘He died there (lit. in it)’, the pronoun can\nrefer to ‘the province of Aleppo (al-mamlaka al-Halabiyya),,\nwhy is it any more difficult for the pronoun in Mujir al-Din’s\ntext to refer to Aleppo (Halab)? Mujir al-Din would then be\nquite happily in conformity with the inscription and the extra\ninformation in Ibn Taghribirdi. What is more, the historian Ibn\nKhatib al-Nasiriyya, who as a youngster had seen Manklibugha\nin Aleppo, also witnessed his funeral cortége there, and adds,\n‘He was buried in a small tomb chamber (turba) of his outside\nthe Bab al-Maqam, near the Jawhari. After a good many years I\nheard that he was disinterred and taken to Damascus (God\nAlmighty have mercy on him)’. All van Berchem’s difficulties\nstemmed from his belief, for which he produced no evidence,\nthat Manklibugha was actually buried in Jerusalem. In the light\nof the literary evidence, one must doubt whether. the\nanepigraphic cenotaph in a room of the Baladiyya marks the\ngrave of Manklibugha.\'° What one should be noting is the\nsetting-up of an inscription on a building, proclaiming it the\nmausoleum of a person who seems to have been buried\nelsewhere.','','','ALAEINE LEI OLE LOA\nIn a short notice Mujir al-Din places the Baladiyya Madrasa ‘at\nthe Bab al-Sakina near the Bab al-Silsila (the Chain Gate)’,/ and\nal-Suyati has the following passing mention:\n\n... the Bab al-Sakina, which is the gate adjacent to the door\nof the madrasa known as the Baladiyya, the latter now\nhaving the Ashrafiyya Madrasa as its northern (ic)\nneighbour.®\n\nAn inscription which is sited over a small doorway near the Bab\nal-Sakina gives positive identification. This inscription refers\nonly to a mausoleum (turba), but the ample remains of the\ncruciform complex with a large open courtyard more than\nexplain the frequent appellation ‘madrasa’.\n\nIn a sijill entry dated 953/1547 the Baladiyya mausoleum\nappears as the north boundary of the residence over the twin\ngates of the Haram, and access to the house was said to be ‘via\nthe Baladiyya Madrasa (sic)’.\n\nDATE\n\nNo literary or archival source known to us preserves either the\ndate of the construction or the date of the endowment. The text\nof the funerary inscription is as follows.’\n\nIn the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate. This\nis the mausoleum of his late Excellency, Sayf al-Din\nManklibugha al-Ahmadi, Governor of the Province of\nAleppo (may God Almighty encompass him with His\nmercy). He died there in Jumada II of the year seven\nhundred and eighty-two [September 1380]\n\nThis tells us little, especially as there seems to be some\ndoubt about where he was actually buried. The inscription\ncould have been added toa building built well before his death\nor added to one only completed after his death. One may\nspeculate that he embarked upon the Baladiyya when for a\nshort while in late 780/early 1379 he found himself in\nDamascus with bartal status.\n\nFOUNDER\nManklibugha was born in the early 740s/c.1340.° His initial\nmamluk career was passed in Cairo. Ibn Taghribirdi writes of\n‘several positions in Egypt’, but only that of intendant of the\nButtery is expressly mentioned, which he lost in 774/1372\nwhen he was advanced to the highest rank of amir.!° During the\nfollowing years his career kept him in the Syrian provinces.\nThere are discrepancies in the recorded dating and course of\nhis frequent changes of governorship. He held posts in Kerak,\nHama, Safad, twice — possibly three times — in Tripoli, and twice\nin Aleppo. Another Manklibugha, a mamlik of al-Nasir Hasan,\nwho served as governor in Aleppo and Damascus, built a\nmosque in the former and died in 774/1 372, has been confused\nwith the founder of the Baladiyya, but he was called al-Shamsi.!!\nOur Manklibugha in the extant inscription is called al-Ahmadi.\nNo explanation for this misba is given anywhere. The literary\nsources as often as not call him al-Baladi, from which derives\nthe name of his foundation. Since some importation of\nmamluks in the mid-fourteenth century was associated with\nmerchants from Mosul, could it be that the nisba al-Baladi\nrecords his own or his importer’s connection with Balad in the\nMosul area?\n\nIbn Taghribirdi speaks of him as ‘one of the grand amirs,\nwhose days were long in Prosperity’, but, even though many of\n his changes of office and his one or two periods of\nimprisonment were a reflection of the shifting patterns of\npower and influence in the capital, connected with the fall of al-\nAshraf Sha‘ban and the rise to power of Barquq, he seems to\nhave been a compliant member of the hierarchy. Ibn\nTaghribirdi suggests that he was above all interested in\nmaintaining his own position. However, he does quote a saying\nof Manklibugha’s, that no amir is a true amir unless the expense\nof his common table is half his fief income, and that after having\ndescribed him as ‘generous and perfect in chivalry’.\n\nA month or so after returning for the second time to the\npost of governor in Aleppo he died (Jumada II 782/September\n1380).\'° There is broad agreement in the sources concerning\nthis. Ibn Taghribirdi, with some precision as regards location,\nadds that he was buried there too.\'4 Van Berchem complicates\nthe matter quite unnecessarily by understanding that Mujir al-\nDin was referring to the mausoleum in Jerusalem, when he\nwrote that Manklibugha ‘died, and was buried in it.’ Ifin the text\nof the inscription, ‘He died there (lit. in it)’, the pronoun can\nrefer to ‘the province of Aleppo (al-mamlaka al-Halabiyya),,\nwhy is it any more difficult for the pronoun in Mujir al-Din’s\ntext to refer to Aleppo (Halab)? Mujir al-Din would then be\nquite happily in conformity with the inscription and the extra\ninformation in Ibn Taghribirdi. What is more, the historian Ibn\nKhatib al-Nasiriyya, who as a youngster had seen Manklibugha\nin Aleppo, also witnessed his funeral cortége there, and adds,\n‘He was buried in a small tomb chamber (turba) of his outside\nthe Bab al-Maqam, near the Jawhari. After a good many years I\nheard that he was disinterred and taken to Damascus (God\nAlmighty have mercy on him)’. All van Berchem’s difficulties\nstemmed from his belief, for which he produced no evidence,\nthat Manklibugha was actually buried in Jerusalem. In the light\nof the literary evidence, one must doubt whether. the\nanepigraphic cenotaph in a room of the Baladiyya marks the\ngrave of Manklibugha.\'° What one should be noting is the\nsetting-up of an inscription on a building, proclaiming it the\nmausoleum of a person who seems to have been buried\nelsewhere.\n\nSUBSEQUENT HISTORY\n\nIn a chamber on the east side of the Baladiyya, which would\nhave originally looked: out on to the Haram before the\nconstruction of the Ashrafiyya, are buried three members of\none family, the Amir Qunugbay al-Ahmadi and two daughters.\nThe surviving inscriptions date their deaths to Dhit’l-Hijja 797/\nOctober 1395.\'7 One wonders in passing whether it is purely\nfortuitous that this amir has the same nisba as Manklibugha.\n\nMujir al-Din mentions a mysterious incident, quite\nwithout sufficient explanation, in which a Hanafi Qadi of\nJerusalem at the very end of the fourteenth century died along\nwith another person, after they had been given poisoned drinks\nin the Baladiyya Madrasa.!®\n\nThere is nothing but a fleeting mention of the Baladiyya in\nDefter no. 522.” Possibly this is owing to the fact that the waqf\nlands were located in Egypt, as Asali discovered from a later\nsijill entry, where according to him land in the village of Kawm\nal-Tujjar and the whole village of Harasta are named as\nendowments of the Baladiyya.2°\n\nFor the years 946-47/1539-41 the waqfs of the madrasa\nproduced 3,800 aspers.

Excluded from the waqf were two tabaqas\n(living accommodation) over the madrasa, one of which was\nalready completed and given to his son Muhammad al-Salih as\nhis own property, and the other yet to be built and given to his\nother son, Yusuf.” It is interesting that the Shaykh stipulated\nthat ‘any of the benefactor’s daughters or the daughters of any\nof the beneficiaries of the waqf, who may be widowed and in\nneed of accommodation, may reside in the madrasa in the “free\nspace”.° He himself was buried in the madrasa in 1147/1734.”\n\nIt is easy to understand that the madrasa passed into the\nprivate ownership of al-Khalili’s family, and then into the hands\nof the Tarjuman family, descendants of al-Khalili on the female\nside.

The\ntomb-stone was at some time transferred to the main tomb\nwhich had lost its own inscription. One or two entries in the Jerusalem sijills which refer to\nthe Tashtamuriyya in fact call it a madrasa. In 1020/1611 a\nShaykh Sharaf al-Din Yahya b. Muhammad b. Qadi al-Salt\nconverted several fruit plantations around Jerusalem into wagf\nproperty to provide, among other purposes, a sum of money\nfrom which the joint 2ézir and mutawaili of the Tashtamuriyya\nMadrasa would pay 90 paras a year toa person for supplying the\nfountain at the door of the madrasa with clean water\nthroughout the nine months of the three seasons of spring,\nsummer and autumn, and 45 paras for lighting each night a\nlamp in the vault over the street to the west of the\nTashtamuriyya. The mdzir was to spend 45 paras annually on\nthe provision of oil for the lamp.*° The arrangements for the\nsupply of water suggest that the waqf of the Tashtamuriyya was\nno longer fulfilling one part of the founder’s plan. In the year 1093/1682 a group of men, described as the\nmutawallis of the madrasa, requested permission to carry out\nrepairs which were estimated to cost 159 piastres. The details of\nthe work required by the dilapidated state of the building are\nconfusing, but concern the following features: the east wall of\n the madrasa overlooking the public way leading to the\nMoroccans’ Quarter, the lower great chamber (bayt) next to the\neast wall, the upper kitchen of the madrasa and the adjoining\nroom and latrine, the western wall of the madrasa, which\nseparates it from a house in private hands, the ‘upper small\nzwan of the madrasa’, and the portico over the street. In\ngeneral, most of the rooms and the walls needed repair, as did\n‘the rooms attached to the madrasa’.*! A survey, dating from the end of the sixteenth century, of\noffices and positions in the various institutions of Jerusalem,\ntogether with the remuneration for each, mentions for the\nTashtamuriyya the combined post of shaykh and nazir, which\ntwo persons held, one receiving 1 asper daily and the other\nasper. Two men shared the farrdsh position, which merited 114\naspers daily, and three Koran readers shared 28 aspers each\nmonth.” Asali has noted the appointment of the four sons of\nMuhammad b. Qadi al-Salt to succeed him as ‘mudarris’ in\n1046/1636-7.° One of them was called Yahya, presumably the\nsame person that made the waqf in 1020/1611 (see above). TV ARCHITRCTIIRG\n ','FOUNDER\nThe historians and chroniclers of the Mamlak period tend to\n refer to Tashtamur al-‘Ala’i as the dawddar, since it was as First\nSecretary of State or Great Dawadar of Sultan Sha‘ban that he\nhad come to exercise considerable influence on government\naffairs. It was for the first time under that sultan, al-Maqrizi\nStates, that dawdddars were given power almost equal to\nviceroys, issuing royal orders without consultation, and he\nrefers expressly to Tashtamur,\'° who held that position for the\nlast six years of Sha‘ban’s rule (Jumada 1 772 to Dhiv’1-Qa‘da 778/\nNovember-December 1370 to March 1377).\'! He was about two\ndecades senior to Sultan Sha‘ban,\'? and his authority is perhaps\nbest reflected in the angry remark reported of the Sultan when,\non the road to Mecca, he was advised by Tashtamur to take\naction in view of the revolt that was on the verge of breaking\nOut: ‘You order me about (tahkum ‘alaiya) in Cairo, and now\nhere too!’ However, Tashtamur did not always have strained\nrelations with the Sultan, for we read that some years earlier (in\n775/1373) Sha‘ban took his ailing mother to the garden\nmansion (manzara) of Tashtamur on Rawda Island, staying\n there two days in company with all the amirs,\'* among them\ncertainly the Grand Amir who was her husband. After the revolt\nthat led to Sultan Sha‘ban’s assassination, Tashtamur took\ncommand, and cancelling the pilgrimage he led the return to\nCairo. Attacked and defeated by the rival party he was briefly\nimprisoned and then removed to Syria but nonetheless given a\nhigh position as governor of the province.’ There he quickly\nbecame leader of the amirs discontented with the new\nsituation, and their pressure contributed to a change in power\nstructure at court. Within halfa year Tashtamur was called back\nto the capital, made Commander General of the Egyptian Army\n(atabak al- asakir),\'° and assigned residence in the palace of\nQawsiin,’” one of the grandest palaces in Mamluk Cairo where\nthe highest-placed amirs tended to reside. He did not last long\nin that privileged position, for under the nominal rule of a\nminor son of Sha‘ban the real power was in the hands of the\namirs Barqiq and Baraka, as Ibn Qadi Shuhba asserts. Thus, for\nexample, his request for the appointment of the learned jurist\nSiraj al-Din al-Bulgini as Chief Qadi was overruled (the\nprevious holder of that post having resigned in disgust over the\namir’s making light of religious affairs).\'? Apparently,\nTashtamur had long-standing good relations with al-Bulgini\nsince the time he was dawdd4r to Sha‘ban, for we read that he\nhad him conduct a scholarly disputation at his house in 776/\n1375.”° It will have been his systematic way of handling things\n that irritated Barqigq, Ibn Taghribirdi judges,”’ which thus\nbrought about his downfall. In the eyes of this historian\nTashtamur was the ideal administrator whose good offices,\nabsence of greed and excellent handling of state affairs had\nbrought stability and prosperity to people’s affairs, until he was\narrested and Barqig and Baraka took over, doing things which\nlastingly undermined the order of the Mamlik state.”* Indeed,\nBarqiq, having married Tashtamur’s daughter, contrived\nintrigues that led to the arrest of Tashtamur in Dhi’l-Hijja 779/\nApril 1378.\n\nAppointed Commander General instead of his father-in-\nlaw, Barqiq embarked on a ruthless policy of favouring\nmamliks of his own Circassian race, and saw to it that\nTashtamur was given no chance of regaining influence on state\naffairs.

He\ndied [and passed] to the mercy of God Almighty on Friday,\n\n2 Sha‘ban in the year 795 [13 June 1393].*?\n\nHis tomb is possibly the one in a corner of the chamber. The\ntomb-stone was at some time transferred to the main tomb\nwhich had lost its own inscription.\n\nOne or two entries in the Jerusalem sijills which refer to\nthe Tashtamuriyya in fact call it a madrasa. In 1020/1611 a\nShaykh Sharaf al-Din Yahya b. Muhammad b. Qadi al-Salt\nconverted several fruit plantations around Jerusalem into wagf\nproperty to provide, among other purposes, a sum of money\nfrom which the joint 2ézir and mutawaili of the Tashtamuriyya\nMadrasa would pay 90 paras a year toa person for supplying the\nfountain at the door of the madrasa with clean water\nthroughout the nine months of the three seasons of spring,\nsummer and autumn, and 45 paras for lighting each night a\nlamp in the vault over the street to the west of the\nTashtamuriyya. The mdzir was to spend 45 paras annually on\nthe provision of oil for the lamp.*° The arrangements for the\nsupply of water suggest that the waqf of the Tashtamuriyya was\nno longer fulfilling one part of the founder’s plan.\n\nIn the year 1093/1682 a group of men, described as the\nmutawallis of the madrasa, requested permission to carry out\nrepairs which were estimated to cost 159 piastres. The details of\nthe work required by the dilapidated state of the building are\nconfusing, but concern the following features: the east wall of\n the madrasa overlooking the public way leading to the\nMoroccans’ Quarter, the lower great chamber (bayt) next to the\neast wall, the upper kitchen of the madrasa and the adjoining\nroom and latrine, the western wall of the madrasa, which\nseparates it from a house in private hands, the ‘upper small\nzwan of the madrasa’, and the portico over the street. In\ngeneral, most of the rooms and the walls needed repair, as did\n‘the rooms attached to the madrasa’.*!\n\nA survey, dating from the end of the sixteenth century, of\noffices and positions in the various institutions of Jerusalem,\ntogether with the remuneration for each, mentions for the\nTashtamuriyya the combined post of shaykh and nazir, which\ntwo persons held, one receiving 1 asper daily and the other\nasper. Two men shared the farrdsh position, which merited 114\naspers daily, and three Koran readers shared 28 aspers each\nmonth.” Asali has noted the appointment of the four sons of\nMuhammad b. Qadi al-Salt to succeed him as ‘mudarris’ in\n1046/1636-7.° One of them was called Yahya, presumably the\nsame person that made the waqf in 1020/1611 (see above).\n\nTV ARCHITRCTIIRG\n ','FOUNDER, SUBSEQUENT HISTORY'),(46,'','','','','SEE SE BAB NAC RE ELEY:\n\nThis zawiya is situated in the quarter of Jerusalem known in the\npast as Marzuban, ‘near the Bath of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir’ and\n‘near the Badriyya Madrasa and the Lulu’iyya’.’ This\ncorresponds to the area east of the central markets at the top of\nthe rise of the Khalidiyya Street.

The last is a later addition, but\nthe other two appear to be more or less original. The one in the\nsouth-east corner rises against the north wall of the Market Hall\nto a landing from which a further two flights rise in opposite\ndirections.

A\npassage between the two northern chambers leads to the\ngallery giving access to the chambers on this side of the Market\nHall. This staircase presumably originally gave access to the\ngallery on the west side of the courtyard.\n\nOnly four of the original cells remain at this level on the\nwest side of the courtyard, toward the south end, and on the\neast side seven remain.

Another entry in the sijills, dated\n985/1578, describes the east boundary of two houses as\n‘formerly the palace (dar) of “the Lady”, and now al- imara al-\namira’.» This expression, which is found in an Ottoman repair\ninscription (plate 48.26) on the south wall of the upper yard, is\nthe normal term in the sijills for Khassaki Sultan’s foundation.\nLiterally it means ‘the flourishing edifice’, or, rather better, ‘the\nImperial Charitable Foundation’, that is, the range of Siaff\nconvent, ‘soup kitchen’, caravanserai and stables, which\ncontinued to function until modern times, although some part\nof the complex at the end of the nineteenth century served as a\nresidence for the Ottoman governor of Jerusalem.!

Originally the vestibule opened north into the zvan\non the south side of the courtyard. The east wall of the\ncourtyard contains a wide doorway in ablaq masonry enclosed\nby a quirked ogee frame moulding (plate 49.6, fig. 49.7). The\ndoor lintel bears a small squared kufic inscription which is hard\nto decipher but may read ‘Muhammad’ or possibly ‘Muhammad\nal-banna’’ (Muhammad the builder) repeated four times. This\nis the only example of squared kufic from the Mamlak period\nin Jerusalem (fig. 49.11). Why this doorway received special\ndecorative emphasis was that it led to the founder’s tomb,\napproached through a narrow antechamber along the north\nside of the tomb chamber. From there a door flanked by two\nwindows led into the chamber itself; these are all now blocked.\n\nThe lofty tomb chamber (fig. 49.8) is about 4.85m square\nand unusually tall in proportion for it measures 6.25m to the\ncornice above the transition zone and 11.94m to the apex of the\ndome. Shallow (0.20m) wall arches on all four sides spring\nfrom corbels decorated with two tiers of muqarnas. Between\nthese arches ‘folded’ pendentives make the transition from\nsquare base to dodecagonal drum (plate 49.7). Originally the\narches and pendentives and at least the upper part of the walls\nwere coated with plaster, as a pre-restoration photograph\nshows (plate 49.8). In the tympanums a fine moulding of two\ninterlacing bands of plaster followed the profile of the arches\nand framed the clerestorey windows under the crown of each\narch. (As noted above, three of these windows were Open and\none, on the north side, was blind.) All this plaster was removed\nin 1935. The windows in the drum are outlined by a delicate\nfillet moulding carved in the stone (plate 49.9). The dome is\nstilted in internal profile (fig. 49.8) and plastered.\n\nUnder the dome a plain cenotaph sits in the centre of the\nchamber. The tomb itself is said to be in a vault under the floor,\nentered from a rebated stone trap door next to the east wall.\n\nMIHRAB (plate 49.10)\n\nThe mibrab occupies the middle of the south-gibla wall of the\ntomb chamber. Much of its original decoration has been lost,\nbut it is possible to reconstruct the design from the surviving\nfeatures with the aid of old photographs. A semicircular niche\nis flanked by two marble columns fitted with matching ‘thick\nleaf’ capitals but different bases. They are undoubtedly of\nCrusader workmanship and, as the partly unfinished surface of\nthe columns indicates, they were meant to be fitted into corner\nangles, just as they have been re-used in this mihrab. The left-\n hand capital has a broken-off leaf into which an iron peg has\nbeen driven, presumably to act as a support for a repair in\nstucco. The bases rest on small plinths faced with red and grey\nstone. A lining of marble strips around the niche, traces of\nwhich are visible in pre-restoration photographs, survives now\nonly at the base where their convex curvature shows that they\nwere cut from columns. Three round-headed arched panels\nare inset into the marble lining at this level. The pointed arch of\nthe mihrab is composed of thin (1-2cm) joggled voussoirs of\nvarious marbles including rare red and green ones. The\nspandrels of the arch are now undecorated but a pre-\nrestoration photograph reveals traces of marble strapwork\nsimilar in design to the spandrels of the entrance portal.\nRemains of copper ties located by marble plugs in the masonry\naround the mibrab and its flanking windows suggest that the\nlower part of the south wall was once entirely lined with marble\npanelling.\n\nThe conch of the mibrab (plate 49.11) is decorated with\ncarved stucco, the oniy one in Jerusalem so treated. A\nsymmetrical arrangement of interlacing foliate tendrils and\n trefoils around a central vase is enclosed by an epigraphic\nborder which has four loops, each containing a trefoil. The\ninscription is the basmala followed by the first part of Koran\nxlviii, 27. A hole in the centre of the loop at the top of the conch,\ntogether with a series of seven overlaps in the stucco, show how\nthe decoration was applied. First the marble lining, including\nthat of the mibrab, was set in plaster and retained by copper\nties. A timber bead was then fixed to separate the marble lining\nfrom the conch, and the conch coated with stucco. While the\nstucco was still wet a curved template (fig. 49.10) was swept in\n(eight) short arcs over the surface to give a reasonably smooth\nfinish. Only then was the design marked out, presumably from\na pattern, and carved. The varying depth of the carving seems to\nindicate that the sweeps of the template produced a somewhat\nuneven surface upon which the stucco carver worked.\n\nWESTERN DEPENDENCIES (plans, figs. 49.3 and 49.4).\n\nThe main entrance vestibule formerly opened directly into the\niwan. Beside that entrance (now blocked) in the south wall of\nthe zwdin there is a second doorway, which leads into two small\nrooms, one (A) reached through the other (B). It is in the south\nwall of room ‘B’ that the present entrance has been opened, and\nroom ‘A’ now houses a latrine. One or possibly both of these\nrooms may originally have contained the facilities necessary to\nsupply water to the drinking fountain (above, p. 507). The only\ncistern seen by us in the building is, however, inconvenientiy\n remote from these rooms for its mouth is at the east end of the\ntomb antechamber. A wide pointed-arched opening (now\nlargely blocked by a thin partition wall) on the west side of the\ncourtyard leads into a cross-vaulted room (C) from which a\nsecond room (D) to the south is reached. Room ‘D’ has a\nwindow in its east wall opening into the zwdn.\n\nA narrow staircase (plate 49.6) rises against the north wall\nof the courtyard to the upper floor where it emerges ona small\nopen yard. The upper corners of the ground floor courtyard are\nspanned by stone slabs (plate 49.12) giving an octagonal shape\nin plan (similar to the courtyard of the Aminiyya: see above p.\n253). The primary reason for this seems to have been to give\naccess, by a short passage, to space above the tomb\nantechamber, enabling that to be used for a long narrow room\nat first floor level. The other corners were built up solid,\napparently to give visual regularity. Two small windows in the\neast and south sides of the octagon (serving to this extent as a\nlight well) gave light respectively to the room over the tomb\nantechamber and to a double-cross-vaulted room over the\nground floor iwdn, which is entered from the yard. This room\nis additionally lit by two windows overlooking the street. The\nroom over the antechamber has windows also in its north and\neast Outside walls, and another, now blocked, which once\nlooked into the tomb chamber. A pair of slit windows, now\nblocked, opened in the outside northern wail of the octagon\n(plate 49.12) and, since that is open to the sky, these seem to be\nsimply ornamental.\n\nThe remaining rooms arranged round the yard (plan, fig.\n49.4) appear to have served as living quarters, presumably for\na functionary attached to the tomb and its associated pious\nfoundation. They include in the north-west corner a small\nlatrine and/or bath-house with a perforated domical vault. A\nstaircase in an arched recess (plate 49.13) against the west wall\nof the yard gives access to the roof.\n IRANIAN INFLUENCE IN THE DECORATION\n\nWhile the concept and construction of Sitt Tunshuq’s palace\nand tomb is typically Mamlik (see above, p. 499), three\nfeatures of the decoration show signs of Iranian influence: the\nband of star pattern inlay bordering the window in the west\nentrance to the palace, the stucco conch of the mibrab, and the\nSquared kufic inscription at the entrance to the tomb\nantechamber. Iranian influences are otherwise virtually\nunknown in the Mamlik architecture of Jerusalem and there\nmust be some reason for it here. Further research is needed to\nestablish Sitt Tunshuq’s origins, but if she were, as van Berchem\nhas suggested, a Muzaffarid princess who fled from Timir’s\nonslaught into southern Iran, then it would be natural for her\nto have some souvenir of her own country incorporated into\nher new buildings in Jerusalem. The actual work was probably\ndone by local craftsmen, however. The squared kufic\ninscription, for instance — the only one from the Mamlak period\nin Jerusalem — is cut in a very strange fashion, as if the mason\nwere unsure of the correct procedure. Moreover, the stucco\nconch of the mibrab is carved rather flat with no punching and\nvery little drilling such as characterized eighth/fourteenth\ncentury Iranian stucco work. (The star pattern inlay at the west\nentrance to the palace would have presented no particular\nproblems to those responsible for the meticulous carving of\nthe typically Damascene panel over the east entrance. )\n ','IDENTIFICATION, TOMB CHAMBER, MIHRAB, WESTERN DEPENDENCIES'),(50,'','','','','According to Mujir al-Din the minaret stood above a mosque\n(masjid) adjoining the south side of the synagogue?’ of the Jews;\nit was renewed (mustajadda) after 800/1397 when charitable\nindividuals got together and collected money to build it and to\nestablish endowments for it\n\nA partial collapse of the adjacent synagogue after a heavy\nrainstorm in 879/1474 gave rise to a prolonged dispute that led\nto the demolition of the synagogue.

We learn that towards the end of the fifteenth century\nthe Subaybiyya was the residence of the Shaykh of the\nQadiriyya order of Sifis, Sharaf al-Din Misa b. Ahmad b.\n‘Abdallah al-Samit al-Hanafi (d. 898/1492), who used to hold\nimpressive dhikr sessions there every Friday eve.2 What\nhappened to the madrasa is not known, but the immediate\nvicinity retained a connection with his descendants. A house\nsold in 963/1566, was described as being ‘in the district (kbutt)\nof the Governor’s House opposite (taba) the Subaybiyya\nMadrasa, the residence of the Shaykh ‘Abd al-Karim [b.] al-\nSamit.” Similarly in 984/1577, in another document of sale, it is\ncalled ‘the residence of the Bani al-Samit’, and its location now\ngiven as ‘in the Bab Hitta district (bara)!\n\nA dispute arose over the propertv which was settled\n amicably in 1093/1682. A certain Jabir Jurayji had taken it over,\nclaiming that it had been made a waqf by an ancestor, called\nBadr al-Din b. al-Shamiyya, although he had no documentary\nevidence. Another ‘Abd al-Karim b. al-Samit, referred to as ‘one\nof the administrators of, and those responsible (mutakallimin)\nfor, the madrasa’, claimed eight years rent, from which we may\nassume that the above property transfers had been subject to a\nrent payable to the madrasa waqf. These arrears Jabir agreed to\npay and also that the family waqf, whose existence he claimed,\nwould pay in future 150 paras annually for the repair and\ngeneral benefit (maslaha) of the madrasa.\"!\n ','IDENTIFICATION, FOUNDER, DATE, ENDOWMENT, SUBSEQUENT HISTORY'),(52,'','','','','Ald MMO LORY\n\nAccording to Mujir al-Din, the minaret of the Salahiyya\nKhanqah was constructed by the late Burhan al-Din b.

As Mujir al-Din has it: ‘The person who\nfirst drew up the ground plan and intended to build it was the\nShaykh of Islam Shams al-Din Muhammad al-Harawi, the\nShaykh of the Salahiyya and the Superintendent of the Two\n Harams, but fate overtook him before he could build it.

Construction had certainly begun.’ The date of\nthe endowment made by ‘Abd al-Basit, who took over the\nbuilding, was the month of Jumada I 834/mid-January to\nFebruary 1431. If we assume that the building was finished by\nthen, that gives a period of about four and a quarter years for its\ncompletion. It is known that ‘Abd al-Basit paid a short visit to\nJerusalem in Dh ’l-Hijja 833/September 1430.\"° Is it possible\nthat this visit was in connection with the completion of the\nbuilding?\n\nFOUNDER\n\nDuring his final illness ‘Abd al-Basit told a friend that he was\nborn ‘in the year 790 [1388] or in the year before’.!!

It seems likely that the link with ‘Abd al-Basit, clearly\nStated in one case, in fact held good for all three, and that we see\npatronage in action. Shams al-Din Muhammad b. al-Khidr b. al-\nMisti (768-841/1367-1438) served for some time in the\n\nRaab ved Pulp ES Susd Laie\n Hadith specialist and devoted the last years of his life to the\nstudy of Hadith in the Basitiyya.” After his death, ‘Abd al-Basit\nreplaced him by the man who had followed him in the\nChancery, Sharaf al-Din Yahya b. Ahmad b. al-‘Attar al-Hamawi\n(787-853/1385-1450).™ After an initial military career, Sharaf al-\nDin had entered the Chancery, acting as secretary for ‘Abd al-\nBasit. He went to Jerusalem to take up the position of shaykh in\nRamadan 841/March 1438, but resigned after a while and\nrequested ‘Abd al-Basit to appoint Taqi al-Din ‘Abdallah b.\nMuhammad b. Isma‘il al-Qalqashandi (783-867/1380-1463),\nwhich he did. Taqi al-Din used to receive a robe of honour\nannually from Sultan Barsbay through the good offices of ‘Abd\nal-Basit, and al-Sakhawi, who met him and was kindly treated by\nhim in Jerusalem, remarks that his position declined after the\ndeath of ‘Abd al-Basit.””\n\nThere is a further suggestion of very personal ‘charity’ at\n‘Abd al-Basit’s institutions since we find in Sakhawi\'s\nbiographical dictionary the following brief entry: ‘Shahin,\nresident in the Basitiyya — I believe him to have been a mamliik\nof the founder . . . He died in Ramadan 895 or 896’2° The\nBasitiyya in question was almost certainly the Cairo foundation.\n\nOTTOMAN PERIOD\n\nAn account for the year 947/1540-417’ reveals that the Basitiyya\nreceived quantities of cereals from the wagf lands at Sar Bahir\nand that these were then converted into cash. The account is in\nlarge deficit for the year. It is also possible to form an idea of the\npersonnel.\n The salaries were as follows: inspector 640; shaykh 650;\nclerk 180; rent collector/water carrier 390. The sums still not\nexpended were for bawwdab 50; imam 20; recitation of Hadith\n20; caretaker and distributor of Koran sections 40; twelve\nreaders of the Koran 270 (11 x 12 and 1 x 50). The mubdshir\n(agent?) received no salary. The expenses included 144 for oil\nfor lighting, 300 for storage of grain. The rest was expended on\nadministration and collection of produce, but it is just possible\nthat 60 of the remainder went to the orphans” stipulated by the\nfounder.\n\nIn the following year, 948/1541-42, an unspecified part of\nthe lands of Str Bahir was leased to an inhabitant of the village\nof Ibn Abi ‘Ubayd (?) for a period of twenty years at an annual\nrent of 65 Aleppo [silver coins].”” That a lease for that period\nwas contrary to the provisions of the waqf is indicated by the\ncomplaint brought forward by the inspector, Shams al-Din\nMuhammad b. Abi ‘I-Lutf al-Shafi,” in Sha‘ban 961July 1554.\nHe produced an authenticated waqf document of the Basitiyya\nKhanqgah to support his claim that no part of the lands should be\nleased for more than one year and that there should be no\nstringing together of nominally separate contracts.\nNevertheless, a lease of some land for twenty years at an annual\nrent of 200 paras beginning from 1 Muharram 968/22\nSeptember 1560, was confirmed by the inspector and\nadministrator, Zayn al-Din Luqman b. Siraj al-Din ‘Umar b.\nAbi’l-Lutf al-Hanafi (sic) in favour of the lessor, an inhabitant of\nSur Bahir.*!\n\nBy 1069/1658-9 some confusion between the Mawsiliyya\nand the Basitiyya, at least in the functioning of their officials,\nseems to have arisen. Shaykh Salih b. ‘Umar b. Abi ‘L-Lutf,\nthe administrator of the Basitiyya and ‘Ali b. ‘Abd al-Haqq b.\nAbi l-Lutf, the administrator and shaykh of the Mawsiliyya,\nacknowledged one another’s undisputed right to the posts.\n Salih had received money for the half post of administrator of\nthe Mawsiliyya and had spent it on that institution, whereas ‘Ali\nhaving received money from Sir Bahir, the waqf of the\nBasitiyya, had handed it to Salih, who himself spent it on the\nBasitiyya. Thus the accounts were acknowledged to be correct.\nThe situation suggests the family dominance of the two\ninstitutions, the inheriting of shares in the controlling offices\nand the rationalising of the divisions of responsibility (and\nremuneration?) to avoid disputes.*”\n HARAM FAGADE (fig. 53.4, plate 53.1)\n\nThe fagade above the Haram portico extends from the\nAminiyya (no. 24) eastwards as far as the portico in front of the\nAwhadiyya (no. 9). The reasons for associating this facade with\nthe Basitiyya and not the Dawadariyya (as van Berchem\nthought) are given on p. 156.\n\nThe design of the facade is notably lacking in cohesion. It\nmay be considered in four sections. The first, at the west end\nnext to the Aminiyya, includes a plain window and the\ndecorated entrance portal; the second, to the east of the first,\nincludes a group of three rectangular grilled windows; the\nthird, a double pointed-arched window; and the fourth, two\nrectangular windows.\n\nA billet moulding runs across the top of the first of these\nsections. A similar billet moulding runs below most of the other\nthree sections to the east. The correlation between the two\nmouldings may reflect the two stages in the sequence of\nconstruction. In other words, the first section of facade,\ncontaining the entrance portal, was the work of Shams al-Din\nal-Harawi, and the remainder, including the billet mouldings,\nwas subsequently completed by ‘Abd al-Basit (see above),\n\nThe entrance portal looks very odd nowadays for there is\nno apparent means of approaching it (see plate 53.2). The top\nof a buttress of the Haram portico has been removed to\naccommodate it. The original staircase rose from beside Bab al-\n‘Atm eastward across the face of the portico: it is shown on the\n1865 Ordnance Survey plan.** The doorway is now blocked. It\nis set in a pointed-arched recess with stone benches on either\nside. The arch appears to have been made from re-used\nmaterial. The hoodmould follows a somewhat erratic profile, as\nif it were made from pieces intended for a larger arch, and its\ncurlicue label stops are quite dissimilar in size. The voussoirs of\nthe arch, carved with mugarnas elements® in a fashion\nreminiscent of Anatolian Saljtiq practice, appear also to be in\nsecondary use. This is particularly apparent in the keystone,\nwhich is simply cut from a voussoir and so its muqarnas\ndecoration is not integrated with that of the adjoining voussoirs\n(plate 53.3). The source of this re-used material is not known.\n\nTo the right (east) of the portal is the group of three grilled\nwindows. The central window is larger than the other two, and\nis surmounted by a blind triple window composed of a pair of\nsmall horseshoe-arched openings with a circular oculus placed\n centrally above them (plate 53.4). The stone mullion between\nthe arched openings of the triple window is decorated with two\nlittle corner columns with anvil-shaped capitals and bases\n(plate 53.4). The two smaller grilled windows have undercut\nrelieving arches above their lintels. This section of the facade is\nbounded to left and right by masonry ‘buttresses’ that rise to the\nfull height of the facade above the billet moulding. Adeep cyma\nrecta moulding with discontinuous down-turns at either end\nconnects the buttresses across the top of the facade (see plate\n53.1). The single course of stones which forms a parapet above\nthe moulding probably belongs to later changes made in the\nthird quarter of the nineteenth century.\n\nMost significant of these changes was the removal of a\ndome above the room lit by the double-arched window. Early\nphotographs”* show the dome still in place. Fig. 53.5 shows the\nrelationship between the dome and the double window, which\nfollows a pattern set first in Jerusalem at the Is‘ardiyya (no. 33)\nand followed at the Manjakiyya (no. 35) and the ‘Uthmaniyya\n(no. 57). The arches are composed of red and white ablaq\nvoussoirs and rest on three re-used marble columns with\nunmatching Crusader capitals and bases (plate 53.5). A circular\noculus in the spandrel between the arches appears to be a later\ninsertion, as does the wide arch above the windows and the\ncornice at the top of the facade (which may have been taken\nfrom the top of the east wall of the Dawadariyya’s courtyard: see\n\nabove, p. 162). These alterations were made presumably at the\ntime of the dome’s removal.\n The first window to the right of the double window has an\nundercut relieving arch above its lintel and, above that, a plain\nslit window. The easternmost window, with red and cream-\ncoloured ablaq jambs set in a shallow recess, also has an\nundercut relieving arch above its lintel. The projecting string-\ncourse cornice across this part of the facade is typically\nnineteenth-century; it presumably belongs to the same\nalterations that affected the rest of the facade.\n\nINTERIOR (plan, fig. 53.3)\n\nThe original extent of the Basitiyya is difficult to determine.\nThere are buildings at upper floor level on all four sides of the\nDawadariyya’s central courtyard. The bulk of them appear by\ndint of their segmental or semicircular window and door\narches to be Ottoman. Only the construction on the roof of the\nHaram portico can be definitely ascribed to the Basitiyya. The\nimplication contained in the Ottoman documents cited above\nthat the Basitiyya was contiguous with the Sallamiyya (no. 25) to\nthe north of the Dawadariyya might be due to some confusion\nat that time between the Dawadariyya and the Basitiyya. At any\nrate, since Mujir al-Din*’ lists the Basitiyya as one of those\nbuildings that could be entered from inside or outside the\nHaram, it may be assumed that its occupants had access to the\nstreet by way of the staircase at the north-east corner of the\nDawadariyya’s courtyard. (The staircase against the south wall\n a ee\n\nof that courtyard appears to be a later — possibly nineteenth-\ncentury — addition.)\n\nThe entrance from the Haram was, as described above,\nreached by way of a flight of steps built against the Haram\nportico. The threshhold of that entrance is 1.70m below the\npresent floor level of the vestibule that it must have given access\nto. This difference in levels would need about seven steps to\naccommodate it. The passage from the entrance to the vestibule\nis now completely blocked. A break 1.13m wide in the masonry\nof the east wall of the vestibule shows where it may have\nemerged, as shown dotted on the plan, fig. 53.3. If it did so, and\nif the present floor level of the vestibule is the same as the\noriginal level, then the restricted space means that the steps\nmust have been mostly winders and the entrance could not\nhave been fitted with a single or even a double door unless the\nsteps continued into the vestibule itself. A possible alternative\nroute for the entrance passage — through a recess 0.69m wide\nand 1.74m high in the south wall of the room marked ‘A’ on the\nplan — seems unlikely for it does not align with the entrance, it\nis too narrow, and it takes no account of the break in the\nmasonry of the east wall of the vestibule.\n\nThe vestibule has a low window opening in an arched\nrecess in its south wall and a much deeper barrel-vaulted recess\nin its north wall. A doorway alongside the latter recess opens\nnorth into room ‘A’, which is roofed by a folded cross vault that\nrises from little mugarnas springers (see plate 53.6). The\n recess in the south wall of this room is alluded to above.\nOpposite it, a door in the north wall (which is the upper part of\nthe Haram wall) opens into sundry structures to the north.\nThese structures, including a stairway leading to a group of\nlater rooms above the vestibule and room ‘A’, appear to be later\naccretions. Originally the door must have led from room ‘A’\ninto an open yard on the roof of the assembly hall and other\nrooms on the south side of the Dawadariyya’s courtyard.\n\nA doorway in the south wall of the yard opens through a\npointed-arched recess into room ‘B’. The arch of the recess\n(plate 53.7) is distinctively decorated with a quadrant chamfer\naround the intrados and a hoodmould around the extrados\nwith short lateral extensions at the level of the springers. A\nmetal ring fitted to the keystone would allow a lamp to be\nsuspended in the doorway. Room ‘B’ overlooks the Haram\nthrough the group of three windows described above. A\npointed-arched recess above the central window may indicate\n that the little triple window in the facade was once open. The\nroom is roofed by a folded cross vault rising from mugarnas\nspringers, similar to those in room ‘A’, to an Octagonal cupola\nat the crown. There are pointed-arched recesses in the east and\nwest walls. A door (now blocked) in the east wall led into the\nadjoining room ‘C’, which enjoys a fine view of the Dome of the\nRock through the doubled-arched window in its south wall. Tall\npointed-arched recesses in all four walls reduce the central\narea of the room to a nearly perfect square in plan. This area\nwas originally covered by a dome as described above; it is now\ncross-vaulted. A door placed off centre in the north wall of the\nroom has no reveals and seems likely to be a later insertion. In\nthat case access to room ‘C’ would have been through room ‘B’.\nA door (now blocked) in the east wall of ‘C’ leads into room ‘D’,\nwhich is roofed by two cross vaults separated by a transverse\narch. The west vault is both narrower and higher than the east\nvault. In the middle of the walls at the south end of each vault\nare windows surmounted by slit windows (the eastern of which\nis now blocked) Opening on the Haram. High-level windows in\nthe east and west walls of the room are blocked. A door in the\nnorth wall has no reveals, Suggesting that it is a later insertion,\n\nin which case access to room ‘D’ must have been only by way of\nrooms ‘B’ and ‘C’,\n 1 Mujir, ii, 39.\n2 Mujir, ii, 112.\n3 Mujir, ii, 39.\n4 Sijill 12, no. 2574.\n5 Sijill 151, 481 (1).\n6 Mujjr, ii, 39.\n7 Daw, viii, 151-5; Sulitk, iv, 732; Nuj., vi, 793.\n8 See Mujir, ii, 112.\n9 Mujjr, ii, 39.\n10 Sultik, iv, 835; Nuzj., vi, 662.\n11 For biographical information, see Manbail, Vienna Ms., fol. 32a; Nay! al-Amal,\nfol. 79a.

In the years 963-64/1555-56 ‘Ali Beg b. Shah\nRukh is mentioned and described as amir liwa’ of Gemigesek.\"”\nNearly twenty years later the overseer is Shah Rukh b.\nMuhammad Khan, another member of the Dhulghadir\ndynasty.\'* The practical job was done by the mudarris. A\ndispute over the headship of the madrasa in 1092/1682\nproduced further evidence of the stipulations of the founder,\nnamely that the madrasa as a whole was restricted to immigrant\nTurks from Anatolia (al-Turk al-afagiya min al-Arwdm), or\nfrom elsewhere, living in Jerusalem, and that residence in the\nmadrasa was laid down for the mudarris and [acting-]\noverseer.\'? These conditions are not mentioned in the text\ntranslated above, but they are implied or paralleled in the\nconditions concerning the bawwdb. Although it is nowhere\nexpressly stated, it seems natural to assume that the madrasa\nwas intended for Hanafis. The affiliation of the known\npersonnel would also strengthen this assumption.”°\n\nFrom amongst the waqfs made initially by Misr Khatain on\nher husband\'s behalf, to my knowledge only the market in\nJerusalem”! receives any mention in the Jerusalem Court\nrecords. In addition to the Aleppo properties, with which Nasir\nal-Din Muhammad endowed the madrasa, income also came\n from a village in the district of Mar‘ash and another in that of\nQal‘at al-Rim. This must have been a yet further endowment\nafter Nasir al-Din’s. For sample accounts during the period 962-\n983/1554-1576, see the separate table (below).\n\nIn Sha‘ban 964/June 1557 a contract for repairs to the\nmadrasa was made. The cost to the waqf was 10 gold pieces. The\nfollowing elements of the madrasa are mentioned: the\nassembly hall, the balustrade (si#tara) opposite the minaret, two\nupper chambers and also an upper house (bayt), the kitchen\nand the bawwab’s house (dar). There is also mention of ‘fitting\nthe lead of the column’ (tarkib rusds al- amid) and ‘building a\nsmall balustrade for the pool (birka), two courses high’.”?\n\nLater, in 984/1576, the mudarris complained that the\nmadrasa was in a ruined state and that the former mudarris had\nnot performed his duties and did not deserve the 32% gold\npieces which were being held for him from the year 981/1573-\n74. The amir liwa’ and the Qadi ordered the sum to be\ndeposited in the Citadel with the Ketkhtda for future\nexpenditure on the madrasa.”* Yet at the end of the eleventh/\nseventeenth century the traveller ‘Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulusi,\nwho visited the madrasa, speaks of it as flourishing.4\n ','IDENTIFICATION, FOUNDER, DATE, ENDOWMENT, OTTOMAN PERIOD'),(55,'On the north side of the Bab al-Nazir Street to the east of the\nRibat of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir may be found a remnant of an\ninscription over a doorway, as follows: ...

When reporting his death,\nMaqrizi writes, ‘He came [to Cairo] from Jerusalem [and held],\nin the reign of al-Nasir Faraj and subsequently, several\ngovernorships, in Gaza, Jerusalem and elsewhere.” Al-Sakhawi\nquotes the information in Maqrizi’s chronicle and adds, ‘I think\nhe was Superintendent in Jerusalem and the founder of the\nmadrasa there which is mentioned by Ibn Ruslan.’ The author\nand the work referred to here are unknown to us.

The mutawalli of the waqf was\nthe Shaykh Ahmad al-Wafa’l in 981/1573, at the time when the\nsipabi of the village of ‘Inab, appearing before a commissioner\nof the Governor ofJerusalem, complained that the villagers had\nsold the olive crop without his knowledge. His timar was one\nthird of the village, plus two thirds of the tithe (1shr). The rest\nwas still waqf for the Hasaniyya.”!

Hasan al-Nasiri al-Hanafi (may God forgive his sins) on\nthe date, Dha’l-Qaf‘da].. .!\n\nThis may well survive from the Hasaniyya Madrasa, which\nMujir al-Din said was situated ‘in the Bab al-Nazir [Street] over\nthe Ribat of ‘Ala’ al-Din al-Basir’.\n\nDATE\n\nAccording to Mujir al-Din, the madrasa was built in 837/1433-34\nand the date of the waqf was 1 Rajab 838/31 January 1435.7 Al-\nSakhawi wrote that the madrasa was built after (8]35/1431-32,\nbut says that it was in the Haram (al-Masjid al-Agsa).° Did he\n\nconfuse this foundation with the earlier Hasaniyya Madrasa,\n\nbuilt by Shahin al-Hasani al-Tawdsbi over the Bab al-Asbat in\n\nthe reign of al-Nasir Hasan, that is, early in the second half of the\nfourteenth century?\n\nFOUNDER\n\nHis full name is given as the Amir Husam al-Din Abi\nMuhammad al-Hasan b. Nasir al-Din Muhammad b. Jamal al-\nDin ‘Abdallah — al-Kashkili al-Hanafi, who served as\nSuperintendent of the Two Harams and as governor of\n Jerusalem? A person called Husdm al-Din Hasan, whom we\nmay identify with the founder, having already been governor of\nGaza, was appointed governor of Kerak in 810/1407.° In 822/\n1419 we find him, during his tenure of the governorate of\nJerusalem, arriving in Cairo with many citizens of Jerusalem\nand Hebron to complain of the peculations of the Qadi al-\nHarawi.’ He was dismissed from his Jerusalem post and\nreplaced by the Amir Nasir al-Din Muhammad b. al-‘Attar al-\nHamawi in 827/1424° If that was his last official position, then\nhe built his madrasa in retirement. When reporting his death,\nMaqrizi writes, ‘He came [to Cairo] from Jerusalem [and held],\nin the reign of al-Nasir Faraj and subsequently, several\ngovernorships, in Gaza, Jerusalem and elsewhere.” Al-Sakhawi\nquotes the information in Maqrizi’s chronicle and adds, ‘I think\nhe was Superintendent in Jerusalem and the founder of the\nmadrasa there which is mentioned by Ibn Ruslan.’ The author\nand the work referred to here are unknown to us.\n\nHusam al-Din al-Hasan died in the year 842, either, as\nMujir al-Din tells us,!\" on 15 Dhi’l-Hijja (29 May 1439) or,\nas Maqrizi maintains,!? on Sunday, 23rd of that month (7 June\n1439). According to the latter, he died in Cairo, but Mujir al-Din\nsays that he died in Jerusalem, and was buried in the Mamilla\nCemetery near the Shaykh Abii ‘Abdallah al-Qurashi.\n\nWAQF\nThe date for the waqfiyya given by Mujir al-Din, 1 Rajab 838/31\nJanuary 1435, is confirmed by the Defter no. 602,” at least as far\nas the year is concerned. Defter no. 522 has the date 938/1531-\n32, but this is surely an error.\'4\n\nBoth defters list the Palestinian properties which supplied\nthe madrasa with its endowment income. In the case of Defter\nno. 602 alone an annual income figure is given for each one:\n Deiter no. 522 contains a précis of the provisions of the\nwagfiyya. The personnel was intended to be as follows, and it\nwill be noted that although the wagfiyya précis refers to a\n Mamilttk Jerusalem\n\n‘madrasa’, as do all other sources, there is no provision for\nstudents of law and one might well have expected the\nfoundation to be called a khanqah or zawiya.\n\n(a) the Shaykh, who was to exercise the leadership in\nprayer (imadma) of the madrasa and, although the text is not\nclear at this point, to give instruction in the Koran. It was his\nduty to attend the Safi office of prayer (wazifa) after regular\nevening prayer with the rest of the inmates. For allowances he\nreceived 1 Jerusalem rotl of bread daily and 1% rotls of olive oil\nmonthly. Ex officio he served as administrator (n@zir) in\ncooperation with the Shaykh of the Salahiyya, and received 100\ndirhams monthly.\n\n(b) There were 10 foreign, ‘wandering’ dervishes (fuqara’\nGfaqiyya), each of whom was to receive 4 rotl of bread and 4\ndirham daily. Later in the précis, however, an extra oke of bread\ndaily and 15 dirhams monthly is specified for each one. The\nsalary of the musaddir, their shaykh, was reduced from 30 to 15\ndirhams each month.\n\n(c) Of the 10 Siifis (szifiyya) on the establishment, each of\nwhom was to receive 2 rotl of bread daily, one was to serve as\nservant (farrash) for 30 dirhams monthly, another as bawwdab\nand a third as teacher of the orphans (fagqih), both for the same\nmonthly emolument.\n\n(d) There were to be 10 Muslim orphans learning to recite\nthe Koran ‘in the domed chamber (qubba) on the south wall’.\nEach was allowed % rotl of bread daily and 7% dirhams\nmonthly.\n\n(e) The control of the waqf finances and the keeping of the\naccounts was to be in the hands of a factor (@mil), and his\nallowance was % rotl of bread each day and 30 dirhams each\nmonth.\n\n(f) The staff included a water-carrier (saqqa’) to supply the\nneeds of the madrasa.\n\nThe founder stipulated that the Shaykh and all the inmates\nand the staff should assemble every Friday morning in the\nmadrasa to recite four stiras of the Koran, no. 18 (the Cave), no.\n36 (Yasin), no. 56 (the Protection), and no. 67 (the\nSovereignty), and then finish with the normal petitioning\nprayers (du @’). The merit of all this was to be dedicated to the\nfounder. Another stipulation was that every day after sunset\nprayer there should be four persons to recite from the Koran\n(buffaz) in the Haram arcade at the Bab al-Nazir. The chief of\nthese should receive 9 dirhams monthly and the other three 7\neach. The readings should be to the merit of the founder, his\nwives and his brother.\n\nAs was normal practice, an order of priority for the\ndisbursement of the income was established, if not all the\ncharitable purposes could be met. On the other hand, any\nexcess of income was to be spent on the distribution in the\nmadrasa of sweetmeats in the months of Rajab and Sha‘ban, and\nof meats and foodstuffs for the feasts at the end of Ramadan and\nat the culmination of the pilgrimage. The residual beneficiaries\nof the waqf were to be the poor and indigent ofJerusalem at the\ndiscretion of the adminstrator.\n\nSUBSEQUENT HISTORY\nAfter the completion of the building, the founder appointed as\nthe shaykh of the madrasa Taqi al-Din Aba Bakr b. Taj al-Din\nMuhammad b. ‘Ali b. Ahmad b. Da’tid b. Abi ‘LWafi’ (b.. 793/\n1391, d. 859/1455), who proceeded to take it as his place of\nresidence.\" His son, Taj al-Din Muhammad b, 841/1437-38, d.\n891/1486) succeeded him in the post of shaykh (see p. 456).}8\nIn 945/1539 the revenues of the lands the wadf held in the\nvillages of ‘Inab and Umm Taba were farmed to Mustafa b. ‘Ali\nthe Janissary (al-Inkishari :), who was a resident of the Jerusalem\nCitadel. He paid 700 aspers as a down Payment and undertook\nto pay the rest, 1,000 aspers, at the end of the year. He was also\nresponsible for the payment of the tithe and what was due to\nthe sultan (al-kbdss).° Another sijill entry, dated 968/1560\nrecords an agreement between the nazir of the Hasaniyya,\nHusam al-Din Ya‘qub (who was the nazir also in 945/1539) and\na Yusuf b. ‘Abdallah, acting as agent for the Ketkhuda of\n\n5326\n Jerusalem, that the latter owes 41 dinars for the revenue from\nhalf the village of Dayr Dabwan.”\n\nIt is probably correct to assume a continuing connection\nwith the madrasa on the part of the family which supplied the\nfirst two shaykhs, named above. The mutawalli of the waqf was\nthe Shaykh Ahmad al-Wafa’l in 981/1573, at the time when the\nsipabi of the village of ‘Inab, appearing before a commissioner\nof the Governor ofJerusalem, complained that the villagers had\nsold the olive crop without his knowledge. His timar was one\nthird of the village, plus two thirds of the tithe (1shr). The rest\nwas still waqf for the Hasaniyya.”! Furthermore, Asali quotes\ntwo sijill entries, in one of which ‘Abd al-Qadir b. Musa al-Wafa’\n(sic) replaces his two brothers as holder of one quarter of the\n‘teaching position’ (wazifat al-dars) in 1168/1754-5, and in the\nother a Badr b.

There was also provision\nin the report for the blocking of a door of the upper mosque\nand the opening of a new one, to alter the old door of the\nassembly hall opposite the mosque into a window (tdqa) and to\nopen the old cupboard (khizana) as a door to lighten the arch\n(aqd) (meaning?).\n\nThe reference to a lower mosque and to an upper mosque\nalong with an assembly hall, all of which is reminiscent of the\ndescription of the Tankiziyya, strongly suggests that the\n‘Uthmaniyya too was founded for both the study of law (figh)\nand for Sufi devotions.\n\nAsali is inclined to believe that the ‘Uthmaniyya\nmaintained an active teaching role ‘for four centuries at least’.\nAny decision on that depends on one’s general view of the\nnature of the numerous appointments recorded for this and\nother institutions (see pp. 73-74). One should nevertheless\nremember the mention of nine students early in the\nseventeenth century.

The\nmuezzin’s galleries and their superstructures are virtually\nindentical. This makes it tempting to suppose that the two\nminarets are more or less contemporaneous, but in the\nabsence of more concrete evidence it may be wiser to adopt\nMujir al-Din’s dating ‘before 870’ (1465-66).\n\nIn the Ottoman period the Mosque of al-Afdal ‘Ali became\nassociated with ‘Umar b. al-Khattab and was called Jami‘\n‘Umar’‘ A recently painted sign over the outer entrance calls it\nMasjid “Umar b. al-Khattab.\n ',''),(60,'','','','','An inscription on two marble plaques on the east face of the\narcade records that:\n\n... this blessed stairway was constructed in the reign of...\nal-Malik al-Ashraf . . .

The later entry reports repairs effected by the\nadministrator of the Zamaniyya and the Khatiniyya, ‘Abd al-\nRahman Effendi b. Muhammad b. Muhammad al-‘Afifi al-Hanafi\n(sic)° to both buildings.

To the left (west) of the portal the facade is plain except\nfor a trefoil-headed slit window anda large rectangular window\nat ground floor level, and another rectangular window at upper\nfloor level. To the right of the portal an elaborately decorated\ngrilled window at ground floor level is surmounted by a plain\nwindow at upper floor level (plate 61.2). The juxtaposition of the principal features of the facade —\nthe portal and the decorated window — and the configuration of\nthe quirked ogee moulding that frames them were clearly\ninspired by the facade of the ‘Uthmaniyya on the opposite side\nof the street. In the ‘Uthmaniyya the aim of the designers was to\nrelate a window in the founder’s tomb to the entrance portal\ncontaining the foundation inscription. In the Ribat al-Zamani,\non the other hand, there is no tomb and here the builders must\nsimply have copied what they saw as a successful design. The details of construction are, however, different from those of the ‘Uthmaniyya and bear rather a strong resemblance to those of\nthe Muzhiriyya (no. 62), which was completed in 885/1480-81. The masonry enclosed by the frame moulding is red and\ncream-coloured ablaq. The entrance portal consists of a\nshallow, trefoil-arched recess flanked by the usual stone\nbenches.

Two courses above the lintel a joggled string course (the\nsection above the door was replaced during the post-1914\nrepairs ) extends across the facade within the limits of the frame\nmoulding. The profile of the joggling over the door is different\nfrom that over the window (see plate 61.2). Above the window\nlintel the joggling is specially elaborate.

The extant inscription on the building immediately to the\nright, as one leaves the Haram by the above-mentioned gate,\nprovides positive identification. the inscription uses only the\nneutral description ‘this blessed place’.\n\nDATE\n\nAccording to Mujir al-Din the date of the construction of the\nribat was the year 881/1476-773 This is confirmed by, indeed, it\nmay merely derive from, the inscription,‘ which reads as\nfollows:\nIn the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate. This\nblessed place was erected by the servant needful of God\nAlmighty, the Khwaja Shams al-Din Muhammad b. al-\nZamin, the servitor of the Noble Shrine of the Prophet\n(upon its inmate be the best of blessings and greetings), in\nthe year eight hundred and eighty-one. May God bless our\nLord Muhammad and his family.\n FOUNDER\n\nThe founder named in the above inscription was described by\nMujir al-Din as ‘one of the courtiers (khawéass) of the Sultan al-\nMalik al-Ashraf Qaytbay’. In another source we find him called\nMuhammad b. ‘Umar, commonly known as Ibn al-Zamin, and\ndescribed as ‘the agent (wakil) and merchant (tajir) of the\nsultan’? He makes a few appearances in the chronicles,\nexclusively as a person commissioned by the sultan to carry out\ncertain buildings projects.\n\nIn 878/1473-74 the Sultan Qaytbay was informed of repair\nworks that were needed in the Prophet’s Mosque. Shams al-Din\nMuhammad, who by that date had already built in Medina a\nmadrasa called the Zamaniyya, was entrusted with the task. He\ncame to Medina during 879/1474-75, made the necessary\narrangements and then returned to Egypt. Shams al-Din\nMuhammad was later commissioned to do further work there.\nHe came from Jedda to Medina in Jumada I 881/August-\nSeptember 1476 and stayed to oversee things personally.° This\nwas the year in which own ribat in Jerusalem was completed. In\n882/1477-78 Shams al-Din Muhammad was involved in a\ndisturbing incident in Medina, where he had been asked to\nacquire a site for the construction of a madrasa for Qaytbay. He\nhad taken over the house of a Shi‘ite to incorporate it into the\nnew madrasa. The qadi, who allowed the demolition of the\nhouse, was murdered. Ibn lyas was on pilgrimage that year and\nwitnessed these events.” The story is told differently (with no\nmention of the dispute which ended in the murder of the qadi),\nand an Amir Sunqur al-Jamali is named as intendant of the\nworks, by the historian, Qutb al-Din al-Nahrawali.® The latter\nadds that the madrasa and a separate ribat too were completed\nin 884/1479-80 by that same amir.\n\nIn 885/1480 Qaytbay ordered the repair of the Imam al-\nShafi\'i’s Mausoleum in Cairo and appointed Shams al-Din\nMuhammad to be the intendant (shaidd) of the works.’ The next\nyear, 886/1481, he was sent by the sultan to Medina once more\nto effect a major re-building of the Holy Mosque, which had\nbeen seriously damaged by a fire caused by lightning. He took\nwith him a number (some three hundred) of masons,\ncarpenters and workers in marble. The whole Operation was\nnot finished until the end of 887/early 1483 and cost the sultan\nabout 100,000 dinars.\" The intendant is also said to have been\nJamal al-Din Sunqur al-Jamali, who was at that time engaged on\n\nbuilding work in Mecca! Under the year 897 Ibn Iyas gives the\nfollowing short notice:!2\n In Dhi\'l-Qa‘da [September-October 1492] there came\nfrom Mecca news of the death of the Khwaja Shams al- ie\nMuhammad b. al-Zamin. He was a notable merchant,\nknown for his great wealth, and a man of piety and\nbeneficence. He was the founder of the madrasa in Bulaq\'@\nnear the embankment (al-Rasif), a good and religious\nman, in whom there was no harm.\n\nThe comprehensive entry given in  al-Sakhawi’s\nbiographical dictionary’ confirms and amplifies what has been\ngiven above. Shams al-Din Muhammad b. ‘Umar b. al-Zamin al-\nQurashi al-Shafi‘T was born in Damascus in 824/1421, where he\ndid his early studies, and then followed his father into\ncommerce. His travels took him to Asia Minor and into the\nBalkans, as far as Semendira (Semendria), when it was still a\nChristian possession.\'° He acquired a house in Egypt, and\nhaving established an intimacy with Qaytbay, upon the latter\'s\naccession to the sultanate, was appointed overseer of building\nprojects in Mecca. He had earlier performed a pilgrimage in\n844/1441, and lived in Mecca on several different occasions. A\nson, called Jamal al-Din Muhammad, whose mother was a slave-\ngirl, was born in Mecca in Muharram 883/April 1478.\'’ Also\nresident in Mecca was a nephew, Ibrahim b. ‘Abd al-Karim b.\n‘Umar, who later married a daughter of Shams al-Din. It is\ninteresting to note that he too travelled in commerce, but\neastwards to the Malabar Coast. On the death of his uncle he\ncame back but then ‘returned with the seasonal convoy to\nDabhol’.\'® Shams al-Din’s death followed several months of\n illness contracted in Mecca, where he had travelled to perform\nthe pilgrimage in 896/1491. He returned to Cairo in a litter and\ndied almost on his arrival, Sunday, 18 Shawwal 897/12 August\n1492. The next day he was buried in his mausoleum.\n\nSUBSEQUENT HISTORY\n\nTwo sijill entries give some details of repairs carried out on\nwhat is referred to as the Zamaniyya Madrasa.

The cross vault of room ‘B’ rises to the same\nheight as the vaults of room ‘A’ and the vestibule, but a later\nfloor has at some time been inserted below it (see fig. 61.6).\nAlong with the door from room ‘A’ this room has a door (now\na window) in its east wall Opening under the Haram portico and\na door in its west wall Opening to a landing at the foot of the\nStairs to the upper floors. From the entrance vestibule a dog-leg\npassage, lit from the street by two windows, runs west and\ncomes to a dead end. Perhaps it originally gave access toa room\non the north, but there is now no trace of a doorway. The area\nto the north is inaccessible.\n\nMEZZANINE (plan, fig. 61.4)\n\nOn the north side of the vestibule three steps lead up through\na door into the landing at the foot of the staircase to the upper\nfloors. In the east wall of that landing is the door from room ‘B’.\nFrom the opposite (west) side six steps lead west up toasecond\nlanding where a doorway opens north into a corridor running\nWest to a pointed-arched window in the west wall of the\nbuilding. This corridor ives access to the two (originally\nthree) easternmost rooms (C-E) of the southern rubit‘ of Siq\nal-Qattanin (see above, p. 280). Both the Passage and the rooms\nmust have been incorporated into the ribat at the time of its\nconstruction. Stairs have been built into the middle room (D)\nto give access to a yard and adjoining room (plate 61.5) above\nbays 26-30 of Sug al-Qattanin, which appear to be Ottoman\nadditions (see above, p. 279). The easternmost room of the\nrubit’, larger than the others, is entered through a door at the\neast end of the corridor. That room has a window in its south\nwall opening on the landing at the foot of the Staircase, a door\nin the same wall giving access to the later room in the upper\nPart of room ‘A’, a window in its €ast wall opening under the\n\naoe portico, and three windows in its north wall opening on\nthe Suq.\n\nEisai ek\n\nO “CO meee\n room (J) lit by a window in the street facade (see section, fig.\n61.6).

The tenth/sixteenth and eleventh/seventeenth\ncentury documents cited above seem to imply that at the time\nwhen they were written there were on the portico roof\nbuildings associated with the ribat. Creswell’s 1920 photograph\n(plate 31.1) shows the facade of various structures in just that\nlocation, which were subsequently demolished in 1927. The\ndesign of one window in that facade has suggested that these\nstructures might have belonged to the ‘Uthmaniyya (see above,\np. 547), but the possibility that at least some of them belonged\nto the ribat cannot be ruled out.\n 1 Al“Umari, Masdlik, 162.\n\n2 Mujir, ii, 36.\n\n3 Mujir, loc. cit.\n\n4 CIA (Ville), no. 104.\n\n5 Wiistenfeld, Chroniken, iii, 225.\n\n6 Al-Samhidi, Wafa’ al-Wafa’, i, 442-3.\n\n7 Ibn lyas, iii, 145.\n\n8 Wiistenfeld, Chroniken, iii, 225-6.\n\n9 Ibn lyas, iii, 170.\n10 Ibn Ilyas, iii, 188.

Its founder was the Sultan al-Malik al-Ashraf Sayf al-Din\nAba Nasr Qéaytbay al-Mahmidi al-Zahiri’ It is quite\nunnecessary to give anything but a short notice of his life and\nlong reign (a little over twenty-nine years). A rough calculation\nfrom the date of his death and the age he had then attained\n(about eighty-four) suggests that he was born around about\n817/1414-15. He was Circassian by origin and was imported\ninto Egypt by a merchant called al-Khawaja Mahmtd (hence the\n‘al-Mahmiidi’ in his full name) in 839/1435-36, which means\nthat he was then more than twenty years of age. The Sultan al-\nAshraf Barsbay purchased him and he entered the barracks of\nthe royal mamliiks to begin his career. He was later bought\nfrom the Treasury by the Sultan al-Zahir Jaqmaq, who\neventually gave him his freedom. That accounts for the ‘al-\nZahiri’ in his name. It was not until 862/1457-58, when he was\nalready in his forties, that the Sultan Inal made him an amir of\n10. Thereafter his rise, under Khushqadam, was swift, and after\na period of confusion following the death of Khushqadam\nQaytbay was elevated to the sultanate — unwillingly, we are told. He came to the throne in Rajab 872/January 1468. He was\nmuch exercised by problems of foreign policy, with constant\ntrouble from the Aqqoyunlu and the Dhulghdadirids and the\ngrowing threat from the Ottomans. As his long reign continued\nso his authority in his own realms increased. He was a firm\nruler and noted for his scholarly and religious interests, and for\nhis ascetic life. He built extensively in Cairo and in the holy\ncities of the Hijaz and elsewhere. His death took place on\nSunday, 27 Dhu’l-Qa‘da 901/7 August 1496.','Before the major rebuilding the sultan appointed sixty Sifis, an\nunspecified number of law students and other service\npersonnel. These were supported by the assignment of waqfs\nin Gaza to the madrasa.”! The date of this early waqf was 877/\n1472 according to the later Ottoman defters, or more accurately\nas 5 Rabi‘ I 877/9 September 1472 by a Jerusalem sijill\nreference.” However, the extant wagfiyya copy in Cairo is\ndated 21 Shawwal 881/6 February 1477, an endowment with the\nrebuilding in mind, no doubt. A further endowment made by\nQaytbay, necessitated by extra expenditure, is dated 895/1489-\n90. The properties which formed the endowment for the\nAshrafiyya were very numerous indeed. They have been listed\nelsewhere” and there is little point in repeating all the names\nhere. Of the agricultural properties, consisting of widely\nvarying portions of village lands and mazraas, thirty-four\nbelonged to the district of Gaza, three to Hebron, two each to\nJerusalem and Ramla and one each to Nablus and the Hawran,\nmaking forty-three in all. The urban properties were all in Gaza\nand were made up of the caravanserai and eight shops in the\nTurcomans’ Market, six g@ as in that same quarter, along with a\nbath-house near the madrasa, a bakery, mill and two orchards,\n and outside the city in the Sheep Market, various shops, a gaa,\nand a press (mi sara).','As the Tankiziyya was used as the seat of the judiciary, so\nthe buildings of the Ashrafiyya were used for public inquiries.\nFor example, in 895/1490 the conduct in office of the governor\nof Jerusalem, Dugqmagq, was scrutinised by a_ royal\ncommissioner in the lower assembly hall.3° In 898/1492 an\ninquiry was held there into the operation of the madrasas of\nJerusalem and their supporting waqfs.*\" In fact, Mujir al-Din\nrecords that just a little earlier, in 890/1485, after the\ncompletion of the new building, the lower majma‘ was\nassigned to the imam of the Hanbalis to lead prayers there.\nFormerly, the Hanbali imam had used for that purpose the\nportico of the Haram, just below the Bab al-Silsila Minaret 22\nThis is confirmed by al-‘Umari.? As late as 1001/1592 this use by\nthe Hanbalis continued. Muhammad b. Ahmad al-Qudsi al-\nKhurrayshi, having studied in the Azhar, returned to Jerusalem\nwhere ‘he was imam of the Hanbalis in the assembly hall\n(majma ), which is below the madrasa of Qaytbay’ *4 In 902/1496 the Ashrafiyya, along with other buildings in\nJerusalem, suffered from an earthquake.» The damage at that\ntime must have been slight because subsequent Muslim visitors\nwrite of the madrasa as though it was still flourishing. Al-\nNabulusi gave a detailed independent description of the\nmadrasa with no hint of any destruction or dilapidation,>° and\n in 1080/1669-70 Evliya Celebi visited the building and climbed\nthe adjoining minaret to enjoy the panoramic view over the city\nand the Haram.’ As for Christian pilgrims, Pietro Casola after a\nvisit in 1494 remarked on a marvellous mosque built ten years\nbefore, which appears to be the Ashrafiyya. In that connection\nhe added that ‘it appears to me that the Moors do not lack good\nmaster workmen for their buildings’ ** Arnold von Harff, who\nsaw the building in 1498, wrote later of ‘a beautiful little\nmosque’, built by ‘the old Sultan Kathubee, who died five years\nago’, adding mistakenly that he is ‘honourably buried there’ 2?\n(i) Ottoman period\nThe appointments to offices within the madrasa which are\nrecorded in the sijills show that, as was the case generally, they\ntended to be transferred within families.“° It is odd to find that\nthe top posts of shaykh and administrator passed into the hands\nof the al-Dayri family, who were Hanafis, and to members of the\nIbn Jama‘a family, who had changed their allegiance from the\nShafi\'l school to the Hanafi, although the madrasa had been\nfounded as a Shafi‘ institution.“’ Furthermore, an attempt to\nabolish the separate post of mutawwalli and combine it with that\nof na@zir was unsuccessful. In 964/1557 a judgement to that\neffect was made by the Qadi of Jerusalem,” based ona reading\nof the wagfiyya — and strangely enough the wadfiyya dated 877/\n1472, not the later ones — a royal decree -appointing the then\nholder of the administratorship after the death of the\nmutawalliya, Misti Khunad, a descendant of the royal founder,\nin that same year, and finally a fatwa from the Mufti of Istanbul.\nIt should also be noted that some of the sijill entries refer to ‘the\nwaqf of the two madrasas’, those founded by Qaytbay at\nJerusalem and Gaza, as though the administration had been\namalgamated after the destruction of the madrasa at Gaza.\nThat was the case with an account presented by ‘the\nmutawalli of the waqf of the two madrasas . .. inJerusalem and\nGaza’ in the year 962/1555.* All the expenditure was for the\npersonnel of the Jerusalem foundation, which included thirty\nindividuals described as ‘Siifis, readers of Koran parts’ and\neight law students (talaba). This last category is rare for any of\nthe Jerusalem institutions of learning in the sijills that have\nbeen examined and certainly suggests a continued functioning.\nThe wagf lands were leased or farmed out. In 964/1556-57\nMusa b. al-Shaykh ‘Ali al-Khalwati was given the farm of the\nrents from two shares (i.e. 2 girdits, each being a twenty-fourth)\nof Bayt Dajan, two and a third shares of Qatra, and five-eighths\nofa share of al-Safiriyya (?), all described as ‘the waaf of the two\n madrasas’.“! Four years later the ndzir leases to the mudarris,\nor at least the mzudarris named for the year 966, these same\nlands and several others for a sum, 88 gold pieces, which is then\nassigned to him as his salary for that same year, and he was\nmade agent for the collection of the rents outstanding.* In later\nyears, rent arrears for two years from two villages, Ibya (?) and\nMajid, were recovered from a Nur Allah Jawish, whose father,\nHasan Jawish, could only produce proof of having paid one\nyear’s rent of a three year lease.*° The practice of convening inquiries in the Ashrafiyya\ncontinued. In 967/1560 a majlis was held there before the\ngovernor of Jerusalem to look into the Jewish community’s\nleasing of the Salahiyya Madrasa’s waqf lands in Gethsemane as\na cemetery.”\n ','IDENTIFICATION\n\nThe Ashrafiyya is identified by the extant inscriptions (see\nbelow) and many descriptions and fixings of its position, not\nleast in the copy of the wadfiyya.\n\nFOUNDER\n\nLa f | PSP PS Eee eme a NEE EME pr Pe MNRAS utc? a5 > Ws rete\n period.

A rough calculation\nfrom the date of his death and the age he had then attained\n(about eighty-four) suggests that he was born around about\n817/1414-15. He was Circassian by origin and was imported\ninto Egypt by a merchant called al-Khawaja Mahmtd (hence the\n‘al-Mahmiidi’ in his full name) in 839/1435-36, which means\nthat he was then more than twenty years of age. The Sultan al-\nAshraf Barsbay purchased him and he entered the barracks of\nthe royal mamliiks to begin his career. He was later bought\nfrom the Treasury by the Sultan al-Zahir Jaqmaq, who\neventually gave him his freedom. That accounts for the ‘al-\nZahiri’ in his name. It was not until 862/1457-58, when he was\nalready in his forties, that the Sultan Inal made him an amir of\n10. Thereafter his rise, under Khushqadam, was swift, and after\na period of confusion following the death of Khushqadam\nQaytbay was elevated to the sultanate — unwillingly, we are told.\n\nHe came to the throne in Rajab 872/January 1468. He was\nmuch exercised by problems of foreign policy, with constant\ntrouble from the Aqqoyunlu and the Dhulghdadirids and the\ngrowing threat from the Ottomans. As his long reign continued\nso his authority in his own realms increased. He was a firm\nruler and noted for his scholarly and religious interests, and for\nhis ascetic life. He built extensively in Cairo and in the holy\ncities of the Hijaz and elsewhere. His death took place on\nSunday, 27 Dhu’l-Qa‘da 901/7 August 1496.\n\nDATE\nThe story of the building on the site near the Chain Gate is a\ncomplicated one. In the first place a madrasa was begun in the\nname of the Sultan Khushqadam by the Amir Hasan b. Tatar al-\nZahiri.° Hasan came to Jerusalem to act as Superintendent of\nthe Two Harams in Jumada II 869/February 1465,’ so the\nbuilding was presumably begun after that date. Khushqadam\ndied in Rabi‘ I 872/October 1467 and there followed two short\nreigns of altogether just over one hundred days. Then, at the\nbeginning of Qéaytbay’s sultanate, Hasan al-Zahiri was\ndismissed and went to Cairo to persuade Qaytbay to take over\nthe madrasa (or such of it as had been completed at that time).\nThis the sultan agreed to do and ‘inscribed his [own] name over\nthe door’ ®\n\nThis may refer to the inscription now found under the\nnoc of the Bab al-Sakina about six metres above ground-\nevel:\n\nThe construction of this noble madrasa was ordered by\nour Lord the Sultan al-Malik al-Ashraf Abi: Nasr Qaytbay\n(may his triumph be mighty) on the first day of the month\nof Rabi‘ I in the year eight hundred and seventy-five [28\nAugust 1470] during the time of our lord, his most noble\nexcellency, Nasir al-Din Sidi Muhammad the Treasurer,\nSuperintendent of the Two Noble Harams (may God\nmagnify his position).\n\nOne might imagine that this inscription records the date of\nthe completion of the madrasa in its initial guise. However, the\nsuperintendent named (he was Nasir al-Din Muhammad al-\nNashashibi) took up his appointment in his own right\n(istiglalan) in Muharram 875/July 1470,\"° that is, only a month\nbefore. He had, it is true, been present in Jerusalem since the\nPrevious year to correct the disorders and administrative\nirregularities which were the legacy of his predecessor,\nBardibak al-Taji.\'\' Yet the above inscription was, as van\nBerchem has shown, completed in two separate stages. The\ndate and the name of the superintendent were added later than\nthe rest in a separate roundel.!? According to Mujir al-Din, it\nwas Bardibak al-Taji who in the year 873/1468-69 ‘saw to the\ncompletion of the madrasa, provided doors for itand furnished\nit with carpets.’\n\nIn Rajab 880/November 1475 Qaytbay paid a visit to\nJerusalem, where he found the madrasa he had accepted as his\n Own not to his liking.” A few years later, in 884/1479-80, he sent\nan officer from his court (khdssaki) to see to the demolition and\nextension of the building. The digging of the new foundations\nbegan on the 14 Sha‘ban 885/19 October 1480.” In the\nfollowing year the sultan sent a team of craftsmen from Cairo to\nwork on the new madrasa. Further changes in the design were\nthen made by the Christian architect who accompanied them. \'®\n\nVan Berchem has argued that these changes concerned\nthe advancing of the building line of the majma‘ (assembly\nhall) beyond that of the Haram portico to make it jut out into the\nHaram.”’ It seems that he has forced a meaning upon the text of\nMujir al-Din which is not the obvious one. After the destruction\nof the old madrasa ‘which was on the portico of the Haram, the\nbuilders embarked on the new construction and built the\nlower assembly hall, adjoining (mudsiq) the Haram portico to\nthe east’.’* One would naturally understand from this that the\nbuilding was outside the building line of the portico. If it is\nargued that in this passage Mujir al-Din is looking beyond the\nmodifications made by the Christian architect and considering\nthe final stage of the building as it is today, one could ask why\nthen does Mujir al-Din use very similar language in his\ndescription (which is later in terms of the progress of his\nchronicle) of what is manifestly the building before the\narchitect wished to change it: ‘when he saw the lower assembly\nhall built in the Haram next to (bi-/asq) the portico, he did not\nlike itand wished to demolish it completely’.’’ To claim that the\ntext here refers to a building within the alignment of the\nportico is very difficult. In fact, the architect was unable to do as\nhe wished, for reasons that are not specified, and he contented\nhimself with demolishing part of the assembly hall on the south\nside and also three arches of the Haram portico ‘near the door\nleading to the minaret’. Purely on the basis of these passages,\nthe Christian architect’s demolition could have been directed\ntowards the building of the grand portal of the madrasa. That\nwas his contribution, while the advancement of the majma‘\nbeyond the portico had been planned from 885/1480. After all,\nQaytbay had taken against the madrasa presumably because it\nwas too small and had ordered its enlargement in 884/1479-80.\n\nThe main construction work of the new madrasa was\ncompleted after a couple of years and the date was recorded on\nan inscription band on either side of the entrance within the\nnew imposing portal:\n\nThe construction of this blessed madrasa was ordered by\nthe exalted imam and the revered prince, the Sultan al-\nMalik al-Ashraf Abi Nasr (may his triumph be mighty). It\nwas completed in the month of Rajab the Unique in the\nyear eight hundred and eighty-seven [August-September\n1482].\n\nENDOWMENT\n\nBefore the major rebuilding the sultan appointed sixty Sifis, an\nunspecified number of law students and other service\npersonnel. These were supported by the assignment of waqfs\nin Gaza to the madrasa.”! The date of this early waqf was 877/\n1472 according to the later Ottoman defters, or more accurately\nas 5 Rabi‘ I 877/9 September 1472 by a Jerusalem sijill\nreference.” However, the extant wagfiyya copy in Cairo is\ndated 21 Shawwal 881/6 February 1477, an endowment with the\nrebuilding in mind, no doubt. A further endowment made by\nQaytbay, necessitated by extra expenditure, is dated 895/1489-\n90. The properties which formed the endowment for the\nAshrafiyya were very numerous indeed. They have been listed\nelsewhere” and there is little point in repeating all the names\nhere. Of the agricultural properties, consisting of widely\nvarying portions of village lands and mazraas, thirty-four\nbelonged to the district of Gaza, three to Hebron, two each to\nJerusalem and Ramla and one each to Nablus and the Hawran,\nmaking forty-three in all. The urban properties were all in Gaza\nand were made up of the caravanserai and eight shops in the\nTurcomans’ Market, six g@ as in that same quarter, along with a\nbath-house near the madrasa, a bakery, mill and two orchards,\n and outside the city in the Sheep Market, various shops, a gaa,\nand a press (mi sara).\n\nSUBSEQUENT HISTORY\n(i) Mamltk period y\nWhile Khushqadam was still living, Shihab al-Din al-‘Umayri al-\nShafi had been appointed as the first shaykh of the initial\nmadrasa.™* After its completion by Bardibak in 873/1468-69 he\ngave his inaugural lecture in the assembly room before the\nQadis and the ulema on the Koranic text, ‘He only shall cause\nGod\'s mosques to prosper who believes in God and the Last\nDay, etc.” He was confirmed by Qaytbay in 876/1471.”° It is said\nthat in 886/1481 Burhan al-Din al-Karaki was replaced as\nshaykh by Salih al-Din al-Tarabulusi,”” and yet, when in 890/\n1485 Kamal al-Din b. Abi Sharif was given the headship of the\nnew madrasa, it was ‘by virtue of the death of al-‘Umayri’.® With\nthe arrival of Ibn Abi Sharif and his installation in the presence\nof many dignitaries, the new madrasa became fully operational.\nJust two years before, when Felix Fabri visited Jerusalem, he\nhad been able to visit the madrasa, which was still in the process\nof having its internal decoration and furnishing completed.”\n\nAs the Tankiziyya was used as the seat of the judiciary, so\nthe buildings of the Ashrafiyya were used for public inquiries.\nFor example, in 895/1490 the conduct in office of the governor\nof Jerusalem, Dugqmagq, was scrutinised by a_ royal\ncommissioner in the lower assembly hall.3° In 898/1492 an\ninquiry was held there into the operation of the madrasas of\nJerusalem and their supporting waqfs.*\" In fact, Mujir al-Din\nrecords that just a little earlier, in 890/1485, after the\ncompletion of the new building, the lower majma‘ was\nassigned to the imam of the Hanbalis to lead prayers there.\nFormerly, the Hanbali imam had used for that purpose the\nportico of the Haram, just below the Bab al-Silsila Minaret 22\nThis is confirmed by al-‘Umari.? As late as 1001/1592 this use by\nthe Hanbalis continued. Muhammad b. Ahmad al-Qudsi al-\nKhurrayshi, having studied in the Azhar, returned to Jerusalem\nwhere ‘he was imam of the Hanbalis in the assembly hall\n(majma ), which is below the madrasa of Qaytbay’ *4\n\nIn 902/1496 the Ashrafiyya, along with other buildings in\nJerusalem, suffered from an earthquake.» The damage at that\ntime must have been slight because subsequent Muslim visitors\nwrite of the madrasa as though it was still flourishing. Al-\nNabulusi gave a detailed independent description of the\nmadrasa with no hint of any destruction or dilapidation,>° and\n in 1080/1669-70 Evliya Celebi visited the building and climbed\nthe adjoining minaret to enjoy the panoramic view over the city\nand the Haram.’ As for Christian pilgrims, Pietro Casola after a\nvisit in 1494 remarked on a marvellous mosque built ten years\nbefore, which appears to be the Ashrafiyya. In that connection\nhe added that ‘it appears to me that the Moors do not lack good\nmaster workmen for their buildings’ ** Arnold von Harff, who\nsaw the building in 1498, wrote later of ‘a beautiful little\nmosque’, built by ‘the old Sultan Kathubee, who died five years\nago’, adding mistakenly that he is ‘honourably buried there’ 2?\n(i) Ottoman period\nThe appointments to offices within the madrasa which are\nrecorded in the sijills show that, as was the case generally, they\ntended to be transferred within families.“° It is odd to find that\nthe top posts of shaykh and administrator passed into the hands\nof the al-Dayri family, who were Hanafis, and to members of the\nIbn Jama‘a family, who had changed their allegiance from the\nShafi\'l school to the Hanafi, although the madrasa had been\nfounded as a Shafi‘ institution.“’ Furthermore, an attempt to\nabolish the separate post of mutawwalli and combine it with that\nof na@zir was unsuccessful. In 964/1557 a judgement to that\neffect was made by the Qadi of Jerusalem,” based ona reading\nof the wagfiyya — and strangely enough the wadfiyya dated 877/\n1472, not the later ones — a royal decree -appointing the then\nholder of the administratorship after the death of the\nmutawalliya, Misti Khunad, a descendant of the royal founder,\nin that same year, and finally a fatwa from the Mufti of Istanbul.\nIt should also be noted that some of the sijill entries refer to ‘the\nwaqf of the two madrasas’, those founded by Qaytbay at\nJerusalem and Gaza, as though the administration had been\namalgamated after the destruction of the madrasa at Gaza.\nThat was the case with an account presented by ‘the\nmutawalli of the waqf of the two madrasas . .. inJerusalem and\nGaza’ in the year 962/1555.* All the expenditure was for the\npersonnel of the Jerusalem foundation, which included thirty\nindividuals described as ‘Siifis, readers of Koran parts’ and\neight law students (talaba). This last category is rare for any of\nthe Jerusalem institutions of learning in the sijills that have\nbeen examined and certainly suggests a continued functioning.\nThe wagf lands were leased or farmed out. In 964/1556-57\nMusa b. al-Shaykh ‘Ali al-Khalwati was given the farm of the\nrents from two shares (i.e. 2 girdits, each being a twenty-fourth)\nof Bayt Dajan, two and a third shares of Qatra, and five-eighths\nofa share of al-Safiriyya (?), all described as ‘the waaf of the two\n madrasas’.“! Four years later the ndzir leases to the mudarris,\nor at least the mzudarris named for the year 966, these same\nlands and several others for a sum, 88 gold pieces, which is then\nassigned to him as his salary for that same year, and he was\nmade agent for the collection of the rents outstanding.* In later\nyears, rent arrears for two years from two villages, Ibya (?) and\nMajid, were recovered from a Nur Allah Jawish, whose father,\nHasan Jawish, could only produce proof of having paid one\nyear’s rent of a three year lease.*°\n\nThe practice of convening inquiries in the Ashrafiyya\ncontinued. In 967/1560 a majlis was held there before the\ngovernor of Jerusalem to look into the Jewish community’s\nleasing of the Salahiyya Madrasa’s waqf lands in Gethsemane as\na cemetery.”\n ','IDENTIFICATION, FOUNDER, DATE, ENDOWMENT, SUBSEQUENT HISTORY'),(64,'','','','','ee ee,\n\nLittle of the early history of the sabil is known. Mujir al-Din tells\nus that\n\n... among the buildings restored by Sultan Qaytbay when\nhe rebuilt his madrasa was the sabil facing it in the interior\nof the Haram, above the well opposite the west stair of the\n[Dome of the] Rock. Astone dome formerly stood over this\nwell, like the other wells? in the Haram. It was demolished\nand the new sabil was built, the floor paved in marble, and\nit had an elegant appearance.‘\n\nThus, according to Mujir al-Din, an earlier domed sabil once\nstood on the site. The date of that earlier dome is not known\nexactly, but around the present sabil an inscription,\ncommemorating restorations made in 1300/1883 by the\nOttoman Sultan ‘Abd al-Hamid, includes the information that\nthe original structure was erected by the Mamlik Sultan Inal\n(reigned from 857/1453 to 865/1461) and was rebuilt by Sultan\nQaytbay in Shawwal 887/November-December 1482. Van\nBerchem? deduced that the text of this restoration inscription is\nin fact a slightly abbreviated version of an earlier inscription,\nseen and roughly copied by Sauvaire in 1865,° which\ncommemorated Qaytbay’s rebuilding.\n\nApart from his two major surviving monuments in\nJerusalem — this sabil and the nearby madrasa — Qaytbay was\nresponsible also for the renovation in 874/1469 of the main\naqueduct to the city’ and for the construction of two fountains\n(fisqiyya), one just to the south of the platform on which his\n\nsabil stands and one between the two Haram gates Bab al-Silsila\nand Bab al-Sakina.®\n Christel Kessler, in an article devoted to Qaytbay’s sabil,\nspeculated that it was built by the same team of Egyptian\ncraftsmen after they had completed the construction work on\nQaytbay’s madrasa some three months before the date\nmentioned in the sabil’s inscription.\n ','');
